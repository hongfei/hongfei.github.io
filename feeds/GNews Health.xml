&lt;h2&gt;Key Facts&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services &lt;a href="https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" aria-label="reported"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; its outbreak had grown to 198 cases of measles as of Friday, with 23 of the patients having been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Texas health department said just five of the cases are in vaccinated people, with the remainder of the sick patients being unvaccinated (80) or having an unknown vaccination status (113).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the New Mexico Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" aria-label="said"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; a deceased man in Lea County who was unvaccinated against measles tested positive for the virus, though they said he did not seek medical care before passing and “the official cause of death is still under investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lea County, New Mexico, is home to all 30 of the state’s confirmed measles cases, and is about 47 miles from Gaines County, Texas, where the majority of Texas’ measles cases have been detected.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Where In Texas Is The Measles Outbreak?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 137 of the measles cases are located in Gaines County, a rural area about an hour-and-a-half west of Lubbock. The remaining cases are in Terry County (29), Dawson County (9), Yoakum County (8), Dallam County (5), Martin County (3), Lubbock County (3), Ector County (2) and Lynn County (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket" vest-pocket=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Age Groups Is The Measles Outbreak Impacting In Texas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty-nine of the cases have been among people aged five to 17, while 64 cases were among children between the ages of zero and four and 34 were reported among adults over age 18. The ages of 11 patients have not been stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/fbs-ad&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Are There Outbreaks In Other States?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is an outbreak in New Mexico, where &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" aria-label="30 cases"&gt;30 cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in Lea County, which is on the border with Texas. Outside of Texas and New Mexico, anywhere from one to nine cases have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" aria-label="reported by the CDC"&gt;reported by the CDC&lt;/a&gt; in California, Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky, Florida, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Are Measles Symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include a fever, rash, cough, fatigue, runny nose and red eyes. The symptoms do not appear until 10 to 14 days after someone is exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;How Contagious Is Measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and can spread from one person to nine out of 10 people close to them, according to the CDC, which notes a person infected with measles can spread it to others four days before through four days after the rash appears. Measles can spread through coughing, sneezing and infected surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Is There A Measles Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, and it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." aria-label="highly effective and safe"&gt;highly effective and safe&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which has been available for over half a century, is about 97% effective at preventing measles with the standard two doses and 93% effective with one dose. The vaccine is typically given to people when they are children, with one dose administered between 12 to 15 months and another administered between four to six years old. The vaccine generally provides long-term or lifelong protection. There is no problem with getting the vaccine if you are an adult unsure of their vaccination status, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" aria-label="NPR"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;. Adults born after 1957 and vaccinated before 1968 should consider getting revaccinated, NPR reported, noting early measles vaccines are not as effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Has Rfk Jr. Said About The Measles Outbreak And Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After claiming the outbreak is “not unusual,” Kennedy changed his stance and considered it “serious,” saying in a March 3 &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" aria-label="statement"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; “the measles outbreak in Texas is a call to action for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to public health.” Kennedy, a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" aria-label="vaccine skeptic"&gt;vaccine skeptic&lt;/a&gt;, said vaccines contribute to community immunity, but did not explicitly tell people to get vaccinated and noted the “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one.” He also supported the use of vitamin A under the supervision of a physician to treat people with mild, moderate, and severe infection, creating concerns among health experts who have cautioned about the vitamin’s effectiveness. Sue Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" aria-label="The Washington Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; that solely relying on vitamin A instead of the MMR vaccine is “dangerous and ineffective” and can put children at risk, noting too much vitamin A can “cause serious health problems, including liver damage.” Meanwhile, advocacy non-profit Children’s Health Defense, which was founded and once chaired by RFK Jr., has attacked the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" aria-label="quoted skeptics"&gt;quoted skeptics&lt;/a&gt; who claimed measles was “an insignificant inconvenience until we turned it into a literal neurological damage nightmare through the MMR vaccine campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Crucial Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities,” according to The Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Key Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas measles outbreak began in late January with just two cases and has become the state’s largest outbreak of the virus in 30 years. The Texas Department of State Health Services said in a &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" aria-label="report"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; of student immunization status for the 2023-2024 school year that 5.64% of Texas kindergarten students were not vaccinated for measles, while 2.34% of seventh graders had not received the vaccine. Measles was fully eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the virus was not spreading within the country and new cases only came from people who contracted measles abroad and returned to the U.S. In 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported across 33 states.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;SEMINOLE, Texas – Last Saturday, Zach Holbrooks walked into a mobile measles screening and vaccine clinic he had helped set up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the executive director of the &lt;a href="https://southplainshealth.org/" target="_blank"&gt;South Plains Public Health District&lt;/a&gt;, which includes Gaines County, he dropped by to check on how many shots the crew had given out so far that day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Has it been busy today?" Holbrooks asked the two staffers in what's normally a livestock show barn on the outskirts of downtown Seminole. "Not so far. We've only given one," they replied.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Holbrooks works and lives in this town, the county seat, which in the last few weeks became the epicenter of the largest measles outbreak in three decades.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, March 4, one 6-year-old unvaccinated child had died of the measles. There are now &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;159 confirmed cases and 22 hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt;, but local health authorities say the true total is likely much higher.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says outbreaks tend to occur when the vaccination rate&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html__;!!Iwwt!WOht7WM-b65xhcncf6ZyqjlBqbKTRaIxWB-NlqKDVH0JWldhrMa3FkN8ikXMnavEP7uPA4dFvFvxPawOGro$" target="_blank"&gt; in a community dips below 95%&lt;/a&gt;. The kindergarten vaccination rate for measles, mumps and rubella on record in Gaines County sits at 82%, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" target="_blank"&gt;state health records&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But many children there are homeschooled or attend private primary school, so those rates could be even lower.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Holbrooks has been busy since the outbreak started in late January. He's been setting up mobile testing and vaccination sites; he said this remote part of West Texas has a large immigrant population, many whose immunization records are unknown, so he's been circulating flyers with measles information in different languages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have a mix of people out here, a large German speaking population, Spanish speaking population," which he said makes getting residents the right information about disease control even more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Authorities still don't know how the measles got to Seminole, but John Belcher, the town's former mayor, said he understands why it's spreading beyond the city limits.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Folks who live out here basically have to drive everywhere, he said. They hop in the car or truck and drive miles to get groceries, go to doctor's appointments, attend church and to get to work.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'd say within 200 miles, maybe even farther, if there's a metal building out there, it came from products manufactured in Gaines County," Belcher said. "And the building was probably put together by companies from Gaines County."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People here need to drive about 80 miles to catch a flight at the Lubbock Airport.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Others travel often to nearby communities in Lea County, on the New Mexico side of the state line. That state has &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/__;!!Iwwt!WOht7WM-b65xhcncf6ZyqjlBqbKTRaIxWB-NlqKDVH0JWldhrMa3FkN8ikXMnavEP7uPA4dFvFvxrvRiLIE$" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 10 confirmed measles cases. On Thursday, New Mexico Health officials confirmed that an unvaccinated adult testing positive for the virus has died.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-52432" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A sense of normalcy&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Seminole, the outbreak has mainly infected children since early January.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Local authorities say the Mennonite community has been hit hard by measles, though they don't have an exact number of confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Grub Shack, a restaurant owned and run by a Mennonite family, seems to be running at full steam. Other businesses in downtown Seminole and people just carry on with their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many Mennonites immigrated here in the late 1970s. There remain thousands of Mennonites in Seminole some 50 years later.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tina Siemens' father moved his family here from northern Mexico in 1976 when she was 8. She was raised Mennonite and manages the &lt;a href="https://wtlhm.com/" target="_blank"&gt;West Texas Living Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;, which tells the history of this part of West Texas' Native American and Mennonite heritage.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While many Mennonites are not against vaccines in principle, Siemens said, some seek other solutions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The Mennonites are very keen on home remedies," Siemens said. "So there may be a family that, nobody knows that they might have all had the measles."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The state's health officials have said there's plenty of vaccine for everyone who needs it, and Holbrooks said he doesn't think it's a lack of access to the vaccine that's spreading measles out here.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At last count, 214 people in Gaines County have been vaccinated for measles since the outbreak. Holbrooks believes that number is not higher because some people fear debunked ideas about its safety.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I just think there's some vaccine hesitancy, even more so since COVID," Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-50709" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the measles vaccine is safe and two doses prevent infection, not just severe illness, 97% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Julie Carter has lived in Seminole all her life. Her three kids are adults: 19, 22 and 30 years old. They got the measles vaccine before starting elementary school, but she became a vaccine skeptic when she started researching ways to improve her health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was overweight; I wasn't feeling good," Carter said. "I kind of went on a journey where I got educated. I came across the vaccine thing and wasn't sure how healthy those were."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health officials say doubts about vaccines continue to hamper vaccination efforts. Plus, this illness has not been a major public health issue. In 2000, the CDC declared the virus eliminated from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Holbrooks said that for a lot of younger parents, measles is a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's not something that people thought a lot about," he said. But he's urging those in the community to do just that because the consequences can be severe. "If it was just a simple rash, a rash won't lead to brain inflammation, intellectual disability, death, pneumonia, deafness, convulsions."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And measles, one of the most contagious known viruses, can spread for days without a person feeling sick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Two people have now died in the growing measles outbreak in west Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;New Mexico Health officials on Thursday confirmed the death of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309800/texas-measles-child-death-vaccination" target="_blank"&gt;The first death was a school-age child&lt;/a&gt; in Gaines County, Texas last week.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;News of a second death comes as infectious disease doctors worry that the federal government's messaging about the outbreak is putting more emphasis on treatments like vitamin A than on vaccination, even as misinformation about some of these treatments is spreading online.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those concerns come in the wake of recent comments made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy addressed the growing measles outbreak in an editorial for FOX News published on Sunday, also &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html#:~:text=Measles%20is%20a%20highly%20contagious,breathes%2C%20coughs%2C%20or%20sneezes" target="_blank"&gt;posted on the HHS website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;While mentioning the value of vaccination for community immunity, Kennedy said "the decision to vaccinate is a personal one." He emphasized treatment for measles, saying that vitamin A can "dramatically" reduce deaths from the disease. In an&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369595673112" target="_blank"&gt; interview with FOX News&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday, he said Texas doctors are giving steroids and cod liver oil to their measles patients and "getting very, very, good results."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In his editorial, he said good nutrition is "a best defense against most chronic and infectious illnesses."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That emphasis on nutrition and vitamin A to treat measles is concerning some infectious disease doctors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Mentions of cod liver oil and vitamins [are] just distracting people away from what the single message should be, which is to increase the vaccination rate, " said&lt;a href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/amesh-adalja-md-fidsa" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Amesh Adalja, &lt;/a&gt;an infectious disease physician and senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While vitamin A can play a role in preventing severe disease, discussion of vitamins, "doesn't replace the fact that measles is a preventable disease. And really, the way to deal with a measles outbreak is to vaccinate people against measles," says&lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1972558187/adam-j-ratner" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Adam Ratner, &lt;/a&gt;a member of the infectious disease committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy did acknowledge that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread" target="_blank"&gt;measles is highly contagious &lt;/a&gt;and that it poses health risks, especially to people who are not vaccinated. He said vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also protect people who can't be vaccinated. But he didn't strongly encourage people to get their children vaccinated — which is usually a key part of the public health response during an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In 2019, when a measles outbreak was raging in the U.S., then health secretary Alex Azar &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/24/716953746/cdc-reports-largest-u-s-measles-outbreak-since-year-2000" target="_blank"&gt;came out with a statement&lt;/a&gt; strongly supporting vaccination and warning of the risks of under-vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to vitamin A, studies conducted decades ago in low and middle-income countries found that the vitamin can reduce the risk of severe disease and death, in children who are malnourished and have vitamin deficiencies, says Adalja.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;There's also evidence that, even in the absence of a pre-existing deficiency, measles seems to deplete the body's stores of vitamin A. Both&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076287/" target="_blank"&gt; the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend giving two doses of vitamin A to children who have the disease, especially if they are so sick they are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But, Ratner stresses that vitamin A does not &lt;em&gt;prevent&lt;/em&gt; measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A false idea circulating online is that giving children high doses over long periods of time can prevent measles, says Ratner. He says that's not only wrong but can be quite dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Vitamin A can accumulate in the body," he says. "It can be toxic to the liver. It can have effects that you don't want for your child," like liver damage, fatigue, hair loss and headaches. Ratner works as a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City. He says that similar misinformation about vitamin A made the rounds during the city's measles outbreak in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scott Weaver, &lt;a href="https://microbiology.utmb.edu/faculty/scott-weaver-phd" target="_blank"&gt;director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Texas Medical Branch, says he worries people might look at a vitamin bottle and think, "Well, maybe if I take two or three times this amount, I'll be even better protected against measles.&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm concerned that people think that vitamin A or other nutrition is a substitute for vaccination to prevent infection and to prevent spread," Weaver says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In his Fox News interview, Kennedy said Texas doctors are "getting very, very, good results." with a mix of treatments including steroids and cod liver oil. NPR has not confirmed the use of cod liver oil in Texas, but Adalja says, "there's no data that cod liver oil is going to have any benefit on measles."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And because cod liver oil is so high in vitamin A, Ratner worries parents could end up giving their children too much – potentially toxic amounts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adalja would have liked Kennedy to emphasize that&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" target="_blank"&gt; vaccines are the best defense against measles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Then you don't even have to think about treatment, because when it comes to an infectious disease, prevention is always better than treatment," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Very happy, silly and funny."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A memorial service is set for 11 a.m. Friday at the Transfiguration of Christ Church in Corona, Queens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Glen Oaks native&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margaret Elenis was born and raised in Glen Oaks, the middle of three children to Antonios Elenis, 62, and Elisabeth Elenis, 61, who together operated a family-owned plumbing business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduating from Francis Lewis High School in Fresh Meadows, Margaret Elenis attended Baruch College for two years, where she played on the school's basketball team, before transferring to Queens College, earning a bachelor's degree in special education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She would go on to teach special education, and later become a dean, at William Cullen Bryant High School in Astoria for seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, she married Vasili Siklas, and together they had two sons, Konstantino, 9, and Alexandro, 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Elenis Siklas was 28, nearly three years after the birth of Konstantino, she was diagnosed with stage-two breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a year later, after changing her lifestyle — eating healthier and taking a high dosage of vitamins — the cancer went into remission without any chemotherapy or radiation, her sister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly thereafter, Elenis Siklas began to notice she could no longer take Konstantino to their favorite indoor play area because the food there didn't fit into her now-healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, she and her sister opened "Oh My Goodness Kids," in Garden City, which she described to Newsday in 2023 as a "sanctuary where everything is healthy for kids ... a safe space here we could promote a better lifestyle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pregnancy complications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elenis Siklas became pregnant for a second time in 2020 but the cancer quickly returned in a much more aggressive form, creating major complications, family members said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors delivered Alexandro at 30 weeks "because I wasn’t going to make it," spending a month going back and forth from the treatment center to the NICU, Elenis Siklas told Newsday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of Alexandro's birth, Elenis Siklas had already been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer, her sister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even while continuing to battle cancer, Elenis Siklas was determined to grow the business, opening a second location in Port Washington and expanding to include drop-off programs, as well as cooking and yoga for older children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, there’s a negative to getting cancer, but this is my opportunity," she told Newsday at the time. "I chose to pursue a path where I know I’m doing something for the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Thinking of others&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last April, even as her health continued to deteriorate, Elenis Siklas established &lt;a href="https://ball4lifegives.com/"&gt;Ball4Life&lt;/a&gt;, a basketball fundraiser for women and mothers battling breast cancer. The group's second annual event is scheduled for next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She was a force. She had an unbreakable spirit and never took no for an answer," said Irene Candela, 38, of Port Washington, Elenis Siklas' cousin. "A lot of people always talk about what they want to do or what they wish would happen. But she made anything happen that she wanted to happen ... She never wanted help or to accept anything from anyone. She wanted to help everyone else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As news spread on social media of Elenis Siklas' passing this week, a flood of friends and customers took to Oh My Goodness Kids' Instagram page to share stories and describe her as an "inspiration" and a "warrior" who constantly lifted the community's spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with her husband, two children, sister and parents, Elenis Siklas is survived by a brother, Emmanuel Elenis, 37, of Malverne, and several in-laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lieu of flowers, the family asked that donations be made to Ball4life, located at 25-18 50th Street in Woodside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Robert Brodsky" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=96&amp;amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;

                                    &lt;span class="half-and-half__title h5"&gt;Cop16 deal hailed a ‘step forward’ for nature protection&lt;/span&gt;
                
                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wealthy nations have agreed to mobilise at least $200bn (£155bn) per year by 2030 to help developing countries conserve biodiversity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The commitment was hammered out in Rome, Italy, at the resumed Cop16 talks, which broke down in Colombia last November. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Agreed by the 196 states that signed up to the Convention on Biological Diversity (including Russia, but excluding the US), the deal was hailed a win for multilateralism in uncertain times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Negotiators from all countries … put their differences aside to forge a common path forward,” said Lin Li, senior director for global policy at WWF International. “What’s left now is an urgent need to mobilise funding … to ensure we reach the $200bn a year committed by 2030.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An Lambrechts, head of Greenpeace’s Cop16 delegation, agreed. “It is now crucial that global north countries honour their commitments and translate today’s decisions into real funding to protect biodiversity.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite the progress, many countries wanted to see greater ambition to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 – a target that looks likely to be missed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

About 20 years ago, I had prostate cancer and went through 43 weeks of radiation. My PSA level in the past year has risen slightly from .03 ng/mL to .09 ng/mL. My internist has suggested that I get a PET scan. Do you think this is necessary?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— H.L.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear H.L.:&lt;/strong&gt; When the PSA level rises after radiation treatment for prostate cancer, there could be some prostate cancer cells that survived the treatment and are growing. The usual threshold to be concerned about is 0.2 ng/mL, which you would be expected to get to in about one to three years if your PSA keeps rising. (It may not.) This situation is often called a "biochemical recurrence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If the PSA level is rising quickly, or you had a very aggressive tumor (determined by pathology called the Gleason score; your internist or urologist should know this information), this would be more worrisome. On the other hand, since your PSA level is still quite low, and it has been 20 years, the risk of prostate cancer getting big enough to bother you during your lifetime is small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I certainly recommend that you go back and see your urologist, who probably has more experience than an internist like me. Some urologists do get PET scans in this situation once the PSA is above 0.2 ng/mL, but I am not sure that you need it. Much depends on your PSA level when it's next checked in 6-12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; My otherwise-healthy 65-year-old wife takes large amounts of vitamins and supplements a day. Her doctor says this is fine, but it looks to be a lot more than a dozen. Do large amounts of vitamins and supplements actually have a beneficial effect? I know vitamins are necessary, but to this extent? Could large amounts be detrimental?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— S.W.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear S.W.:&lt;/strong&gt; Many studies have been designed to determine whether supplemental vitamins and minerals lead to a benefit in healthy people. As a group, they have consistently failed to show any benefit in the quality or length of life, so I do not recommend vitamin or mineral supplementation for healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Some people prefer to treat symptoms with dietary supplements, and there are a few supplements that may be effective. But it sounds like your wife is taking hers just to be healthier, and I don't think they are effective at doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It is unusual to get serious side effects from vitamins and minerals unless the doses are far above what is recommended. Still, she's probably wasting money on these supplements. Most of my patients I tell this to are reluctant to stop, as they have often been taking them for many years. Or they're convinced that the supplements are helpful, and it can be hard to change people's minds with new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I got the two doses of the shingles vaccine. Is this enough? Do I need the chickenpox one, too? I do not remember if I got chickenpox when I was young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— S.R.E.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear S.R.E.:&lt;/strong&gt; Two doses are all you need for the Shingrix vaccine, which is the vaccine given to people who have either had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine. This includes more than 95% of people over the age of 50, whom the shingles vaccine is designed for. It is not recommended to get the chickenpox vaccine or even test for immunity before getting the shingles vaccine.&lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Detroit News</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 05:07:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxNZm5vT1FqeXBaOEwtX1NRV2Yxc2ZyOXdvME1nN1BtblVoOThwRnBZWEVEUzFTVjhfTFdSazhmV3N3a2RYZXdpbnZxMVhjVXBMYkYtX3ljWjhaTjBSbEtGQVcwVzRIWkNucEhJa21FclhPLWstRUdwd0lQalVaLTg2cC0wbGNUQ09ncWliUUZ2bXFjdlQ2LWNVT3BMbl9VWXVqd3BLYXRST3VKQnR6ZHVYNGhvNGpDM08ycmtPZHhad0pnckNwYUNsU2xkTzhUS2hld3NNUg</guid></item><item><title>Losing Just One Night's Sleep Changes Your Immune System, Study Finds - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNNVk4TXJNeWR1MFdmeV9Ha1JHTjJqX1ZZWmtZdDRRd3E2WWczNGxSdlg5Vjl0ZExHQjNyUk40cGxScDhDOFdFbTJnTHhXTnY3aU4yelFST0JCUnI4U1ZnbWwtcUZ0UXQtVmFXSUFRdkVCU09URENfRHA4ZExidUh1VVo5dEVrN2lTUDBpUUFIcHN4NE9kX0lhTnZJNEw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We all know sleep is important, but it takes up so much time. With responsibilities and diversions still looming from our waking life, the urge to skimp on sleep can be powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet as a new study suggests, even a single night of sleep deprivation may cause significant upheaval in the immune system, potentially contributing to the development of conditions like obesity,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="153478" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-dangers-of-sleep-deprivation-are-very-real-expert-warns"&gt;perils of chronic sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt; are widely known, from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-how-a-lack-of-sleep-can-mess-with-your-emotions"&gt;mood changes&lt;/a&gt; and cognitive impairments to health problems like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/six-to-eight-hours-sleep-best-for-heart-cardiovascular-health"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is abundant evidence linking &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-an-important-reason-disturbed-sleep-makes-everything-hurt-more"&gt;poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; with these and other ailments, and abundant evidence suggesting health problems like these are commonly driven by chronic inflammation, the authors of the new study point out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is less evidence, however, about the specific mechanisms involved: How exactly could sleep deprivation lead to the systemic inflammation that goes on to impair people's health?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new study, researchers from the Dasman Diabetes Institute in Kuwait sought to understand the influence of sleep deprivation on circulating immune cells, such as monocytes, and its association with systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monocytes are large leukocytes, or white blood cells, that play key roles in the innate immune system, which provides the body's first line of defense against intruders. There are three subsets of monocytes in humans: classical, non-classical, and intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-classical monocytes patrol for pathogens in vasculature and extravascular tissues, the study's authors explain, using inflammatory cues to help them regulate the body's immune response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 276 healthy Kuwaiti adults with varying body mass indices (BMIs), 237 of whom ended up completing the study. They analyzed the subjects' sleep patterns, and monitored their blood for levels of different monocyte subsets as well as inflammation markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obese participants had significantly lower sleep quality than leaner participants, the study found, along with higher chronic low-grade inflammation. They also had more non-classical monocytes, which correlated with lower sleep quality and increased pro-inflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another part of the study, five healthy, lean adults submitted blood samples throughout a 24-hour period of sleep deprivation. These were compared to control blood samples taken after the participants had had a few days of refreshing sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even just 24 hours of sleep deprivation apparently altered the monocyte profiles in lean participants to resemble those of obese participants, a condition the researchers note is known to promote chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153551" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/working-late-on-computer.jpg" alt="person working late at computer" class="size-full wp-image-153551" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/working-late-on-computer.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/working-late-on-computer-600x361.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153551" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tillwe/2634026113/"&gt;Till Westermayer/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer may seem obvious – just get more sleep – but it's rarely that simple in real life. Modern civilization conspires to keep us up late, argues lead author Fatema Al-Rashed, a researcher at the Dasman Diabetes Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings underscore a growing public health challenge. Advancements in technology, prolonged screen time, and shifting societal norms are increasingly disruptive to regular sleeping hours," Al-Rashed &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074664"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This disruption in sleep has profound implications for immune health and overall well-being."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research should continue this examination of the links between sleep deprivation and immune changes, Al-Rashed and her colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jimmun/vkae016"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also hope to learn if any interventions might help mitigate this effect, such as structured sleep therapies or guidelines for limiting use of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the long term, we aim for this research to drive policies and strategies that recognize the critical role of sleep in public health," Al-Rashed &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074664"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We envision workplace reforms and educational campaigns promoting better sleep practices, particularly for populations at risk of sleep disruption due to technological and occupational demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, this could help mitigate the burden of inflammatory diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases," she &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074664"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jimmun/vkae016"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal of Immunology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A 3D-printed penis implant has restored erectile function to rabbits and pigs in a world first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigs with damage to their penile tissue that received the one-of-a-kind surgery not only achieved erections, their rates of successfully producing offspring increased from 25 percent to 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The penis has one of the most complex vascular network structures in the human body. For years now, researchers have been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590183424000127"&gt;working on a model&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_cavernosum_penis"&gt;corpus cavernosum&lt;/a&gt;, the spongy tissue of the penile shaft, that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reverse-erectile-dysfunction-in-pigs-using-synthetic-tissue"&gt;could help those with erectile defects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent study by a team from China, the US, and Japan presents a new physiological model that can reproduce erections in large, living animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create the model, researchers mimicked the corpus cavernosum through the creation of a hydrogel-based scaffolding – one that is strong enough to withstand the internal pressure when the structure fills with blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154200" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154200" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-642x231.png" alt="Biomimetic Penis" class="size-medium wp-image-154200" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-642x231.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-1024x369.png 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-768x277.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-600x216.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis.png 1294w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154200" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Images of the full biomimetic penis model with a (i) front view (ii), side view (iii), and partial section view.

Endothelial cells (ECs) can create an "&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10066672/"&gt;adaptable life-support system&lt;/a&gt;" in vessel-rich tissues, helping restore and improve function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this idea out in the corpus cavernosum of Bama pigs and New Zealand rabbits, researchers implanted the hydrogel and ECs into dozens of animals with erectile defects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some rabbits and pigs received the artificial penis implant &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; ECs, but those that received the ECs &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the implant showed better erectile function overall. In fact, their outcomes approached that of an animal without erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings indicate that the implants markedly improved functional recovery, and the combination with ECs further enhanced this effect, demonstrating notable improvements in tissue regeneration and functional recovery," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the authors, led by biological engineer Zhenxing Wang from South China University of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fertility of the EC groups demonstrates the recovery of erectile function and the ability to ejaculate, suggesting the restoration of the cavernous tissue in the treated males."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154212" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-642x311.png" alt="3D Printed Penis Repair" class="size-medium wp-image-154212" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-642x311.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-856x415.png 856w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-768x373.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-600x291.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects.png 1336w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154212" class="wp-caption-text"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="154179" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; images of 4 different rabbit groups: defect, implantation, ECs + implantation, and normal cavernosum (normal).

&lt;p&gt;When the pigs were allowed to breed a few weeks after surgery, pregnancy rates rose from just 25 percent in the defect group to 75 percent in the implant without ECs group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Male pigs that received the implant with ECs successfully impregnated every single female pig they mated with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154214" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-642x155.png" alt="3D Printed Penis Pigs" class="size-medium wp-image-154214" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-642x155.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-1024x247.png 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-768x185.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-1536x370.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-600x145.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis.png 1992w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154214" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Schematic diagram of the procedure for implanting the model into a defect made on the pig corpus cavernosum.

&lt;p&gt;It could also help inform the development of other artificial, vessel-rich organs, like the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Currently, developing transplant materials that support nerve regeneration and effectively integrate with the host's urethra and vascular networks presents a major challenge," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"These findings underscore the potential clinical applications of biomimetic corpus cavernosum for the treatment of penile injuries," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt; Wang and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Furthermore, this study advances the clinical application of 3D-printed artificial tissue organs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Maybe dogs who chew sticks are on to something. We don't necessarily have to chomp with a canine's zeal, but the basic concept – safely gnawing some hard, durable material – might be worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a new study, chewing on a hard substance like wood can boost levels of a naturally occurring antioxidant in the human brain, which in turn might improve a person's memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people chew gum, of course, which is softer but arguably more palatable than wood (and avoids tongue splinters). Previous research has shown chewing gum can, in fact, significantly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168010209000893?via%3Dihub"&gt;increase&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/154405910308200817"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt;, as the authors of the new study note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the brain's blood supply pumping seems to improve a variety of cognitive functions, it seems. Curiously, clinical evidence also suggests people who find chewing a challenge also tend to have lower cognitive function and higher mental impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear, though, what specific metabolic changes associated with cognition might occur following a boost in cerebral blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers investigated one possible explanation involving oxidative stress in neurological tissues, which is already believed to play a pivotal role in the decline of cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several metabolic processes produce harmful molecules known as reactive oxygen species, which can cause cumulative oxidative damage in the human brain. One of the brain's best defenses against oxidative stress is an antioxidant called glutathione (GSH), which holds many important jobs throughout the body, including protecting neurons from reactive oxygen species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping to shed light on the cognitive effects of chewing, the researchers designed the new study to explore the potential role of glutathione. Despite its importance in the brain, they note, the relationship between glutathione levels and mastication has drawn little attention until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They recruited 52 healthy university students from Daegu, South Korea, and divided them into two groups. One group of 27 subjects was given paraffin wax gum to chew; a second group of 25 was asked to chew on wooden medical tongue depressors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154198" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154198" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/dog-chewing-stick.jpg" alt="dog chewing on a stick" class="size-full wp-image-154198" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/dog-chewing-stick.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/dog-chewing-stick-600x370.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154198" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Maybe dogs are onto something. (&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/39908901@N06/6995110133/"&gt;m01229/Flickr/CC BY 2.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjects chewed their assigned substance for five minutes, while researchers used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure glutathione levels in their anterior cingulate cortex – a key brain region for cognitive control – before and after chewing. All subjects also took a cognitive test before and after the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chewing significantly boosted glutathione levels in subjects' anterior cingulate cortices, especially in the wood-chewing group compared with the gum-chewing group, the researchers report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined with results from the cognitive tests, the rise in glutathione concentration correlated positively with memory function. In other words, those who chewed wood and had larger glutathione boosts also performed better on the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that mastication can alter the level of antioxidants in the human brain, and that an increase in brain antioxidant levels is associated with cognitive function," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1489919"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research will still be needed to back up these findings, the study's authors add, with larger sample sizes, broader demographics, and assessment of different brain regions important focusses for subsequent studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While wood seemed to confer more benefit than paraffin wax gum, this study also only tested two substances being chewed for five minutes. Future research might also investigate a wider range of materials and chewing durations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings alone may not be sufficient evidence to recommend chewing wood for better memory, but they do provide a compelling hint. And it would be good news if chewing wood does have this effect, the researchers write, given the challenge of managing glutathione levels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since there are currently no drugs or established practices for boosting brain GSH levels, our findings suggest that chewing moderately hard material could serve as an effective practice for increasing GSH levels in the brain," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1489919"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1489919/full"&gt;Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Ainslee Sirten said that it started a little less than two weeks ago, near the end of February, when her mom, Dri Marquez, texted her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She texted me on Sunday and said that everybody was really sick," said Sirten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That included Marquez's partner of almost 10 years, Danny Moore. The next day, Sirten said that they called her a little after 1 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She said that Danny just fell unconscious, and they had to call paramedics and start CPR on him," said Sirten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that paramedics couldn't resuscitate him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was nothing they could do; his kidneys failed, and that's a complication of the flu, we guess," said Sirten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sirten said that Moore was just 38 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were no terribly awful health conditions that he had for him to pass of kidney failure or complications of the flu. So, [that was] unbelievable to me," said Sirten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She spoke about Moore's impact on her mom and her 8-year-old brother Finn, who is Moore's son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He fit right in when he started dating mom. That was so awesome for her to have someone who she just clicked with," said Sirten. "He was hilarious. He was such a good dad to Finn. They were best buddies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Moore passed away, both Marquez and Finn also ended up in the hospital with the flu. Sirten said that her brother is back home, but her mom is still fighting for her life. She said that her mom received a liver transplant almost three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She is immunocompromised, and they said that as far as sickness goes, it didn't help her case at all. She developed pneumonia in the hospital," said Sirten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors said that hospitals are still pretty full as flu activity remains very high throughout the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are some times in individuals, and they may not even have extra medical comorbidities, where the flu triggers a really serious illness," said Dr. Stephen Feagins, Hamilton County Public Health Medical Director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Sirten, she is thankful for the support of others during this tough time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're just trying to keep our family unit close, make sure that we have people we can turn to," said Sirten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sirten said that her mom is on a ventilator and receiving dialysis at UC Medical Center as she continues to recover.

    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmkc5p002s26pbchgj8qis@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Texas this week to aid in the response to a growing measles outbreak, and US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pledged that they would talk to “front-line doctors and see what is working on the ground” and learn about therapeutics “ignored” by the agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xnamtm00063b6m9x7fx8p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a highly effective vaccine that prevents measles but no specific antiviral to treat it. Kennedy has previously pushed the use of vitamin A, and in an interview with Fox News this week, he endorsed an unconventional treatment regimen for measles including a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpgsgd000h3b6m7s8ho1z1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the interview, which was posted in full on Fox Nation,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kennedy praised two West Texas doctors who he said were using this remedy on their patients and had seen “almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery.” He said these doctors had “treated most of the patients”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the current outbreak, which has now reached 159 reported cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wrbh2400062e6cnep5jf09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the doctors Kennedy is apparently taking cues from has troubled history. He was disciplined by the Texas Medical Board in 2003 for “unusual use of risk-filled medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000a2e6cuqb0f8ql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy said HHS would do a clinical trial on the steroid budesonide, the antibiotic clarithromycin and cod liver oil therapies and said “we recommend to local physicians that they consider vitamin A and their protocols. He also suggested that vitamin A may work “as a prophylaxis,” although doctors say it does not prevent measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000b2e6cfvwktkme@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;says measles vaccination&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which can prevent most cases, is a personal choice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000c2e6cwtm9usqp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At this point, we are recommending that people in those [undervaccinated]&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;communities get vaccines. We understand a lot of them will not, and we’re going to try to make sure that they’re taken care of through the best therapeutic interventions that we can provide them or recommend for them,” Kennedy said in the Fox interview.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv0hws00002e6cx76souke@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the doctors Kennedy praised, Dr. Richard Bartlett, has a history of using unconventional treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv6nxi000s2e6cndkfdev4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett faced &lt;a href="https://profile.tmb.state.tx.us/BoardActions.aspx?5c10c894-afcc-4791-8e3c-e81b0b7998ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;disciplinary action&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Medical Board more than two decades ago for “unusual” prescribing of antibiotics and steroids in five patients, including two children. None of the patients had measles; they came in with a variety of complaints including diabetes, back and neck pain, sinus pressure, inflamed tonsils and other cold symptoms, obesity and uncontrollable hunger, according to the medical board’s investigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at200062e6cjuti606p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After reviewing the patients’ medical records, the board  found that Bartlett misdiagnosed their symptoms and mismanaged their  care, ordering unnecessary tests and treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at300072e6ctwybg8wq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a 2003 order, the board cited Bartlett for  inappropriately using medications such as powerful IV antibiotics and  “multi-day doses” of long-acting steroids “without any documentation in  the records of the weighing of risk versus benefits of this care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at300092e6c4h391al9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the  medical board’s disciplinary action, or on the basis of his use of  steroids and antibiotics for the treatment of measles in West Texas.

            The&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;board’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;final order  stated that the “respondent maintains that he treated the patients  appropriately, with no adverse outcomes, considering that he was  providing care to a relatively underserved area with limited resources  and medical support.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Bartlett was cleared to return to practice without supervision&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in  2005 after adhering to the board’s requests, such as completing  additional medical education and having another doctor chosen by the  medical board monitor him for at least a year. He also indicated that he  would modify his practice accordingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000c2e6cbkua19ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the pandemic, Bartlett said he treated Covid-19 patients with what he called his&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newswest9.com/article/news/local/local-doctor-believes-he-has-found-silver-bullet-for-covid-19/513-8cd065d2-dbb5-4814-9cdd-5bb0dae77703" target="_blank"&gt;silver bullet&lt;/a&gt;: an experimental combination of budesonide, which is a steroid; the antibiotic clarithromycin; and aspirin. Bartlett often talked about the treatment on podcasts and in interviews, including some widely shared on social media. An independent fact-checking group &lt;a href="https://science.feedback.org/review/no-evidence-budesonide-clarithromycin-aspirin-combination-silver-bullet-treatment-covid-contrary-texas-doctors-claim/" target="_blank"&gt;found that his claims&lt;/a&gt; about the therapy were unsupported by scientific evidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xxumb600003b6meeeztgx7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both measles and Covid are caused by viruses. Antibiotics, which kill bacteria, are powerless against viral infections. Medical experts say antibiotics can sometimes be helpful if a viral infection causes a secondary bacterial infection, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. But they’re not appropriate or helpful in every case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xy2du600023b6mah5eqk5x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Steroids have been tried in people with measles who develop a very rare complication that leads to brain swelling, but using them in milder cases may be harmful because they dampen the body’s immune response just when it is needed to fight the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000g2e6cdoeuhaz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no specific treatment for measles. In severe cases, doctors may offer treatments such as supplemental oxygen and fluids to help patients get through the worst of their illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xy2i4p00053b6mvl4sgoua@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Lara Johnson, Covenant Health’s chief medical officer, said its Lubbock, Texas, hospital has treated more than 20 patients and that hospital physicians have followed recommended treatment protocol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000h2e6cd4znip1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends two doses of physician-administered vitamin A in cases of severe measles, such as people who are hospitalized. Infectious disease experts also recommend vitamin A in these cases, but they note that the vitamin is most useful in impoverished countries where children are significantly malnourished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000i2e6c4kz9lcrg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The HHS secretary said the people in West Texas who were getting sick, including a school-age child who died last week, may have had malnutrition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000j2e6c8ma0gqso@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s very, very difficult … for measles to kill a healthy person,” Kennedy said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000k2e6cf2lnc7m1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;state health department&lt;/a&gt; reported that the child who died had no underlying conditions, and local doctors disagree with the secretary’s assessment of the population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000l2e6cyj7hmk6d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our children are actually very well nourished. [That’s]  another concerning comment, because I think it makes people have a false  sense of, ‘Well, my kid is well nourished, so they’re not going to get  this,’” said Dr. Leslie Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, where the  outbreak is growing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000m2e6c01cn4ikw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Whether you have underlying medical problems or you are  healthy, measles can be detrimental. It’s the kind of virus that doesn’t  really discriminate.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000n2e6cxdatyv4v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy claimed in the Fox interview to have seen “studies  that show [vitamin A] is good for prophylaxis,” but medical experts say  it has no use for measles prevention. High doses can even be toxic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000o2e6c50a1zuff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s not evidence that vitamin A has any preventative benefits,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital. “The worry is that it’s being weaponized by the health and wellness industry.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000p2e6cz16qiott@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The only way to prevent measles is to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000q2e6cdkrxspm2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy is “talking about treatment for children with or anyone with measles, treatment of people with measles that can be prevented by vaccines,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “Vaccines actually prevent people from getting measles, so you don’t need to treat them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wrkcx0000d2e6cnrxpdjll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s soft sell of the measles vaccine amid an outbreak has stunned public health experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ws9jcj000n2e6ccultebiq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles. Immunity from the shot is long-lasting, too. When the vaccine is used by enough people within a community, measles has nowhere to spread. It can be eliminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv17ix00042e6cqg913c2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say Kennedy’s emphasis on treatments has muddled the message.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xq4rz4000p3b6mk9vcw5lb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrGiroir/status/1896353987093246011" target="_blank"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, a pediatrician and former US assistant secretary for health during the first Trump administration, thanked Kennedy for “emphasizing the critical importance” of the measles vaccine. “But please do not rely on #VitaminA to save your child in the US - helps in Africa where there is a deficiency-not here. I have both treated and buried children with measles,” he wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsa9zw000q2e6c8va8tapm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Kennedy’s interview on Fox, the HHS secretary was also eager to talk about vaccine injuries and risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsdabj000t2e6cq7dibsk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The CDC, in the past, has not done a good job at quantifying the risk of vaccines,” Kennedy said. “We are going to do that now so that people can make a real, informed choice about what’s best for them, for their families and their communities.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsipec000w2e6c4m87d1et@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts said that hearing this from the nation’s top public health official was distressing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wt8uxe001l2e6chmq0bgzl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He didn’t talk about the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccines, then pivoted to vitamin A and talking about how it was sanitation improvements that are bringing down measles rates in the US, and all this other kind of nonsense, and you just don’t do that kind of stuff in the middle of an epidemic,” Hotez said. “It was really disheartening to see that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wtd1ix001o2e6cyvn2vi1m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Others echoed that sentiment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000o2e6clzemqalo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If it were someone on the sidelines kind of calling this out, I guess it would be less surprising, but to have the secretary of Health and Human Services, who is really responsible for the public’s health to tout this misguided treatment regimen for measles and downplay the role of vaccines and preventing measles,” Moss said. “It’s mind-blowing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xc1zua00092e6cun50djvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS said it would review a detailed list of CNN’s questions about Kennedy’s statements in the interview posted on Fox Nation but did not respond with answers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7xo2fls000d3b6mx8s93shb@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="understanding-infectious-disease" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Understanding infectious disease
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00112e6cim844a5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy made other misstatements in the Fox interview that downplayed infectious diseases and their effects, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xna7ln00033b6mbmoemelp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He suggested that bird flu has long been a threat, saying it has “been around for 100 years,” although H5N1 was identified in 1996 in China. It’s not clear whether Kennedy was referring to other flu types that could be carried by birds, a natural reservoir for the viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhdzsc00003b6mqw0v4gj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy further said that about 70 people are known to have gotten sick with bird flu, and “almost all of them were involved in culling operations.” In fact, more dairy workers have caught the virus than people involved in the culling or depopulating of birds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00122e6cqpn7eb1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said the bird flu strain that originally spread in cattle during the ongoing outbreak, B3.13, “is not very dangerous to humans” because people who have caught it have not been very sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00132e6cwogzdy8m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says that statement demonstrates that Kennedy doesn’t understand the threat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00142e6chlzyxdn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unfortunately, we don’t have the luxury of not being afraid of these viruses,” Osterholm said. “We have to take all of them very seriously as a potential cause of the next influenza pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00152e6c8v2k4kp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As long as they’re circulating as they are, that just gives each one of these viruses unlimited shots at the genetic roulette table,” he added. The more people they infect, in other words, the more chances they have to change and become more efficient human pathogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001c2e6c2mf4jx73@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy maintained his message that he would tackle chronic disease and “get the really bad stuff out of the food as quickly as possible.” He questioned why the US had the “highest death rate on the planet” from Covid: Was it the infection itself or actually underlying disease in the population at large?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001e2e6cz4g2ul1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Was it really Covid that was there killing them? Or was it that they were so sick that they were hanging off the cliff and Covid just came and stomped on their fingernails?” he asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001f2e6c96gesrp6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you are healthy, it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease,” Kennedy said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xj0yyx00002e6cb0654evm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say this typical of Kennedy’s communication: He starts with a kernel of truth, but his conclusions on an issue are often incorrect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpimxw000k3b6mrnzjws7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy is right that people with underlying health conditions are more likely to get sicker when they get an infectious disease. But it’s not true that people who are in good health are impervious to viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpi87f00032e6ctsf3lox5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He’s saying some truth, right? He’s saying things that are wrong, but there’s some truth to it,” said Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert and distinguished professor of medicine at Emory University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpx3e8000b2e6czy5syvtf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is an infection that can make even healthy children very sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xprk1t00062e6c1xq1cx39@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I really want to plead to mothers to vaccinate their kids,” del Rio said. “That is a highly effective strategy. In this country, in 2025, we should not see measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            A team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Texas this week to aid in the response to a growing measles outbreak, and US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pledged that they would talk to “front-line doctors and see what is working on the ground” and learn about therapeutics “ignored” by the agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xnamtm00063b6m9x7fx8p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a highly effective vaccine that prevents measles but no specific antiviral to treat it. Kennedy has previously pushed the use of vitamin A, and in an interview with Fox News this week, he endorsed an unconventional treatment regimen for measles including a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpgsgd000h3b6m7s8ho1z1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the interview, which was posted in full on Fox Nation,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kennedy praised two West Texas doctors who he said were using this remedy on their patients and had seen “almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery.” He said these doctors had “treated most of the patients”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the current outbreak, which has now reached 159 reported cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wrbh2400062e6cnep5jf09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the doctors Kennedy is apparently taking cues from has troubled history. He was disciplined by the Texas Medical Board in 2003 for “unusual use of risk-filled medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000a2e6cuqb0f8ql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy said HHS would do a clinical trial on the steroid budesonide, the antibiotic clarithromycin and cod liver oil therapies and said “we recommend to local physicians that they consider vitamin A and their protocols. He also suggested that vitamin A may work “as a prophylaxis,” although doctors say it does not prevent measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000b2e6cfvwktkme@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;says measles vaccination&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which can prevent most cases, is a personal choice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000c2e6cwtm9usqp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At this point, we are recommending that people in those [undervaccinated]&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;communities get vaccines. We understand a lot of them will not, and we’re going to try to make sure that they’re taken care of through the best therapeutic interventions that we can provide them or recommend for them,” Kennedy said in the Fox interview.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv0hws00002e6cx76souke@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the doctors Kennedy praised, Dr. Richard Bartlett, has a history of using unconventional treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv6nxi000s2e6cndkfdev4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett faced &lt;a href="https://profile.tmb.state.tx.us/BoardActions.aspx?5c10c894-afcc-4791-8e3c-e81b0b7998ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;disciplinary action&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Medical Board more than two decades ago for “unusual” prescribing of antibiotics and steroids in five patients, including two children. None of the patients had measles; they came in with a variety of complaints including diabetes, back and neck pain, sinus pressure, inflamed tonsils and other cold symptoms, obesity and uncontrollable hunger, according to the medical board’s investigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at200062e6cjuti606p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After reviewing the patients’ medical records, the board  found that Bartlett misdiagnosed their symptoms and mismanaged their  care, ordering unnecessary tests and treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at300072e6ctwybg8wq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a 2003 order, the board cited Bartlett for  inappropriately using medications such as powerful IV antibiotics and  “multi-day doses” of long-acting steroids “without any documentation in  the records of the weighing of risk versus benefits of this care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at300092e6c4h391al9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the  medical board’s disciplinary action, or on the basis of his use of  steroids and antibiotics for the treatment of measles in West Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000a2e6cdxrbzlls@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;board’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;final order  stated that the “respondent maintains that he treated the patients  appropriately, with no adverse outcomes, considering that he was  providing care to a relatively underserved area with limited resources  and medical support.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000b2e6cl4ok9kif@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett was cleared to return to practice without supervision&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in  2005 after adhering to the board’s requests, such as completing  additional medical education and having another doctor chosen by the  medical board monitor him for at least a year. He also indicated that he  would modify his practice accordingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000c2e6cbkua19ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the pandemic, Bartlett said he treated Covid-19 patients with what he called his&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newswest9.com/article/news/local/local-doctor-believes-he-has-found-silver-bullet-for-covid-19/513-8cd065d2-dbb5-4814-9cdd-5bb0dae77703" target="_blank"&gt;silver bullet&lt;/a&gt;: an experimental combination of budesonide, which is a steroid; the antibiotic clarithromycin; and aspirin. Bartlett often talked about the treatment on podcasts and in interviews, including some widely shared on social media. An independent fact-checking group &lt;a href="https://science.feedback.org/review/no-evidence-budesonide-clarithromycin-aspirin-combination-silver-bullet-treatment-covid-contrary-texas-doctors-claim/" target="_blank"&gt;found that his claims&lt;/a&gt; about the therapy were unsupported by scientific evidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xxumb600003b6meeeztgx7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both measles and Covid are caused by viruses. Antibiotics, which kill bacteria, are powerless against viral infections. Medical experts say antibiotics can sometimes be helpful if a viral infection causes a secondary bacterial infection, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. But they’re not appropriate or helpful in every case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xy2du600023b6mah5eqk5x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Steroids have been tried in people with measles who develop a very rare complication that leads to brain swelling, but using them in milder cases may be harmful because they dampen the body’s immune response just when it is needed to fight the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000g2e6cdoeuhaz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no specific treatment for measles. In severe cases, doctors may offer treatments such as supplemental oxygen and fluids to help patients get through the worst of their illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xy2i4p00053b6mvl4sgoua@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Lara Johnson, Covenant Health’s chief medical officer, said its Lubbock, Texas, hospital has treated more than 20 patients and that hospital physicians have followed recommended treatment protocol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000h2e6cd4znip1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends two doses of physician-administered vitamin A in cases of severe measles, such as people who are hospitalized. Infectious disease experts also recommend vitamin A in these cases, but they note that the vitamin is most useful in impoverished countries where children are significantly malnourished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000i2e6c4kz9lcrg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The HHS secretary said the people in West Texas who were getting sick, including a school-age child who died last week, may have had malnutrition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000j2e6c8ma0gqso@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s very, very difficult … for measles to kill a healthy person,” Kennedy said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000k2e6cf2lnc7m1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;state health department&lt;/a&gt; reported that the child who died had no underlying conditions, and local doctors disagree with the secretary’s assessment of the population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000l2e6cyj7hmk6d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our children are actually very well nourished. [That’s]  another concerning comment, because I think it makes people have a false  sense of, ‘Well, my kid is well nourished, so they’re not going to get  this,’” said Dr. Leslie Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, where the  outbreak is growing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000m2e6c01cn4ikw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Whether you have underlying medical problems or you are  healthy, measles can be detrimental. It’s the kind of virus that doesn’t  really discriminate.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000n2e6cxdatyv4v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy claimed in the Fox interview to have seen “studies  that show [vitamin A] is good for prophylaxis,” but medical experts say  it has no use for measles prevention. High doses can even be toxic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000o2e6c50a1zuff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s not evidence that vitamin A has any preventative benefits,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital. “The worry is that it’s being weaponized by the health and wellness industry.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000p2e6cz16qiott@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The only way to prevent measles is to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000q2e6cdkrxspm2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy is “talking about treatment for children with or anyone with measles, treatment of people with measles that can be prevented by vaccines,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “Vaccines actually prevent people from getting measles, so you don’t need to treat them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wrkcx0000d2e6cnrxpdjll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s soft sell of the measles vaccine amid an outbreak has stunned public health experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ws9jcj000n2e6ccultebiq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles. Immunity from the shot is long-lasting, too. When the vaccine is used by enough people within a community, measles has nowhere to spread. It can be eliminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv17ix00042e6cqg913c2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say Kennedy’s emphasis on treatments has muddled the message.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xq4rz4000p3b6mk9vcw5lb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrGiroir/status/1896353987093246011" target="_blank"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, a pediatrician and former US assistant secretary for health during the first Trump administration, thanked Kennedy for “emphasizing the critical importance” of the measles vaccine. “But please do not rely on #VitaminA to save your child in the US - helps in Africa where there is a deficiency-not here. I have both treated and buried children with measles,” he wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsa9zw000q2e6c8va8tapm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Kennedy’s interview on Fox, the HHS secretary was also eager to talk about vaccine injuries and risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsdabj000t2e6cq7dibsk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The CDC, in the past, has not done a good job at quantifying the risk of vaccines,” Kennedy said. “We are going to do that now so that people can make a real, informed choice about what’s best for them, for their families and their communities.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsipec000w2e6c4m87d1et@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts said that hearing this from the nation’s top public health official was distressing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wt8uxe001l2e6chmq0bgzl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He didn’t talk about the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccines, then pivoted to vitamin A and talking about how it was sanitation improvements that are bringing down measles rates in the US, and all this other kind of nonsense, and you just don’t do that kind of stuff in the middle of an epidemic,” Hotez said. “It was really disheartening to see that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wtd1ix001o2e6cyvn2vi1m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Others echoed that sentiment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000o2e6clzemqalo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If it were someone on the sidelines kind of calling this out, I guess it would be less surprising, but to have the secretary of Health and Human Services, who is really responsible for the public’s health to tout this misguided treatment regimen for measles and downplay the role of vaccines and preventing measles,” Moss said. “It’s mind-blowing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xc1zua00092e6cun50djvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS said it would review a detailed list of CNN’s questions about Kennedy’s statements in the interview posted on Fox Nation but did not respond with answers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7xo2fls000d3b6mx8s93shb@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="understanding-infectious-disease" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Understanding infectious disease
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00112e6cim844a5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy made other misstatements in the Fox interview that downplayed infectious diseases and their effects, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xna7ln00033b6mbmoemelp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He suggested that bird flu has long been a threat, saying it has “been around for 100 years,” although H5N1 was identified in 1996 in China. It’s not clear whether Kennedy was referring to other flu types that could be carried by birds, a natural reservoir for the viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhdzsc00003b6mqw0v4gj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy further said that about 70 people are known to have gotten sick with bird flu, and “almost all of them were involved in culling operations.” In fact, more dairy workers have caught the virus than people involved in the culling or depopulating of birds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00122e6cqpn7eb1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said the bird flu strain that originally spread in cattle during the ongoing outbreak, B3.13, “is not very dangerous to humans” because people who have caught it have not been very sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00132e6cwogzdy8m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says that statement demonstrates that Kennedy doesn’t understand the threat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00142e6chlzyxdn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unfortunately, we don’t have the luxury of not being afraid of these viruses,” Osterholm said. “We have to take all of them very seriously as a potential cause of the next influenza pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00152e6c8v2k4kp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As long as they’re circulating as they are, that just gives each one of these viruses unlimited shots at the genetic roulette table,” he added. The more people they infect, in other words, the more chances they have to change and become more efficient human pathogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001c2e6c2mf4jx73@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy maintained his message that he would tackle chronic disease and “get the really bad stuff out of the food as quickly as possible.” He questioned why the US had the “highest death rate on the planet” from Covid: Was it the infection itself or actually underlying disease in the population at large?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001e2e6cz4g2ul1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Was it really Covid that was there killing them? Or was it that they were so sick that they were hanging off the cliff and Covid just came and stomped on their fingernails?” he asked.

            “If you are healthy, it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease,” Kennedy said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Experts say this typical of Kennedy’s communication: He starts with a kernel of truth, but his conclusions on an issue are often incorrect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Kennedy is right that people with underlying health conditions are more likely to get sicker when they get an infectious disease. But it’s not true that people who are in good health are impervious to viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “He’s saying some truth, right? He’s saying things that are wrong, but there’s some truth to it,” said Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert and distinguished professor of medicine at Emory University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Measles is an infection that can make even healthy children very sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I really want to plead to mothers to vaccinate their kids,” del Rio said. “That is a highly effective strategy. In this country, in 2025, we should not see measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

The experiment involved mice born to live fast and die young, bred with a rodent version of progeria, a condition that causes premature aging. Left alone, the animals grow gray and frail and then die about seven months later, compared with a lifespan of about two years for typical lab mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OELJRTUCDZEH7ASSNEXANH5MGI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the Salk scientists had a plan to change the aging animals’ fate. They injected them with a virus carrying four genes that can reshape DNA and, in effect, make every cell in the rodents’ bodies young again. The scientists could even control the genes from outside the mice, turning them on and off to manage the safety and potency of the genetic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DIBJOPWA5RHOZOFC234Y2ISHAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The experiment worked: The animals lived 30 percent longer afterward, a marked improvement, if not quite a normal mouse lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="57RMNYHIJ5BTFC4LHW4WHUR52U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Read &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/06/cellular-reprogramming-longevity-reverse-aging/" target="_blank"&gt;more here&lt;/a&gt; about how cellular reprogramming works and whether it can improve human health spans and lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="26SE3TNP5ZBCXNS2P3IL4Z4QSI" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="26SE3TNP5ZBCXNS2P3IL4Z4QSI"&gt;Paxlovid may not reduce hospitalization risk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GSUDONFGGFAFTMNMV33YCVEUEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re an older adult between the ages of 65 and 74, you may want to read our story about the antiviral medication for covid, Paxlovid.

You have heard of cholesterol, and you may even know what your cholesterol level is. The compound lipoprotein a may be equally dangerous when it is elevated, but you have probably heard very little about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could listen through your local public radio station or get the live stream at 7 am EDT on your computer or smart phone (&lt;a href="https://www.wunc.org"&gt;wunc.org&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/find-a-radio-station"&gt;Here is a link&lt;/a&gt; so you can find which stations carry our broadcast. If you can’t listen to the broadcast, you may wish to hear the podcast later. You can subscribe through your favorite podcast provider, download the mp3 using the link at the bottom of the page, or listen to the stream on this post starting on March 10, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Is Lp(a)?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipoprotein a, or L-P-little a for short, circulates in the bloodstream, where it picks up and carries cholesterol and oxidized phospholipids. Scientists believe that blood levels are determined mostly by genetics and change very little over the course of our lives. Roughly 20 percent of people have high levels of Lp(a), above 30 ng/dL or 75 nmol/L. The two different figures are because tests use different units to measure the blood concentration, either nanograms per deciliter or nanomols per liter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we don’t know if Lp(a) has or perhaps once had some important functions, we do know that elevated levels of this chemical is associated with heart disease. People with higher levels are more likely to suffer blood clots and inflammation. That puts them at risk for heart attacks or even strokes. So why hasn’t your doctor ordered a blood test to learn your level?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is Lp(a) the Heart Risk Doctors Can’t Treat?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps doctors have been reluctant to measure or discuss lipoprotein a because they don’t have good interventions. That is beginning to change with the development of antisense oligonucleotides, a new category of prescription drugs that can cut levels sharply. The FDA has not yet approved any of these new medications, though. The first of these, pelacarsen, is still in Phase 3 trials needed before the agency can consider the evidence. However, it can bring down lipoprotein a by an estimated 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists’ favorite drugs, statins, do not help Lp(a) levels. In fact, Lp(a) the heart risk rises when people are taking statins to lower their cholesterol. Other cholesterol-lowering drugs such as evolocumab (&lt;strong&gt;Repatha&lt;/strong&gt;) and alirocumab (&lt;strong&gt;Praluent&lt;/strong&gt;) can bring Lp(a) levels down modestly. One really old cholesterol-lowering drug, high-dose niacin, also helps moderate Lp(a). Some people do not tolerate it, however, as it can cause very uncomfortable flushing. So far as we know, no scientists have run studies to see whether niacin reduces the risk of heart attacks and other complications because of its effects on Lp(a).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Other Complications of Lp(a):&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our guest, Dr. Sam Tsimikas, is among the country’s leading experts on lipoprotein a. We asked him whether Lp(a) the heart risk factor causes other problems as well. Dr. Tsimikas described heart failure, potentially resulting from a heart attack, as well as peripheral artery disease (PAD), which can make it painful to walk. Lp(a) seems to cause plaque in arteries throughout the body. As a result, it can increase the chance of a stroke. In addition, it contributes to calcification of the heart valves. This condition interferes with their ability to function properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Can We Do If Lp(a) Is Too High?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tsimikas runs a unique clinic for cardiology patients with high levels of Lp(a). We asked him how he helps them. One approach is to collect additional information about their level of risk. A coronary calcium score can be a useful indicator. If it is high, he and his patients work to control all the potential risk factors that they can. He discusses the potential benefit of aspirin with them. Because Lp(a) the heart risk factor increases the chance of dangerous blood clots, the anti-clotting activity of aspirin can sometimes be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering dietary advice can be tricky if a patient has high cholesterol as well as elevated Lp(a), since the ideal diets for each are nearly opposite each other. A ketogenic diet tends to raise LDL cholesterol, for example, while it may modestly lower Lp(a). We think by the end of this episode, you’ll join us in hoping that scientists can learn a lot more about Lp(a) in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;This Week’s Guest:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sotirios (Sam) Tsimikas, MD, FACC, FAHA, FSCAI, is Professor of Medicine/Cardiology and Director of Vascular Medicine at the Sulpizio Cardiovascular Center.
