New routines don’t stick overnight. A classic study found that it takes &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674" target="_blank"&gt;on average 66 days&lt;/a&gt; of practicing a new dietary or physical behavior each day before it becomes a habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SM6CNLN4QZG3RPYKYVNAML5SCY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You need to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15702599/" target="_blank"&gt;make it easy&lt;/a&gt; to make it last. So choose one habit and list every barrier that will keep you from hitting the mark. Then pre-solve each one. Is it too cold to go for a jog early in the morning? Find a 30-minute cardio routine on YouTube that you can do in your bedroom. Don’t have time to cook veggies from scratch? Frozen vegetables can save you time and money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 10:09:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5EcDJQMHFtUmlwX3NnVXdJYzRnYVltR1I3SUlGWFBKV3l6OWttX1l6QmMwcFFOcFpwQ1RoSHE1akpPbW1MbUxlcVR2S2dKbkwtWXBZRkVwdGlQYlZ1RVpvMk5uTkxqc3hhUWJkWWYzTEkySTBucnM1eEJERFg</guid></item><item><title>研究重启了有关癌症患者不受欢迎的饮食的争论- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/22/cancer-neutropenic-diet-lessened-risk-of-infection/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oncologists have been moving away from the notoriously unpopular neutropenic diet. It requires nearly all food to be cooked to high temperatures — or, as some have described it, “boiled to death” — to reduce the risk of food-borne illnesses. But since evidence in recent years suggested the diet didn’t actually help ward off infections, doctors started leaning away from a strict neutropenic diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study published last week in the&lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO-25-00889#abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Journal of Clinical Oncology&lt;/a&gt; is giving some physicians pause about fresh fruits and vegetables for patients whose treatment involves heavy suppression of the immune system, particularly neutrophils, white blood cells that are key to preventing infection. Contrary to research in the past, the trial found that certain blood cancer patients who were allowed a less restrictive or liberalized diet had 11% more infections than patients who were prescribed the neutropenic diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There has been a move in the last 10 years in liberalizing diets for patients, for sure,” said Talal Hilal, a hematologist oncologist and bone marrow transplant physician at the Mayo Clinic who did not work on the study. But reading the paper, Hilal said, “it does pose the question of maybe we need to revisit how liberal we want to be with our patients.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oncologists first began using the neutropenic diet decades ago, particularly for intensively treated cancer patients like those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell or bone marrow transplants. These procedures can give certain blood cancer patients an opportunity for a cure, but sometimes use heavy doses of chemotherapy that’s extremely harsh on the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the weakened immune system is recovering after the procedure, infections have a higher potential of turning deadly, until the patient’s cell counts recover. Hospitals have been known to go to great lengths to protect these patients including&lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO-24-02046" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; preventing outside food or fresh flowers&lt;/a&gt; from entering their rooms. As cruel as it may have felt, clinicians assured themselves it was better than potentially introducing dangerous bacteria, viruses, or fungal spores to the defenseless.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Over the years, though, evidence suggested that normal diets don’t pose much of an infection risk. Rather, neutropenic diets were&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3228185/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; blamed&lt;/a&gt; for decreasing patient quality of life and increasing malnutrition. So hospitals have gradually shifted toward being more liberal when it comes to neutropenic patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In particular, a group at the University of Milan published the first &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/12/10/bone-marrow-transplant-patients-neutropenic-diet/"&gt;randomized evidence&lt;/a&gt; that a non-restrictive diet was not inferior to the neutropenic diet for certain stem cell transplant patients in 2023, leading many oncologists to rejoice that the benefits of the neutropenic diet were finally debunked. They also showed a non-restrictive diet improved quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But John Wingard, a hematologist-oncologist and emeritus faculty at the University of Florida, wanted to take another look. In particular, he wanted to know if un-restricting the diet for neutropenic patients would actually improve patients’ nutrition, an ongoing challenge for many cancer patients undergoing intensive therapy. Like the Milan group, Wingard enrolled over 200 blood cancer patients and randomized them to get either a liberalized diet allowing fresh fruits, vegetables, and pasteurized yogurt, or the neutropenic diet. In this study, patients were allowed to eat home-cooked or restaurant food as long as it adhered to diet guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wingard planned to look at how many clinically confirmed infections were in each group at different time periods. “We had to prematurely stop the trial from data safety monitoring committee because the liberalized diet had 11% more infections,” Wingard said. Only about half of the patients who were allowed the liberalized diet actually consumed fresh fruits or vegetables, Wingard added. “When we did an analysis of just the people who complied with the liberalized diet, the rate of infection was 1.5 times higher.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also suggested that allowing the liberalized diet didn’t seem to improve patients’ nutrition or quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taken together, Mayo Clinic’s Hilal said he’s starting to rethink his practice of being more permissive with transplant patients’ diets. “I feel like if you are liberalizing diet and you’re not even seeing improvements in quality of life or nutritional status, then there is no trade-off here. Why would I be very easy with liberalizing my diet, if I don’t benefit in any other domain?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are some caveats, Hilal said. For one, the patient population in both the 2023 Milan group study and this study are different. The 2023 paper was a multi-center study, which can help remove hospital-specific biases. It was also done in Europe, where certain practices may be different than what’s typical in the U.S., which could plausibly make comparison harder as well. “They are also a higher-risk population that seems to be enrolled in this JCO paper,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Hilal said he felt the study may reignite a debate on the neutropenic diet, and cancer researchers might argue over the strengths and weaknesses of both trials. “It’ll probably get discussed. People will take sides,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, Hilal and other physicians, including Wingard, said that it’s likely still reasonable to allow a non-restrictive diet with other patients like solid tumor patients who may still be neutropenic, but not as high risk or neutropenic for as long as bone marrow transplant patients. This study also showed that being neutropenic longer was the main variable associated with infection. No patients died during the study intervention either, and oncologists can manage many infections well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for why neither diet improved nutrition or quality of life for patients, Wingard thinks that might be because intensive cancer treatment can leave patients nauseous, without an appetite, and generally uncomfortable. No matter what food they get, some patients will just struggle to eat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think the neutropenic diet is that bad,” Wingard said. “It’s just that patients who have been treated this way have a symptom called dysgeusia, which means everything tastes bad. And then you have nausea and stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Probably the best way to settle the neutropenic diet debate and help patients’ quality of life and nutrition, Wingard said, is to focus on improving treatment. New effective therapies that are less toxic to the immune system would mean there’s no need for something like the neutropenic diet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Heart disease is the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db521.htm"&gt;leading cause of death in the United States&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since researchers first established the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14364826/"&gt;link between diet, cholesterol and heart disease in the 1950s&lt;/a&gt;, risk for heart disease has been partly assessed based on a patient's cholesterol levels, which can be routinely measured via blood work at the doctor's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.CIR.97.20.2007"&gt;accumulating evidence over the past two decades&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates that a biomarker called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/23056-c-reactive-protein-crp-test"&gt;C-reactive protein&lt;/a&gt; – which signals the presence of low-grade inflammation – is a better predictor of risk for heart disease than cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-finds-inflammation-could-be-a-core-feature-of-depression"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poor-oral-hygiene-could-be-taking-a-toll-on-your-heart-expert-says"&gt;Poor Oral Hygiene Could Be Taking a Toll on Your Heart, Expert Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, in September 2025, the American College of Cardiology published &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.08.047"&gt;new recommendations for universal screening of&lt;/a&gt; C-reactive protein levels in all patients, alongside measuring cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186417" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186417" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/GlowyGoldLiverInBlueTorsoOutline.jpg" alt="Glowy gold liver in blue outlined torso" class="wp-image-186417 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/GlowyGoldLiverInBlueTorsoOutline.jpg 683w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/GlowyGoldLiverInBlueTorsoOutline-642x481.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/GlowyGoldLiverInBlueTorsoOutline-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186417" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The liver produces C-reactive protein. (Sebastian Kaulitzki/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is C-reactive protein?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;C-reactive protein is created by the liver in response to infections, tissue damage, chronic inflammatory states from conditions like autoimmune diseases, and metabolic disturbances like obesity and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="186391" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, it is a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra2206346"&gt;marker of inflammation&lt;/a&gt; – meaning &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-inflammation-two-immunologists-explain-how-the-body-responds-to-everything-from-stings-to-vaccination-and-why-it-sometimes-goes-wrong-193503"&gt;immune system activation&lt;/a&gt; – in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C-reactive protein can be easily measured with blood work at the doctor's office. A low C-reactive protein level – under 1 milligram per deciliter – signifies minimal inflammation in the body, which is protective against heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An elevated C-reactive protein level of greater than 3 milligrams per deciliter, signifies increased levels of inflammation and thus &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines11092444"&gt;increased risk for heart disease&lt;/a&gt;. About 52 percent of Americans have an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM200504143521525"&gt;elevated level of C-reactive protein&lt;/a&gt; in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that C-reactive protein is a better predictive marker for heart attacks and strokes than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2405182"&gt;"bad," or LDL cholesterol, short for low-density lipoprotein&lt;/a&gt;, as well as another commonly measured genetically inherited biomarker called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2405182"&gt;lipoprotein(a)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study found that C-reactive protein &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61717-7"&gt;can predict heart disease just as well as blood pressure can&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why does inflammation matter in heart disease?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation plays a crucial role at every stage in the development and buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries, which causes a condition called &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt; that can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/hc0902.104353"&gt;lead to heart attacks and strokes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the moment a blood vessel is damaged, be it &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.71433"&gt;from high blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2613.2000.00162.x"&gt;cigarette smoke&lt;/a&gt;, immune cells immediately infiltrate the area. Those immune cells subsequently engulf cholesterol particles that are typically floating around in the blood stream to form a fatty plaque that resides in the wall of the vessel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-mouth-and-your-heart-are-connected-gum-disease-linked-to-heart-risks"&gt; 'Your Mouth And Your Heart Are Connected': Gum Disease Linked to Heart Risks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process continues for decades until eventually, one day, immune mediators rupture the cap that encloses the plaque. This triggers the formation of a blood clot that obstructs blood flow, starves the surrounding tissues of oxygen and ultimately causes a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, cholesterol is only part of the story; it is, in fact, the immune system that facilitates each step in the processes that drive heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can diet influence C-reactive protein levels?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle can significantly influence the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487319885458"&gt;amount of C-reactive protein produced by the liver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous foods and nutrients have been shown to lower C-reactive protein levels, including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3109/09637486.2014.959898"&gt;dietary fiber from foods like beans, vegetables, nuts and seeds&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.110922"&gt;berries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2025.2525446"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctim.2019.08.019"&gt;green tea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12986-024-00847-3"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2024.106868"&gt;flaxseeds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.167.1.31"&gt;Weight loss&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2016-095999"&gt;and exercise&lt;/a&gt; can also reduce C-reactive protein levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Does cholesterol still matter for heart disease risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though cholesterol may not be the most important predictor of risk for heart disease, it does remain highly relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's not just the amount of cholesterol – or more specifically the amount of bad, or LDL, cholesterol – that matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two people with the same cholesterol level don't necessarily have the same risk for heart disease. This is because risk is determined more so by the number of particles that the bad cholesterol is packaged into, as opposed to the total mass of bad cholesterol that's floating around. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.068885"&gt;More particles means higher risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why a blood test known as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/24992-apolipoprotein-b-test"&gt;apolipoprotein B&lt;/a&gt;, which measures the number of cholesterol particles, is a better predictor of risk for heart disease than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2021.5083"&gt;measurements of total amounts of bad cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like cholesterol and C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B is also influenced by lifestyle factors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1055/a-2580-0722"&gt;like exercise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12944-019-1094-4"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; and diet. Nutrients like &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954422416000147"&gt;fiber, nuts and omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; are associated with a decreased number of cholesterol particles, while &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9030211"&gt;increased sugar intake is associated with a larger number&lt;/a&gt; of cholesterol particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/genetic-conditions/lipoprotein-a"&gt;lipoprotein(a)&lt;/a&gt;, a protein that lives in the wall surrounding cholesterol particles, is another marker that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/ATV.0000000000000147"&gt;can predict heart disease more accurately than cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;. This is because the presence of lipoprotein(a) makes cholesterol particles sticky, so to speak, and thus more likely to get trapped in an atherosclerotic plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, unlike other risk factors, lipoprotein(a) levels are purely genetic, thus not influenced by lifestyle, and need only be measured once in a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-finds-inflammation-could-be-a-core-feature-of-depression"&gt;Huge Study Finds Inflammation Could Be a Core Feature of Depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What's the best way to prevent heart disease?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, heart disease is the product of many risk factors and their interactions over a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, preventing heart disease is way more complicated than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/128.2.449S"&gt;simply eating a cholesterol-free diet, as once thought&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing your LDL cholesterol level alongside your C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein (a) levels paints a comprehensive picture of risk that can hopefully help motivate long-term commitment to the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/how-to-help-prevent-heart-disease-at-any-age"&gt;fundamentals of heart disease prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include eating well, exercising consistently, getting adequate sleep, managing stress productively, maintaining healthy weight and, if applicable, quitting smoking.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271143/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers were surprised after a lengthy study of an essential fatty acid, &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251217/Plant-based-omega-3s-work-better-than-expected-in-a-year-long-diet-study.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;News-Medical&lt;/a&gt; reported, with findings particularly relevant to several popular dietary lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1727308/full" target="_blank"&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, focused on long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which the authors stipulated were of concern for those on vegetarian and vegan diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids play a vital role in several critical health metrics, supporting cardiovascular and immune function, cognition, and fighting inflammation. The study noted that these essential nutrients were often found in meat, fish, and dairy, posing a challenge to plant-based diners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flaxseed oil is a known plant-based source of alpha-linolenic acid, an essential omega-3 fatty acid, and News-Medical mentioned a standing "widespread assumption that the human body only poorly converts plant-derived ALA" versus omega-3s found in meat and fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-dd5d8154a7dddd210267264b57e0df70 theco-biolite-woah-widget" id="theco-dd5d8154a7dddd210267264b57e0df70"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-f08166b4b2896cebc6f94db7ace149c9 theco-recurrent-woah-widget" id="theco-f08166b4b2896cebc6f94db7ace149c9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-8e6f799210d60a2599df4aaceb8eeee3 theco-trashie-widget-woah" id="theco-8e6f799210d60a2599df4aaceb8eeee3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-1a6dbef5b9f0666b82004d36cebd1efe theco-rewiring-america-widget-woah" id="theco-1a6dbef5b9f0666b82004d36cebd1efe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-bcb081c0ea85a715aab660e91d307c2d theco-greenportfolio-woah" id="theco-bcb081c0ea85a715aab660e91d307c2d"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers identified 168 individuals aged 18 to 70, all of whom had followed an omnivorous, flexitarian, vegetarian, or vegan diet for one year prior to the start of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-5c7e6d6b6248df2d647cbc52e0b9570e theco-nolan-interior-permalink" id="theco-5c7e6d6b6248df2d647cbc52e0b9570e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the authors indicated, vegetarian and vegan lifestyles are becoming increasingly popular worldwide for myriad reasons, particularly among &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11241807/" target="_blank"&gt;Generation Z&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="theco-inline-advertorial theco-target" id="theco-33088864" data-theco-trackid="641395" data-theco-trackbid="1"&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p class="theco-0cef1f4246938b8dc9e44fb7fa2f94f7 theco-embedded-video" id="theco-0cef1f4246938b8dc9e44fb7fa2f94f7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They cited a range of ethical, &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/sustainable-food/vegetarian-diet-cancer-study-reduced-risk/" target="_blank"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, and environmental benefits as a factor in the growing popularity of &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/explore-plant-based-food-options/" target="_blank"&gt;plant-based diets&lt;/a&gt;. Rising &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/sustainable-food/rising-grocery-costs-us-states-strain/" target="_blank"&gt;food costs&lt;/a&gt; are likely fueling some dietary changes, since &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/sustainable-food/study-groceries-cost-less-eating-meatless/" target="_blank"&gt;meatless alternatives&lt;/a&gt; tend to be &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/eat-cleaner-cheaper-food/" target="_blank"&gt;more affordable&lt;/a&gt; and less perishable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;High-profile campaigns like &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/sustainable-food/veganuary-participation-vegan-diet-plant-based/" target="_blank"&gt;Veganuary&lt;/a&gt; are another factor, as is a broader tendency toward hybrid dietary approaches and &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/grow-your-own-food/" target="_blank"&gt;growing food&lt;/a&gt; at home. Opting for &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/sustainable-food/plant-based-meats-sustainable-food/" target="_blank"&gt;plant-forward meals&lt;/a&gt; rather than a 100% vegan lifestyle, sometimes called "&lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/sustainable-food/gen-z-flexitarian-diets-vegetarian/" target="_blank"&gt;flexitarianism&lt;/a&gt;," is also becoming &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/sustainable-food/reducetarian-foundation-colorado-denver-meat/" target="_blank"&gt;more common&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-697c3c9fc457884bb6d53dcdb4e3b8e5 theco-recurrent-2-woah-widget" id="theco-697c3c9fc457884bb6d53dcdb4e3b8e5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants followed "nutrient-optimized menu plans" for one year, supplementing their diets with flaxseed oil for nine months after the first three months of the study. The authors collected blood samples at three-month intervals, examining the study subjects at 12 and 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the end of the study, researchers determined that "systematic long-term dietary intake of ALA … leads to a significant increase in EPA, DPA and DHA concentrations" irrespective of participants' dietary patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, researchers also found that while vegans and vegetarians demonstrated lower blood "concentrations than omnivores" at the study's conclusion, they "on average surpass omnivorous levels at the beginning of the intervention."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As such, the authors advised vegans and vegetarians to "regularly consume" plant-based foods or supplements rich in essential fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-4cbc6ba96c4c8c9121dd35d5ca0ab725 theco-ad-after-12th-p" id="theco-4cbc6ba96c4c8c9121dd35d5ca0ab725"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And, because both the medications and the alcohol independently suppresses brainstem activity, which controls automatic functions, the combination reduces the brain's drive to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But more innocuous medications do not play well with alcohol, either. That group includes &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15152543/over-counter-painkillers-alcohol-risk.html"&gt;over-the-counter pain relievers&lt;/a&gt; like ibuprofen, which can contribute to liver and gastrointestinal damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Combining ibuprofen and alcohol raises the risk of bleeding in the stomach and small intestine, which can result in vomiting blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Barbara Sparacino, an adult and geriatric psychiatrist, told the Daily Mail that a practical rule of thumb is to avoid mixing alcohol with any medication that helps you sleep, relax or relieve pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The holiday season often means festive drinks and special wines, but experts warn that mixing alcohol with common medications can pose serious risks that are easily avoided (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin already increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Adding just one alcoholic drink can raise that risk by approximately 37 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For stronger sedatives, such as opioids and benzodiazepines, complete abstinence from alcohol is safest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you do decide to drink, you should avoid drinking heavily and never drive after. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By one estimate, roughly 40 percent of Americans take a medication that interacts dangerously with alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to dangerous side effects, the medicine might lose its efficacy when it comes in contact with alcohol and speed its clearance from the body without working as intended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A medication can also influence the absorption of alcohol, potentially resulting in higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) and other adverse effects like shallow breathing and overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can also heighten the effects of a medication and increase the amount of it in a person's body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After speaking with several doctors, the Daily Mail can reveal which over-the-counter and prescription medications&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;you should not mix with alcohol - along with the experts' reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Over-the-counter pain relievers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (sold under the brand names Advil and Motrin), naproxen (sold as Aleve and Naprosyn) and aspirin are associated with a higher risk of GI bleeds on their own. But, when combined with just one drink, that risk climbs by about 37 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's likely fine to take an occasional dose of ibuprofen if you've consumed a small quantity of alcohol, roughly one or two drinks. The combination becomes more dangerous if you take ibuprofen regularly and tend to drink heavily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acetaminophen (sold as Tylenol) is the most popular pain reliever in the US, but it interacts in a unique - and potentially deadly - way with alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taking too much acetaminophen accounts for almost half of all cases of acute liver failure in North America and approximately 20 percent of liver transplant cases in the US. Mixing acetaminophen with alcohol compounds the risk of deadly liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The liver of a person who drinks heavily and often produces more of a specific enzyme called CYP2E1 to break down the alcohol. This same enzyme also processes acetaminophen. The problem is that this process creates a toxic byproduct called NAPQI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taking acetaminophen preemptively or after heavy drinking causes the overactive enzyme system to produce dangerously high levels of NAPQI, which can overwhelm and destroy the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this, the FDA has mandated that every bottle of acetaminophen products have a label stating that 'severe liver damage may occur if an adult has three or more alcoholic drinks every day while using this product.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The main ingredient in common cold and flu medicines is a central nervous system depressant, like alcohol. Combined, they make a person feel dizzier and more impaired than they would by taking either one alone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Over-the-counter cold and flu medicines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cold and flu remedies should never mix with alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A bad flu is dehydrating, and adding alcohol dehydrates the body further as alcohol triggers a diuretic effect. All of the efforts to hydrate, from bottles of water to a bowl of soup, are then eliminated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dehydration can exacerbate flu symptoms like headache, fatigue, dizziness and muscle weakness, and ultimately prolong recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol also exacerbates the side effects of popular cough medicines like Theraflu cough syrups, Dayquil, Nyquil and Tylenol Severe Cold and Flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like alcohol, their main ingredient, dextromethorphan (DXM), is a central nervous system depressant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Combining the two increases side effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, impaired coordination and difficulty concentrating. People who combine the two are at higher risk of light stumbles turning to dangerous falls and other injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taking DXM with alcohol can also cause breathing to slow or stop entirely, feelings of dissociation, brain lesions, epilepsy or permanent psychosis. It is best to avoid alcohol until the drug has left your body, about 24 to 48 hours after your last dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alcohol exacerbates the effects of allergy medications, such as drowsiness and loss of coordination, putting someone at risk of injury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Allergy medicines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol heightens the side effects of popular allergy medicines, including Mucinex, Allegra, Claritin and Zyrtec, leaving you feeling more drowsy, dizzy or impaired than you would from the medication alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many antihistamines - the main ingredients in allergy medicines - are central nervous system depressants just like alcohol. Combining them can have an additive effect, slowing down brain activity more than either substance would by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Benadryl, the oldest generation of current allergy medications, has a stronger sedative effect than others, and that effect is amplified further when combined with a drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sudafed, a common nasal decongestant, is a stimulant that can mask the sedating effects of alcohol and make someone feel less intoxicated than they actually are. This can cause a person to drink more than they intended, raising the risk of alcohol poisoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both Sudafed and alcohol can raise heart rate and blood pressure individually. Combining them can heighten this effect, which is especially dangerous for individuals with preexisting heart conditions or hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For safety, it is generally recommended to avoid alcohol when taking these medications, especially if you need to drive or operate machinery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Both alcohol and many antibiotics such as azithromycin are metabolized by the liver. Drinking while on medication forces the liver to work harder, placing significant strain on the organ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Antibiotics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Combining alcohol with antibiotics can interfere with your body's healing process in several key ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, alcohol can impair the immune system's efficiency, making it harder for the body to fight the very infection the antibiotic is meant to treat. This can potentially prolong illness and delay recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More directly, both alcohol and many antibiotics are metabolized by the liver. Consuming them together places a significant strain on this vital organ, as it must work overtime to process both substances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can exacerbate common antibiotic side effects like nausea, dizziness and drowsiness, making a person feel significantly worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the case of certain antibiotics, like metronidazole, the interaction is severe and deliberate, causing a chemical reaction that leads to intensely unpleasant symptoms such as severe vomiting, rapid heart rate and headache. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beyond the immediate discomfort, mixing alcohol and antibiotics can compromise the medication's effectiveness. Alcohol can disrupt the absorption and metabolism of the drug, potentially lowering its concentration in the bloodstream to a level that is insufficient to eradicate bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This not only risks treatment failure, but contributes to a larger public health crisis: antibiotic resistance. When antibiotics are not allowed to work at full strength, it creates an environment where stronger, more resistant bacteria can survive and multiply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, abstaining from all alcohol for the full duration of the prescription is critical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Barbara Sparacino, a psychiatrist, advises never mixing alcohol with sleep, relaxation, or pain medications. With strong sedatives like opioids or benzodiazepines, total avoidance of alcohol is essential, especially for older adults or those on multiple sedating drugs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Antidepressants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Combining antidepressant medications with alcohol has a similar effect on the respiratory system as benzodiazepines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While drinking may provide temporary relief from depression symptoms and aid in dealing with social anxiety, alcohol blocks the ability of antidepressants to do their job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SSRIs like Zoloft and Prozac, and SNRIs like Effexor work over time to regulate and stabilize key neurotransmitter systems (serotonin and norepinephrine) to improve mood, sleep and anxiety in a sustained way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol is a chemical disruptor. It initially causes a brief, artificial release of serotonin and dopamine, creating a mood boost, but a rapid depletion of those neurotransmitters follows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the short term, this leads to mood swings. With regular use, it can create or worsen a chemical imbalance that promotes depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The combination impairs reaction time, judgement, and decision-making more than either substance on its own, and, due to the depletion of mood-boosting neurotransmitters, has a higher likelihood of causing suicidal ideations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking while taking antidepressants also reduces the odds that the medicine will work as intended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There's no universally safe limit for drinking alcohol while taking antidepressants, because even a small amount can interact poorly with the medications and make depression or anxiety worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many doctors advise avoiding alcohol altogether or sticking to one to two moderate drinks - a 12-ounce beer, a five-ounce glass of wine or a one-ounce shot of liquor, regardless of gender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alcohol plays a role in about 20 percent of all benzodiazepine overdoses, making it one of the most lethal drug interactions. Both substances severely depress the central nervous system, specifically slowing the body's ability to breathe, which can lead to fatal respiratory failure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Benzodiazepines &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol is implicated in approximately 20 percent of all benzodiazepine overdoses, constituting one of the most dangerous drug interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People taking benzodiazepines should avoid alcohol entirely.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The danger primarily stems from how both substances profoundly suppress the central nervous system, specifically targeting the body's capacity to breathe. When combined, they dramatically increase the risk of severe and potentially fatal respiratory depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This life-threatening consequence occurs because both alcohol and benzodiazepines, along with many antidepressants, amplify the effects of the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GABA is responsible for calming neural activity, and its excessive enhancement leads to extreme sedation of the body's vital functions, resulting not only in respiratory failure but also in cardiovascular collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beyond the acute physical dangers, the mixture of benzodiazepines and alcohol can induce severe psychological and behavioral problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Users may experience complete anterograde amnesia, in which they cannot form new memories properly, losing all memory for hours while conscious and active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This blackout state is associated with high-risk behaviors, including unsafe sexual practices, impulsive aggression or severe self harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Individuals may experience intense suicidal thoughts and act on them, with no subsequent recollection of their actions, creating a uniquely hazardous situation for both the individual and those around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This combination is a major contributor to ER visits and accidental overdoses, even at doses people think are "normal,"' Sparacino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of severe interactions are even higher among older people.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So a drink that felt "mild" at 40 can feel like three drinks at 75, especially when layered on top of sedating meds,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's part of why we see more falls, confusion and ER visits in older adults mixing alcohol with prescriptions.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alcohol and blood thinners each independently slow the blood's clotting ability. When used together, their effects are dangerously amplified, making it significantly harder to stop bleeding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Blood thinners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just as risky are prescription blood thinners, common among older people with blood clotting disorders that increase the risks of heart attack and stroke. The danger comes as alcohol can significantly raise someone's risk for dangerous bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both alcohol and blood thinners independently inhibit the blood's ability to clot. Together, their effects can be more than additive, creating a powerful synergy that makes bleeding much harder to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, a simple scrape or nick that would normally stop bleeding within minutes could bleed for much longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol also irritates the stomach lining, and any kind of perforation due to an ulcer can cause internal bleeding in the GI tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other popular blood thinners significantly alter alcohol metabolism. This means that a person who drinks a modest amount but is on a blood thinner might actually have a much higher BAC than a person who drinks the same amount of alcohol but is not taking the medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can also cause dangerously low blood pressure, causing dizziness and fainting.&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To prevent the negative effects, doctors recommend that patients limit their alcohol intake to one to two standard drinks at a time, alternating with water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sometimes taken in addition to blood thinners are cholesterol medications known as statins. These come with their own risks when paired with alcohol, Dr Raul Santos, a board-certified cardiovascular specialist, told the Daily Mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Excessive alcohol consumption or binge drinking in individuals using statins may increase the risk of muscle problems, muscle aches and, very rarely, muscle inflammation or even destruction of muscle cells [Rhabdomyolysis],' Santos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Muscle aches in randomized controlled trials occur in one to three percent of the population, while in real life, numerous confounding factors affect ten to 20 percent of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Rhabdomyolysis is extremely rare, occurring in 0.01 percent of patients taking statins. Excess alcohol can harm the muscles, and statins may exacerbate this effect.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

She was discharged as normal the day after her birth and followed up by community midwives, who were happy with her initial progress. The first alarm bells began to sound at around three to four weeks, when weight gain and feeding were proving to be a significant challenge. At the time, her only diagnosis was that of an “un-greedy baby”. That changed dramatically at around two months, when ultrasounds showed that she had huge volumes of fluid in her abdomen and around her heart, and she was rushed to Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) for immediate life-saving treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Our first Christmas morning as a family was in intensive care. At just under three months she was diagnosed with the rare metabolic condition known as PMM2-CDG, a diagnosis she shares with an estimated 1,000-2,400 others worldwide, and one that threw up so many complications that it has seen her spend most of her young life at GOSH, where my husband, Steve, or I would take turns staying in a single bed in her room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="2.2"&gt;&lt;div id="2cee193d-b3b1-451d-b966-5c27afbb4354"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Ruby was diagnosed with the rare metabolic condition known as PMM2-CDG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Ruby’s condition is multi-systemic, and had a particularly detrimental effect on her liver from a very early stage. This turned out to be the cause of the dangerous episodes of fluid retention, inability to gain weight or grow muscle, and also two catastrophic seizures, which saw her requiring full resuscitation and admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), because her liver could not adequately filter her blood, resulting in a toxic level of ammonia in her system. These were the most terrifying times of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;At first, a transplant was discussed only as a last resort (“We do not expect that to be the case,” the consultant said), but as time passed it became clear that it had the potential to be, not an all-out cure, but transformative within the context of her condition. Sure enough, after an in-patient assessment in King’s College Hospital’s Rays of Sunshine Ward, including extensive scans and blood tests, as well as careful discussions about the efficacy and safety of this major procedure, it was confirmed that Ruby was indeed a candidate for a liver transplant. She would be the first PMM2-CDG patient in Europe to receive one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/parenting/article/born-an-addict-my-adopted-daughters-heartbreaking-struggle-w2dtkrrc9" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Born an addict, my adopted daughter’s heartbreaking struggle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I knew immediately that I wanted to be her donor. As well as being in good health, and a close genetic match, I felt that any other option such as waiting for a deceased donor would simply delay things for too long. I also instinctively felt that, as her mother, it had to come from me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;My work-up began the following week, starting with a day of imaging and tests. The living donation process is complex and considered high risk, not just for the recipient, but the donor as well. Of course, the benefit of helping my child to become well was worth any risk, but I found that my deeply emotional connection to the whole process was often tempered by the surgeons’ meticulous precision and logic. I was assigned a living donor transplant co-ordinator, the wonderful Matilda, who helped to humanise the process by translating clinical scenarios into words I could actually understand and thus helping me prepare mentally, allowing space for me to deal with the myriad and often conflicting emotions of excitement, fear, impatience and relief, alongside the many practicalities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The first date we were offered was in April, which, when given in January, felt like a very long time to wait. Little did I know at the time, but we would end up waiting longer. Liver transplants in vulnerable babies are complex enough already, and the element of a live donor adds an extra layer, meaning that various things have to be in place, such as two surgical teams being available at the same time, plus two theatres in close proximity, two intensive care unit (ICU) beds for the aftermath, and so on. Only about 15 of these surgeries take place a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="2.11"&gt;&lt;div id="9c7f6fe5-955e-4051-a00a-19c995f7a571"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Being in good health and a close genetic match, Elle signed up to be her daughter’s liver donor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Although we were all ready to go in April, another child awaiting transplant had become more critical, and so urgently needed to take that slot. Our new surgery date was pushed back until May, which didn’t feel too long to wait by then, but the anxiety of trying to keep our daughter well, especially when we were spending so much time in hospital, was extreme. Even in protective isolation, she could easily destabilise in ways that would see the surgery cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;On the eve of the May surgery date, one of Ruby’s blood tests came back with a value that didn’t give anyone the confidence that the surgery should go ahead on that date. No one expects medically complex patients to have perfect blood results, but one organ that must be functioning well — because of how it is initially “hit” by the immediate aftermath of the surgery — is the kidneys, and her kidney function was not as they would have liked it to be. As one surgeon said, “She would have probably been fine — but probably isn’t good enough.” I take great comfort from the care that they displayed with that decision. I attended the meeting with the surgeons, where the news of cancellation would be confirmed, fully gowned up and in compression socks, because I had to be fully prepared to go, just in case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Another month passed, and this time, finally, we were good to go. I spent the night before in Ruby’s hospital room and had collected my gown and surgical wash in advance, so that I could spend the maximum amount of time with her before making my way down to be admitted. My surgery was to take place first in the schedule; they would remove the piece of my liver, check that it reflected everything they had on file, and only then would they bring her down to theatre. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;When the time came, once I had kissed Steve goodbye, there was a surprisingly buoyant atmosphere among the surgeons and anaesthetists as they got to work — a bit like what you might find on the morning of a long-anticipated wedding day. I had assumed I would be asked to count down from ten while put to sleep, but instead I was cut off by a deep, chemically induced slumber mid-sentence, telling the medical staff about my job as a yoga teacher. The next thing I remember was being roused energetically, a nasogastric tube being pulled out of my nose as my eyes began to flicker open. It felt as though nothing had happened and no time had passed, but in fact my surgery alone had taken about four hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/gosh-gene-therapy-granulomatous-disease-8vr6tzhwc" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pioneering gene therapy tricks teen’s cells and transforms his life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;News of Ruby’s surgery progressing well helped to bring me out of my daze. I was taken to ICU, where I remained pretty much bed-bound. Finally, after two days, I was reunited with my daughter in the PICU. I was pushed up in a wheelchair, and even sitting upright seemed to take all of my energy, but it was worth it to see Ruby. She was intubated, and hooked up to more IVs than I had ever seen, but I felt a wave of calm wash over me, because my mother’s instinct told me in that moment that she was going to be OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The days and weeks that followed were tough, not least because Ruby’s newly suppressed immune system meant that any virus or infection going latched onto her. Still recovering from my own surgery meant that picking her up to comfort her was a physical challenge. My energy and focus felt significantly depleted; trying to maintain advocacy for a child with a rare and complex condition in hospital asks a lot of you at the best of times, so it was during this period that I found myself truly at my limit. It was worth it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;They say that you get a completely different child post-transplant — but, while the changes are indeed remarkable, I would say that Ruby is more herself than ever before. Inside her previously poorly, undernourished body there had always been a vibrant, funny, kind and curious little girl with an incredibly mighty spirit, and now her body possesses the strength and energy to let her live fully. She is bigger and stronger, having gained two kilos in weight and added length to her frame in just a matter of weeks post-surgery. She feeds better and has much more energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Her cognitive development has accelerated significantly. It is clear that her eyesight has improved and that she is able to engage and interact more. She can now sit independently for short periods, there is a new stability to her spine and core, and as a result she is exploring more movement, thus able to really start embodying her clear curiosity for the world around her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Although some very exciting and potentially curative treatments are now in trial, this liver transplant, for her, has been the most meaningful step forward in her condition so far, and it places her in the advantageous position of being well enough to really benefit from the many promising potential therapies on the horizon, such as gene therapy and novel work into brain organoids. We, and other families as part of &lt;a href="https://cdg-uk.org/" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;CDG UK&lt;/a&gt;, are working hard to fund and collaborate with numerous research bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There are still challenges. We were warned that the first year post-transplant is the toughest, as they keep the levels of immunosuppression particularly high to ensure her body doesn’t reject the transplanted liver. This has come with its own complications as she has become more susceptible to catching bugs with the winter months. While seeing her progress developmentally has been a joy, my main hopes for the transplant were that she would not be so frequently unwell and that she would not have to spend so much of her life confined to the four walls of a hospital cubicle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;After some joyful time at home as a family, there has been a lot more hospital time lately. We are looking at Christmas here at Great Ormond Street, which will be our second, as we were able to spend last Christmas at home. However, we know that this is just another bump in the road, of which we’ve endured many, and we are fortunate to have a lot of support from our family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/science/article/hopes-rise-of-a-cheap-cure-for-rare-genetic-diseases-ghhzvrx05?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfOqVSoEJwWokOToR3JNfgRPhamHu-ImwNJ3xV8Kr22lUGXdektIOFm4stfuJ8%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=69457870&amp;amp;gaa_sig=-qYjTUKjgmIh6qtIXZgxz9D4H0q9D3xplzNtimPhyeSyuo_CNmJed5mOYTjO2IaPw00ASjGzAyN7z5T9gFo8MQ%3D%3D" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hopes rise of a cheap cure for rare genetic diseases&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;As well as having her whole extended family around her, she is supported by an excellent community team of nurses, therapists and play workers, and, when at home, has ongoing outpatient monitoring from GOSH, King’s and University College Hospital. This has not been an easy journey, but one of its many gifts has been to remind me that real human kindness exists and it has introduced me to a wealth of individuals who make it their mission to care for you and to make your life that little bit easier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I am frequently met with admiration when people learn that I was her donor, but I am simply doing what any parent would do for their child, given the chance. Fear simply isn’t an obstacle when your child’s life is at stake. On paper, PMM2-CDG can sound bleak, but when you meet my daughter, and all the other children like her, you realise that there is a whole, vital and life-loving person beyond the diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can support children living with PMM2-CDG by visiting &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdg-uk.org/support-us/" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;cdg-uk.org/support-us&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; and following &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/projectpmm2/" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;@projectpmm2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; on Instagram &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxNcHh4aTl0bXl0ZElFSXlWSnBKeDg5SXpRUjZWcGVMT2VBbmNMM2tSWER5T3ltUExBQjVkX0Rxa2dqZnNIVDRDcktkSW85TDJyY295MVFOTmFUWE1XNS1yR0dFTFJlQUlQakNvY1k2V0lfVWxEYTZqRUJ3MVVfdExtekRpN0tsNUJWLWNhTTRoMnZGOGFCUFhUcnVtUV9WTXB0QXhRX2dGTHBUTnBUcDVYRWV5eFhlLS1GdXRHbkVR</guid></item><item><title>隐性感染可能是长期新冠肺炎的缺失环节- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/hidden-infections-may-be-the-missing-link-in-long-covid/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 22:49:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQeTNsc0pXNjF1R3pxbXR1amRTTk1qLUVTUGxROFFpSHpwVVpFQ09iSWpoTExtdnBYMjg5ZlYweW5CcEJDTTlDQ2Y4TWZtdy1tQTRwWWNkb0ZSNXNMdlNiSUg1cXlzeXJodmZLU0FOcE9fWFpyLUpxMUctWUZpX2xRaFpBVEJPd2g2</guid></item><item><title>麻省理工学院的科学家发现了恢复免疫系统活力的方法- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/mit-scientists-have-discovered-a-way-to-rejuvenate-the-immune-system/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 21:39:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQNUNndE5HV0VPQW9MWnNxVzE2bXN5WnpjTTZWUXdzRnFTZUZEWU9jZjQ0MHdFLUhMQWN4aEx2RFJPRTRCLXVqdFV6YVhmcVNHa2pzWUZvcmVXWWI1V1BCOVFCWEgwbkNWNm5RSTVXVmJ5c3RpVF85TE1KMHhPY3ctOEs3Y1Npamluam5LU19oUXpkby1rTlQwa0ZR</guid></item><item><title>NHS将试验可能挽救生命的致命肝病治疗方法--《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/21/nhs-to-trial-potentially-life-saving-treatment-for-deadly-liver-disease</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; is to trial a potentially life-saving new treatment for a deadly liver disease that causes the body’s vital organs to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Thirteen major hospitals will use a device that cleans patients’ blood that has become corrupted by toxins as a result of them developing acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;ACLF is a severe and hard-to-treat form of liver disease linked to obesity, alcohol and hepatitis, in which patients suddenly deteriorate and have to be admitted to intensive care. Three out of four people affected are only diagnosed when it has already become life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Seven out of 10 people with the disease die within 28 days and only a handful of those affected are eligible for a liver transplant, which is the only existing way to reverse ACLF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Seventy-two seriously ill patients will take part in the randomised controlled trial of a machine called Dialive, starting early next year. Doctors involved say that it “offers new hope” and could reduce the condition’s high death rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If it proves successful, it could become the first form of liver dialysis in global medicine. Dialive seeks to aid recovery by removing dysfunctional albumin – a protein produced by the liver – and replacing it with clean, functional albumin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The “intensive care liver support system” works in a similar way to what happens during &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org.uk/what-is-peritoneal-dialysis" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;haemodialysis&lt;/a&gt;, a long-established treatment for people whose kidneys have stopped working properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/12/dialysis-graphic/giv-32554PdR5wIZxYEug/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"dialysis graphic","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0},"elementId":"d30ff27c-210b-4670-9af3-a4076f4d2895","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="d30ff27c-210b-4670-9af3-a4076f4d2895" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="dialysis graphic" data-testid="interactive-element-dialysis%20graphic" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/12/dialysis-graphic/giv-32554PdR5wIZxYEug/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;dialysis graphic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Patients are hooked up to the Dialive device while it removes harmful substances from their blood, which helps their liver and other organs to recover and increases their chances of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Those in the trial will already be suffering from two or more organ failures. They will have sessions of treatment on their first, second and third days and then up to four more within the first 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Our goal is to demonstrate that we can resolve life-threatening ACLF more often and faster than standard care, and thereby impact both patients’ time in hospital and chances of survival,” said Rajiv Jalan, a senior liver specialist and co-principal investigator of the trial who founded &lt;a href="https://yaqrit.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Yaqrit&lt;/a&gt;, the medical innovation company that developed the device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“These are gravely ill patients with multi-organ failure and high risk of death, so there is a desperate need for effective treatments not only here but all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Dialive cleans the blood of toxins that accumulate in the body because the liver is not working and therefore prevents further damage and allows the liver to regenerate”, added Jalan, who is a professor of hepatology at University College London (UCL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="9c7c5c3f-1ad5-4538-98ca-46182c83d94d" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Rajiv Jalan is the scientific director of European Foundation for the Study of Chronic Liver Failure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yaqrit is a UCL spinout company that specialises in developing new drugs and devices to treat severe liver disease, which is rising worldwide as a result of soaring obesity, heavy drinking and hepatitis infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An estimated 2 million people in the UK have some form of liver disease, and rates have quadrupled over the past 50 years. About 60,000 of them have cirrhosis – severe inflammation and scarring – of the liver that puts them at risk of dying. Liver disease kills more than 12,000 people a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The government-funded National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) is funding the £2.2m trial after a &lt;a href="https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/action/showPdf?pii=S0168-8278%2823%2900188-5" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;previous, smaller-scale study&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 into its safety and effectiveness found that Dialive showed promise for treating ACLF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ten of the 15 patients who had the treatment saw their ACLF reversed compared with just five of the 15 who had only standard treatment. Dialive patients also recovered faster than the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Rohit Saha, a consultant at the Royal Free hospital in London and another trial co-principal investigator, said: “Many [patients with ACLF] die because their bodies become trapped in a destructive cycle of inflammation that current treatments can’t reverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Dialive … offers new hope, with the potential to put this condition into remission and, for the first time in decades, give us a new path forward for our sickest liver patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;King’s College and University College London hospitals in the capital and the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham will be the first three of the 13 teaching hospitals to recruit patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Thousands of people are admitted to NHS hospitals every year with ACLF and there are three possible outcomes: transplant, death or recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Mansoor Bangash, a consultant at the Queen Elizabeth and fellow principal investigator, said: “If we can support more patients to recover, with new devices like Dialive, while simultaneously tackling underlying infections, then we can improve survival rates, stabilise their health and ensure they are in the best possible condition for a transplant-free future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The NIHR said that it was covering the costs of the trial because, if it works, the device may mean patients with severe liver disease no longer need to have a liver transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Mike Lewis, its scientific director for innovation, said: “Acute-on-chronic liver failure is a dangerous – and often deadly – condition. The only available treatment for it is a transplant, which isn’t always possible or an organ available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If this NIHR-funded trial of Dialive is successful, it will bring dramatic benefits for patients, providing a treatment for ACLF that will save lives and reduce hospital stay. This is taxpayer-funded research at its best, making treatments on the NHS available when they are needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 18:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNWEZUM1lGQ1JOY3V6empaaUlkYThDMkJnb2M0OWRtbjVMRVgxTHptS2lRVVFfb3RjNEt3VllYX2l2WW9kc0FKVlpZNFRRNUU2OFhPckFIaGk1VkdiNFFjOVNxUkNrYUYtakZqQURJTVFISFRtM3pWb1RHOTU1X3RKNG1NS1pSUzc5V2l3R0oxdWlVWjI3TDZzTlNpMjNKMElsb09xMlU3dmZTQVAzaXZGb0FsVU5QT0puZWFj</guid></item><item><title>自然日光如何帮助糖尿病患者改善血糖水平- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-12-natural-daylight-people-diabetes-blood.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cabbage might be &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/most-underrated-vegetable-according-to-food-editor-8749622" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the most underappreciated vegetable&lt;/a&gt; in our produce drawers. Like the quiet hum of a machine laboring in the background, this cruciferous powerhouse shows up across global cuisines, adding crunch to fish tacos, depth to stir-fries and comfort to classic braises. Yet when it comes to cooking cabbage at home, it can be the vegetable equivalent of elevator music—reliable but unremarkable and sometimes even a little bit boring. What culinary magic can transform this humble ingredient into irresistible dishes?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To explore all that cabbage has to offer, I reached out to three culinary pros with a true appreciation for the veg. The one thing they heartily agreed on was that cabbage, prepared in many ways, was &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291458/how-to-cook-cabbage-so-its-delicious/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anything but boring&lt;/a&gt;! But when forced to choose a “top” cooking method, it came down to the simple sauté, a technique that results in a perfect tender-crisp texture with just a hint of char. With just a pan and a little patience, this everyday ingredient can shed its wallflower reputation and show us what it’s really made of.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-tips-for-sauting-cabbage"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Tips for Sautéing Cabbage &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When discussing technique, the chefs all agreed that &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; sautéing was a cornerstone of good cabbage cookery, with “proper” being the key word. Sauté means quickly cooking food in oil or fat over relatively high heat. The term comes from the French word “sauter,” which means "to jump" and refers to how food is often tossed or stirred in the pan to ensure even cooking. However, mastering this technique comes down to three key elements: proper pan size, heat control and seasoning technique, according to our chefs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Use a Large Pan &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Use the biggest pan you have for more surface area,” advises &lt;a href="https://www.chefheidifink.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Heidi Fink&lt;/a&gt;, former executive chef of the renowned ReBar Modern Food restaurant in Victoria, British Columbia, and award-winning cooking instructor and TV host. “This is better for both [the] cabbage contacting the heat source and for evaporation. A smaller pan means less evaporation,” which she explains steams the cabbage rather than sautéing it. “It’s also important to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7943828/how-to-cut-cabbage/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cut the cabbage&lt;/a&gt; into even sizes,” she adds, so that everything will cook through at the same time. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Control the Heat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fink advises to start with high heat and “enough fat to coat the whole pan,” adding that if you want very tender cabbage, you can turn down the heat after the initial sauté, and cover (or partially cover) to braise it slowly. Braising is a cooking method that combines dry and moist heat techniques and often goes hand-in-hand with sautéing. It involves sautéing or searing the food at a high temperature to develop a rich, caramelized surface, then slowly cooking it in a covered pot with a small amount of liquid at a low temperature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.carlacontreras.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Carla Contreras&lt;/a&gt;, a New Jersey–based food stylist, podcast host and former chef with more than 25 years of culinary experience, including at Daniel Boulud’s DBGB and the Marriott Boston, prefers to start with olive oil in a cold pan before turning up the heat. She adds the cabbage to the pan along with “the smallest pinch of sea salt and a few cranks of fresh ground pepper.”  She’ll then turn up the heat to medium-high and sauté for a few minutes—enough to wilt it while retaining a toothsome bite. For a softer texture, she suggests adding a splash of water or your favorite vinegar and letting that cook down in the pan for a few extra minutes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Temperature control is essential, and using it differently will yield different results. For &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/chickswithknives/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Rachael Narins&lt;/a&gt;, a Los Angeles–based chef, three-time cookbook author and co-founder of Chicks with Knives, that means getting a “dry cast-iron pan screaming hot!” She adds diced or wedged cabbage to that hot pan with a bit of salt and, unlike the others, leaves the fat out&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;She prefers the light char it gets and appreciates how it “retains a bit of the crunch and a touch of smokiness while the sweetness is enhanced.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Season Well &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Contreras says that not seasoning with salt and pepper can make a dish decidedly underwhelming. Seasoning well, she says, is a simple solution for most cooking and the reason why restaurant food tastes so good.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-type-of-cabbage-is-best-for-sauting"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Type of Cabbage Is Best for Sautéing? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Luckily, this method works well with all cabbages, says Contreras, including white, red and Napa. Fink shares a little more nuance: “Red cabbage is much tougher than green cabbage; Savoy cabbage is more tender. Napa cabbage is much more delicate than any of them ... and green cabbage—I mean &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; a versatile vegetable!” Narins, who loves cabbage so much that she named her kitten Petit Chou&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(“little cabbage” in French) thinks the best choice is a head of napa or Savoy, which she explains are more tender than the more common green and red varieties. “Napa is such a switch artist,” adds Fink. “It’s mild and delicate enough for soups but has an amazing depth of flavor when browned.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Starting with a sauté (or sear), a classic for red cabbage is the German braised sweet-and-sour cabbage, says Fink: "It brings out a beautiful color, has lots of brightness in flavor, and the long braise really tenderizes the red cabbage. It’s a winner in the wintertime.” Getting some browning on green cabbage, via sautéing or other methods, brings out the nutty flavor, she adds. When it comes to prep, though, Fink is adamant that you have to slice or chop cabbage. “Never shredding—that brings out too much liquid.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-are-some-common-mistakes-when-cooking-cabbage"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Are Some Common Mistakes When Cooking Cabbage? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thankfully, the most common cabbage cooking mistakes are also easily fixed. For Fink, they include not cutting the vegetables into even sizes (especially cutting cabbage too big); not using a big enough or wide enough pan and not controlling the heat properly. Narins adds that the core of the cabbage should be discarded or sliced very thin, and two of our chefs insisted that you should always taste as you go. “The best and easiest way to know if you like [it],” says Contreras, “is to grab a fork and carefully taste it.” This way, she adds, “You get to decide what the perfect texture is for you.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-cabbage-recipe-ideas"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Cabbage Recipe Ideas &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you’ve mastered sautéing, it’s time to experiment with flavors. And you shouldn’t hesitate to try new things. “Cabbage tastes good with everything!” Fink enthuses. One of her favorite combinations is Savoy cabbage sautéed with butter, leeks and fresh thyme. She also recommends napa cabbage with ginger, garlic and a hint of oyster sauce. Contreras suggests using sautéed cabbage as a foundation for grain bowls by layering your favorite grain on top, followed by a mix of raw or roasted seasonal vegetables and any protein you like. Narins loves a simple dish of sautéed buttered cabbage with either whole caraway seeds or chopped fresh dill. And don’t forget the finishing touches! Contreras swears by adding a splash of cider vinegar at the end of the cooking process and topping it with pepitas or sunflower seeds for extra crunch. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although sautéing was the unanimous favorite, Fink still firmly believes that there’s no single best way to cook cabbage. She says, “It depends on the type of cabbage and the time of year." In the summer, she eats a ton of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/280654/jessicas-coleslaw/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;coleslaw&lt;/a&gt; and lightly steamed cabbage, and in the winter, she eats a lot more &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7873672/melting-cabbage/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;braised cabbage&lt;/a&gt; preparations or uses it in stir-fries or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/easy-cabbage-soup-recipes-to-make-8736484" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;soups&lt;/a&gt;. Whether you’re using Savoy, napa, red or green cabbage, a simple sauté can transform this humble vegetable into something spectacular. Just remember these key takeaways: use a large pan, maintain proper heat control and don’t forget to season.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides its versatility, it’s also nutritious and budget-friendly, offering excellent bang for your buck. Just 1 cup of cabbage can provide 44% of our recommended Daily Value of vitamin C and 76% of vitamin K.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s also low in calories and naturally fat-free and may be preventive against &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-cabbage-8557536#toc-health-benefits-of-cabbage" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a number of chronic conditions&lt;/a&gt;, from cancer to heart disease. With a little know-how, cabbage can go from being boring “elevator music” to a starring role on your dinner table.

One of its earliest and most common signs is eye twitching, a symptom that many people ignore or attribute to stress or fatigue. So, how is magnesium linked to eye twitching?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/17/550x309/Eye_1765990855161_1765990858600.png" alt="5 silent signs like eye-twitching that you should never ignore today(Freepik)" title="5 silent signs like eye-twitching that you should never ignore today(Freepik)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/17/550x309/Eye_1765990855161_1765990858600.png" alt="5 silent signs like eye-twitching that you should never ignore today(Freepik)" title="5 silent signs like eye-twitching that you should never ignore today(Freepik)"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;5 silent signs like eye-twitching that you should never ignore today(Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Magnesium plays a crucial role in calming nerve activity and relaxing muscles. When levels drop, nerves can become overstimulated, leading to involuntary eyelid muscle spasms. Factors such as stress, lack of sleep, caffeine intake, and dry eyes may worsen the condition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;According to the National Library of Medicine, long-term and severe magnesium deficiency has also been associated with nystagmus, a condition marked by involuntary eye movements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts emphasize that food should be the first approach to correcting a magnesium deficiency, with supplements considered only when dietary intake falls short. Magnesium-rich foods include nuts, legumes, soy products, whole grains, and fruits such as bananas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, timing, quantity, and individual health conditions matter. Explaining this further, dietician Vidhi Chawla, founder of Aesthetic Nutrition Clinic, tells &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.healthshots.com/" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Health Shots"&gt;Health Shots&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;span&gt;"Magnesium deficiency rarely announces itself loudly, but the body always leaves clues. Recognising these early signs and correcting them through diet and mindful supplementation can prevent long-term complications and restore overall balance."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Importance of magnesium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Magnesium is one of the important minerals that your body needs, as it supports the biochemical and cellular processes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Magnesium acts as a cofactor in more than 300 enzymatic reactions that help to produce and use cellular energy (ATP), synthesize proteins and nucleic acids (DNA/RNA), and regulate ion channels that control nerve signaling and muscle function, says PubMed Central.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plus, as per the dietician, magnesium supports:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Normal muscle and nerve function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Energy production and metabolism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Blood pressure and blood sugar regulation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bone health and vitamin D activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stress response and sleep quality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;5 silent signs of magnesium deficiency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A dietitian shares a few signs you must not ignore that may indicate &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/health/struggling-to-sleep-nutritionist-suggests-magnesium-rich-foods-to-improve-sleep-naturally-101764350197903.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="magnesium"&gt;magnesium &lt;/a&gt;deficiency:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eye-twitching or muscle spasm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is the earliest sign that indicates the lack of magnesium in the body. On the other hand, magnesium relaxes muscles; low levels can cause involuntary twitching, especially around the eyes or calves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Frequent headaches or migraines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Low levels of magnesium may affect blood vessel function and neurotransmitter balance, triggering tension headaches or migraines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Poor sleep or restlessness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Magnesium supports GABA, which is a calming neurotransmitter. The lack of magnesium causes difficulty falling asleep or non-restorative sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mood changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deficiency of magnesium causes irritability, changes in mood, or heightened stress sensitivity, which can be linked to inadequate magnesium intake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;How much magnesium do I need?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the National Institutes of Health , magnesium requirements vary by age and sex. Adult men typically need 400–420 mg per day, while adult women require 310–320 mg. Pregnant women need about 350–360 mg daily, and breastfeeding women require 310–320 mg of magnesium per day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: The dietician says to be mindful of the intake of magnesium and also consult a doctor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Who is at risk?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A dietitian says that magnesium deficiency is more common than assumed, especially among:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;People with high stress levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those who consume highly processed diets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Individuals with diabetes or insulin resistance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;People with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/persistent-digestive-issues-in-children-study-reveals-it-may-hint-at-this-neurodevelopmental-disorder-101758555408286.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="digestive issues"&gt;digestive issues&lt;/a&gt; (IBS, poor absorption).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Excessive caffeine or alcohol consumption.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Athletes and people who sweat heavily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Magnesium-rich foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Almonds, cashews, peanuts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Spinach, amaranth, methi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whole grains (brown rice, millets, oats)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dark chocolate (70%+)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bananas and avocados&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Consistent intake through food is the safest and most sustainable approach, says the dietician.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Magnesium supplementation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The dietician says that if symptoms persist despite a balanced diet, supplementation may be considered under professional guidance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Types recommended: Magnesium glycinate or citrate (better absorption, gentler on the gut)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;When to take: Evening or before bed, especially if sleep or muscle cramps are concerns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Caution: Excess supplementation can cause diarrhea, low blood pressure, or interactions with medications.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When we think about the perfect ingredients to add to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/20-cozy-soup-recipes-that-are-like-a-warm-hug-from-grandma-8741214" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;warm, comforting bowl of soup&lt;/a&gt;, we often think of onions, celery or garlic. While those are great additions, flavorful spices, such as ginger, are often overlooked. Commonly used in desserts and teas, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7561449/health-benefits-of-turmeric-ginger/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;ginger is also a potent anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; agent that can elevate your soups in both flavor and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290281/health-benefits-of-ginger/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fresh ginger is the most common form used in soups. Its sharp and slightly spicy flavor pairs well with a variety of savory ingredients. You can grate or finely chop fresh ginger and add it early in the cooking process to allow its flavor to fully infuse the broth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ginger powder is another great option, especially if you want a more concentrated flavor. It’s shelf-stable and can be used in a variety of recipes. When using, start with a small amount, and add more as desired. For those who enjoy a hint of sweetness, candied ginger can also be chopped and added to certain soup and salad recipes, providing a unique twist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ginger also pairs beautifully with root vegetables, chicken and even seafood, making it a versatile addition to a variety of soups, like the two described below.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It helps heal, defend and protect our bodies. Acute inflammation, such as swelling from a sprained ankle or a cut, is essential for recovery. However, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902105/stress-causing-inflammation-what-you-can-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, which occurs when the body’s inflammatory response is constantly active, can lead to serious health concerns like heart disease, arthritis and even some cancers. &lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

The foods we eat can either exacerbate inflammation or help reduce inflammation in the body. For example, eating patterns &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292148/10-foods-you-should-avoid-according-to-registered-dietitians/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;high in sugar, processed foods and saturated fats&lt;/a&gt; can contribute to chronic inflammation. When consumed in excess, these foods and ingredients can increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are signaling molecules that promote inflammation in the body.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eating plenty of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-antioxidant-packed-foods-11813913" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;fruits, vegetables, seeds, nuts and spices&lt;/a&gt; such as ginger can help combat inflammation and improve your overall health.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-most-underrated-ingredient-for-holiday-baking-8762931" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Ginger is often used in a variety of recipes&lt;/a&gt; and teas and has been used for centuries in traditional medicine, due to its anti-inflammatory properties. These anti-inflammatory properties are attributed to the active compounds: gingerol, shogaol and paradol. These compounds are responsible for ginger’s distinct spicy flavor and have been shown to help reduce inflammation at a cellular level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gingerol is the most ginger-bioactive compound and is primarily responsible for its anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes, which are involved in the inflammation process.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This inhibition helps reduce swelling and pain, particularly in conditions like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shogaol and paradol are compounds that are formed when gingerol is cooked or dried. Both contribute to ginger’s ability to moderate inflammation by suppressing the production of nitric oxide, which is a molecule that can lead to chronic inflammation when produced in excess.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chronic inflammation has been linked to many common long-term health conditions, which is why everyday food choices matter. Ginger stands out as a practical anti-inflammatory ingredient because it’s easy to find, simple to use and supported by both traditional use and modern research. Adding small amounts of ginger regularly—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8024430/sick-day-noodle-soup/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;especially in soups and broths&lt;/a&gt;—can be a straightforward way to reduce inflammation without making major changes to your cooking routine.&lt;br&gt;
