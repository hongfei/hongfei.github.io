Health authorities recommend that adults eat at least two servings every week, equivalent to about eight ounces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YCXOXPAQCNEWHO47OKQ3UKNB4Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Yet &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;90 percent of U.S. adults&lt;/a&gt; eat so little seafood that they fall short of the recommendations. That’s not entirely surprising. Dietitians say that many people don’t know about the health benefits of eating seafood, or they may have concerns about the environmental impact and sustainability of commercial fishing. Some may be worried about exposure to mercury, a neurotoxin that’s found throughout the ocean and that can accumulate in fish. Others may be concerned about the costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CTTKX3GC5JETXAGCQERC6RAGQM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The seafood landscape can also be confusing.

The dietitians we spoke to said that as far as nutrition goes, both are great choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2XFZEK6VSBCJTJ7PFEWW2C24B4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Farmed salmon tends to be less expensive than wild salmon. But it does have some disadvantages. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666154320300375" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that the amount of omega-3s and mercury in farmed salmon &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25198598/" target="_blank"&gt;can vary widely&lt;/a&gt;, in part because it depends on what the fish were fed. Some types of farmed salmon are also farmed in ways that can be &lt;a href="https://www.seafoodwatch.org/recommendations/download-consumer-guides/national-consumer-guide" target="_blank"&gt;detrimental to the environment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GDT5544G4RCEVE5LU44OW6KPYI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While farmed salmon can certainly be a good choice, wild salmon is almost always the better option. “Wild salmon is a triple win because it’s high in good fats, low in mercury and sustainable,” said Sonya Lunder, the director of community science at the Natural Resources Defense Council and the author of a &lt;a href="https://static.ewg.org/reports/2016/mercury-in-seafood/EWG_MercuryinSeafood.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;report on seafood consumption&lt;/a&gt; and mercury exposure for&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the Environmental Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AV3G4UXJZBFUJIHDEFSVTNYVMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For affordable options, look for &lt;a href="https://wildplanetfoods.com/products/wild-sockeye-salmon" target="_blank"&gt;canned wild salmon&lt;/a&gt; and frozen &lt;a href="https://www.target.com/p/alaska-salmon-burgers-frozen-16oz-4ct-good-38-gather-8482/-/A-82032192?gQT=1" target="_blank"&gt;wild salmon burgers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/365-by-whole-foods-market-sockeye-salmon-fillet-32-oz-b07nrcrzff" target="_blank"&gt;fillets&lt;/a&gt; in the freezer section of your grocery store. Then try them out in quick and delicious recipes such as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/creamy-salmon-pasta/" target="_blank"&gt;Creamy Salmon Pasta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/quick-lentil-salmon-salad/" target="_blank"&gt;Lentil Salmon Salad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="KDY45QFUB5FRHLNZYJCCGQDXMI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="KDY45QFUB5FRHLNZYJCCGQDXMI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Sardines, anchovies and Atlantic mackerel&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5X25LBG2ZZG7XNYESDGAP6USLM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These small fish are a good choice for several reasons. Because they’re low on the food chain, they’re relatively low in mercury and other toxins (large predatory fish at the top of the food chain accumulate more contaminants). They’re high in protein and omega-3 fats. And they tend to be sustainable because they reproduce more rapidly than larger fish species, said Zeratsky at the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6XBCRAWIHBEHHIYGQH2UX22JDQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6XBCRAWIHBEHHIYGQH2UX22JDQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Rainbow trout&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LEJYN3Y2MZH2BPB3MY7K6YKONA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A single serving of rainbow trout contains more than an entire day’s worth of vitamin D and vitamin B12, as well as large amounts of omega-3 fats, protein and minerals. It has a mild flavor that makes it easy to use in a variety of dishes. It’s also a good choice for &lt;a href="https://www.seafoodwatch.org/seafood-basics/sustainable-healthy-fish/nutritious-rainbow-trout" target="_blank"&gt;environmental reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3NRH5EHAPNAWHC52UWPGPCOVF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And it’s relatively affordable. Just look for tinned rainbow trout and frozen rainbow trout fillets at your grocery store. One type of rainbow trout called steelhead actually looks and tastes a lot like salmon (and it usually costs less, too). If you’ve never cooked trout before, don’t be intimidated. Consider trying this simple recipe for &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/baked-lemon-trout-caper-salsa/" target="_blank"&gt;Baked Lemon Trout with Caper Salsa&lt;/a&gt;, or this one for &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/pecan-crusted-trout-brown-butter-herb-sauce/" target="_blank"&gt;Pecan-crusted Trout with Brown Butter Herb Sauce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="MICWIFS2VVDD5FEFW2ETKZD7X4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="MICWIFS2VVDD5FEFW2ETKZD7X4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Mussels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WSOFQLAMGBFIFF75RWG3S4LXP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Mussels are one of the unsung heroes of the seafood world. They’re packed with protein, omega-3 fats, iron, zinc and vitamin B12. They’re very low in mercury. You can usually buy them for between $5 and $10 a pound. And most of the mussels sold in stores and restaurants are farm-raised, which is environmentally sustainable. Mussels can also be &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2020/10/29/mussels-recipe-with-three-sauces/" target="_blank"&gt;surprisingly easy&lt;/a&gt; to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="TS7W4R6ECBHWBL5SUBMCDSMOVA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="TS7W4R6ECBHWBL5SUBMCDSMOVA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Oysters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FY3GS5ZEIBGB5HVSZRSZOGZSZ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Oysters are chock full of omega-3 fats, vitamins and minerals, and they’re very low in mercury. Most oysters consumed in the United States are farm-raised and cultivated in a way that &lt;a href="https://www.seafoodwatch.org/seafood-basics/sustainable-healthy-fish/oysters" target="_blank"&gt;benefits the environment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KD5LEWINKVHQHFHJY7PCS3KK7U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Raw oysters can carry potentially harmful bacteria.

These types of seafood are still nutritious and good sources of protein. But they’re not nearly as good a seafood option as, say, salmon or sardines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="ZXMY5JAKR5BMFPHB426I3ZEADU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="ZXMY5JAKR5BMFPHB426I3ZEADU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Tuna&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R73MAQPDDZECHKQQSRHKF6LJ5Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One of the benefits of tuna is that it’s high in omega-3 fats. But the downside is that some varieties contain a lot of mercury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JAZDT7SA2ZEA7KOSV3EP2WLW3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most of the tuna consumed in America is skipjack — a type of “light” tuna — followed by albacore tuna. Skipjack and other types of light tuna generally have less mercury than albacore. But the mercury content of light tuna can vary wildly. In 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/how-worried-should-you-be-about-mercury-in-your-tuna-a5041903086/" target="_blank"&gt;Consumer Reports analyzed mercury levels&lt;/a&gt; in many brands of canned tuna purchased at grocery stores and found that albacore tuna had on average three times as much mercury as canned light tuna. But some popular brands of light tuna had nearly as much mercury as albacore tuna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ANMTQQFEE5GYDIDLPWV6YEARYY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/how-worried-should-you-be-about-mercury-in-your-tuna-a5041903086/" target="_blank"&gt;Consumer Report’s safety experts&lt;/a&gt;, people who are pregnant should avoid eating canned tuna altogether and instead focus on consuming low-mercury fish. Other adults should consume no more than three servings of canned light tuna per week (about 12 ounces), or at most one serving of albacore tuna per week (four ounces).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S32RI6PSYFFC7EUI4HUC5HNY2I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Children should avoid albacore tuna and stick to canned light tuna, but they should have no more than about two servings per week.

								&lt;p&gt;Post-pandemic amnesia is a natural reaction, and it’s common for misremembering to occur after a pandemic or collective traumatic event occurs. Yet the reality is that SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/covid-19" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, is still finding ways to infect people by evolving new mutations, and a new variant has raised concern among virologists that continue to track the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;labeled&lt;/a&gt; the COVID variant NB.1.8.1 a “variant under monitoring” because it has been surging across Asia and made up 10.7% of global sequences reported as of mid-May. Now, the variant has been detected in the United States, Europe and Canada as well, concerning virus trackers who — for the first time since the &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/08/20/a-new-variant-nicknamed-pirola-is-raising-global-alarm-but-dont-freak-out-yet/" target="_blank"&gt;Pirola variant began circulating in August 2023&lt;/a&gt; — bestowed upon it a nickname: Nimbus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nimbus has recombined genetic material from other strains three times. Although the process of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/11/14/recombinant-strains-explainer/" target="_blank"&gt;recombination is a natural process&lt;/a&gt; of viruses trying to evolve to survive among the population, recombination events are concerning because each time a virus does so, it has the potential to evolve into something that is more infectious or causes more severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these mutations in Nimbus allows it to evade the immunity we have built against the virus from prior infections, so transmissibility might be slightly higher, said Dr. Rajendram Rajnarayanan, of the New York Institute of Technology campus in Jonesboro, Arkansas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1"&gt;preprint study&lt;/a&gt;, not yet peer-reviewed, found that the way this variant binds to cells could make it infect them more efficiently than earlier strains and that it could be easier for this strain to be passed along to someone else. However, there has not been any evidence yet to suggest that Nimbus is linked to more severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nimbus "is a strong candidate for the summer surge."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We haven’t seen a big surge in emergency departments due to COVID-related conditions and respiratory things in this term yet,” Rajnarayanan told Salon in a video call. “We have to wait and watch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, many people have been reporting a symptom called “razor blade throat,” but it’s unclear if this is a symptom of COVID or one of the many other viruses circulating. Overall, it is difficult to attribute certain symptoms to variants when there are more than a dozen circulating at a time and testing remains relatively low compared to earlier stages of the pandemic, said Dr. T. Ryan Gregory, an evolutionary and genome biologist at the University of Guelph in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That said, we learned from &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/05/02/as-mutates-the-vaccine-goalpost-has-shifted-to-preventing-severe-illness-and/" target="_blank"&gt;Omicron&lt;/a&gt; that high transmissibility can cause as much damage as high per infection virulence, and at this point it is not just acute severity that is of concern, but longer-term impacts of repeated infection,” Gregory told Salon in an email. Such impacts include conditions like "&lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/08/13/long-is-devastating-and-far-from-rare-as-infections-rise-again-why-are-we-still-ignoring-it/" target="_blank"&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;," in which the symptoms of COVID last for months or years, often disabling patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, current data shows that most COVID infections in the U.S. are &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt;currently caused by the LP.8.1 variant&lt;/a&gt;, which descends from Pirola. Both of these strains are technically still in the WHO’s Greek letter “Omicron” family, which now contains thousands of offspring. If there's one thing viruses are good at, it's mutating into new forms that can evade our immunity, whether that's from vaccines or past infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the WHO decided to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/updated-working-definitions-and-primary-actions-for--sars-cov-2-variants" target="_blank"&gt;only name variants with this system if they were considered a “variant of concern”&lt;/a&gt; and stated that certain action steps should be taken by countries if a variant fell under this classification. However, the agency has not labeled any variants like this since Omicron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/covid-variant-namer-gregory-6e8e9d3d"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; that some variants have been different enough to warrant a new name, and that not naming variants makes it more difficult to distinguish between the complex alphabet soup of variants that are circulating at any given time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Pirola, which included the BA.2.86 variant along with its descendants, was about as genetically different from the original Omicron strain as Omicron was from the original “wild strain” virus from Wuhan, China. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in the past two years, “it’s largely been the Pirola show,” Gregory said. Current vaccines have been designed to protect against this strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, Nimbus is not very common in the U.S., but it has been identified in California and has enough mutations in its spike protein that it has a potential to cause waves of illness in other regions — which is in part why it was designated a name. At-home tests should still work to detect this variant, but PCR tests that doctors can order are more accurate. Masking also helps prevent the spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year following the start of the COVID pandemic, cases have surged in the summer. Last year's summer surge hit around August and was so intense that &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/08/22/is-getting-so-bad-new-vaccines-were-given-early-approval/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccines were approved slightly early&lt;/a&gt;. Although this year's summer wave hasn't yet started, experts predict we will likely experience another wave this summer. As it stands, variant trackers expect either Nimbus or another variant called XFG to be the dominant strain this time around. Although XFG currently makes up a greater proportion of cases in North America than NB.1.8.1, the latter has been &lt;a href="https://www.syracuse.com/coronavirus/2025/06/new-covid-variant-in-ny-what-to-know-about-symptoms-cases-vaccines.html" target="_blank"&gt;detected in New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-05-30/a-new-covid-subvariant-spreads-rapidly-as-trump-pivots-away-from-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“NB.1.8.1 is a strong candidate for the summer surge,” Rajnarayanan said. “Yet what we know from previous instances is that it doesn't have to be a single variant that pushes up [to prominence] and sometimes it can be a group of variants … that pick up mutations from each other and recombine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Nimbus is still similar enough to the Pirola variants that the available vaccines were designed to target. That means they should still be effective, Gregory said. However, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-picks-new-strain-fall-covid-vaccines-means-shot-rcna208726"&gt;concerns have been raised&lt;/a&gt; that vaccine access may be limited this fall due to the Food and Drug Administration announcing it would require drugmakers to conduct a new set of clinical trials before approving new vaccines for use. Last month, the FDA also said it will &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/fda-significantly-limits-covid-19-vaccine-recommendations" target="_blank"&gt;only recommend&lt;/a&gt; COVID vaccines for adults 65 and older and those at risk for severe illness. Critics have said this will only make the vaccines &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/post/covid-19-vaccine-what-know-new-trump-policy-limits/16488196/" target="_blank"&gt;less likely to be covered by insurance&lt;/a&gt; and less available overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy announced he was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112"&gt;firing the expert panel&lt;/a&gt; that advises the Centers for Disease Control responsible for making recommendations on vaccines, further complicating matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paired with updated guidelines from the CDC that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413179/covid-vaccine-children-pregnant-rfk-cdc"&gt;drop recommendations for healthy pregnant women and kids&lt;/a&gt; to routinely get vaccinated, these changes from the federal government could have a chilling effect that leads fewer people to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m concerned about accessibility,” Rajnarayanan said, adding that it’s not clear if vaccines will be available to people without insurance that aren’t included in federal recommendations. “These kinds of things are still murky and I really want to see clearer guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many people may seem to have forgotten about COVID, people are still routinely hospitalized and killed by the virus. Additionally, each COVID nfection carries a risk of going on to develop long Covid, which continues to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/health/long-covid-world.html"&gt;debilitate millions of people&lt;/a&gt;. As we witnessed when COVID was a full-blown pandemic, emerging viruses can be especially damaging for people with existing conditions like diabetes, obesity and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to protect against things like long COVID not only for the well-being of people today but also for our susceptibility to future viruses, Rajnarayanan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In different parts of the world, I’ve seen funding for continuous surveillance gone down, and not just for surveillance, which is important, but also studying the disease itself,” Rajnarayanan said. “This is not just about protecting [people] today but also protecting them from any other variant in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

It formed about 11,000 years ago when a fist of magma punched up into the rolling hills of central France,  creating a volcano that spilled out lava before going dormant just a few hundred years later. For the past twenty years or so, a weather station on top of Puy de Dôme has been equipped with air samplers. The mountain is so high that clouds regularly blanket its peak, allowing scientists to capture some of the life they ferry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Studies led by Pierre Amato, an aerobiologist at the nearby University of Clermont Auvergne, have revealed that every millimeter of cloud water floating over Puy de Dôme &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182869" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;contains as many as 100,000 cells&lt;/a&gt;. Their DNA has revealed that some belong to familiar species, but many &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1186847/full" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;are new to science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Scientists who use DNA to identify species are perpetually anxious about contamination, and Amato is no exception. A hawk soaring over Puy de Dôme might fly over Amato's tubes and shake microbes off its feathers, for example. In Amato's laboratory, a graduate student may exhale germs into a test tube. Over the years, Amato has rejected thousands of potential species, suspicious that he or his students have inadvertently smeared skin microbes onto the equipment. But they have confidently discovered over &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182869" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;28,000 species of bacteria in clouds&lt;/a&gt;, and over 2,600 species of fungi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Amato and other scientists who study clouds suspect that they may be particularly good places for bacteria to survive – at least for some species. "Clouds are environments open to all, but where only some can thrive," Amato and a team of colleagues wrote in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;In a cloud, each microbe exists in perfect solitude, trapped in its own droplet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For bacteria, a cloud is like an alien world, dramatically different from the habitats where they usually live on land or at sea. Bacteria typically crowd together. In rivers they may grow into microbial mats. In our guts, they form dense films. But in a cloud, each microbe exists in perfect solitude, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809510001791" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;trapped in its own droplet&lt;/a&gt;. That isolation means that cloud bacteria don't have to compete with each other for limited resources. But a droplet doesn't have much room to carry the nutrients microbes need to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Yet Amato and his colleagues have found evidence that some microbes can indeed grow in clouds. In one study, the researchers compared samples they gathered from clouds on Puy de Dôme to others they collected on the mountain on clear days. The researchers looked for clues to their activity by comparing the amount of DNA in their samples to the amount of RNA. Active, growing cells will make a lot of copies of RNA from their DNA in order to produce proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers found that the ratio of RNA to DNA was &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/22/1257/2025/bg-22-1257-2025.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;several times higher in clouds than in clear air&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful clue that cells thrive in clouds. They also found that bacteria in clouds switch on genes essential for metabolising food and for growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To understand how these bacteria can thrive in clouds, the researchers have reared some of the species they've captured in their lab and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.authorea.com/users/908355/articles/1282315-phototrophy-improves-the-aerial-fitness-in-a-photoheterotrophic-methylobacterium-isolated-from-clouds?commit=70193b6f3a38a6c671ea5ac75784f75905678b22" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;then sprayed them into atmospheric simulation chambers&lt;/a&gt;. One kind of microbe, known as &lt;i id="methylobacterium" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;Methylobacterium&lt;/i&gt;, uses the energy in sunlight to break down organic carbon inside cloud droplets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Findings such as these suggest that the aerobiome is a force to be reckoned with – one that exerts a powerful influence on the chemistry of the atmosphere.

The ice then falls back down. If the air near the ground is cold, it may land as snow. If it is warm, it turns to rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It can be surprisingly hard for ice to form in a frigid cloud. Even at temperatures far below the freezing point, water molecules can remain liquid. One way to trigger the formation of ice, however, is to give them a seed of impurity. As water molecules stick to a particle's surface, they bond to one another, a process known as nucleation. Other water molecules then lock onto them and assemble into a crystal structure, which when heavy enough, will fall out of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It turns out that biological molecules and cell walls are exceptionally good at triggering rain. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140407" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Fungi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/aem.01850-20" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;algae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/5/4/044015/meta" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;pollen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bioone.org/journals/lindbergia/volume-38/issue-1/linbg.01070/Ubiquity-of-ice-nucleation-in-lichen--possible-atmospheric-implications/10.25227/linbg.01070.full" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lichens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2003JD003545" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/18/4431/2021/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/10/12/786" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;seed ice in clouds&lt;/a&gt;.

As the wind blows the bacteria off the plants and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.44.5.1059-1063.1982" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lofts them into the air&lt;/a&gt;, they rise into clouds overhead.

The plants use the water to grow more leaves, and the leaves support more bacteria, which rise into the sky and spur clouds to rain down even more water to nurture life below.

Venus, for example, has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead. But the clouds that blanket Venus &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://science.nasa.gov/venus/venus-facts/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;are much cooler&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps able to sustain life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lhdmjj.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Pseudomonas bacteria are commonly found in the soil and on plants, but they may be particularly well adapted as the seeds for ice formation (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Pseudomonas bacteria are commonly found in the soil and on plants, but they may be particularly well adapted as the seeds for ice formation (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sara Seager, an astrobiologist at MIT, has speculated that life might have arisen on the surface of Venus early in its history, when it was cooler and wetter. As the planet heated up, some microbes &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2020.2244" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;could have found refuge in the clouds&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of sinking back to the surface, they may have bobbed up and down in the atmosphere, riding currents for millions of years, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Thinking about Seager's alien aerobiome can make cloud-gazing even more enjoyable. But when we look at clouds, Amato's research has revealed, we are also looking up at our own influence on the world. When Amato and his colleagues have surveyed the genes in the microbes they capture, they find a remarkable number that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161264" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;endow bacteria with resistance to antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Down on the ground, we humans have spurred the widespread evolution of these resistance genes. By taking excessive amounts of penicillin and other drugs to fight infections, we favour mutants that can withstand them. Making matters worse, farmers feed antibiotics to chickens, pigs and other livestock in order to get them to grow to bigger sizes. In 2014 alone, 700,000 people died worldwide from infections of antibiotic‑resistant bacteria. Five years later, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;toll rose to 1.27 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The evolution of antibiotic resistance occurs within the bodies of humans and the animals humans eat. The bacteria endowed with this resistance then escape their nurseries and make their way through the environment – into the soil, into streams, and it turns out, even into the air. Researchers have found high levels of resistance genes in the bacteria &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-021-01197-5" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;floating through hospitals&lt;/a&gt; and around &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412023000247" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;pig farms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lhdmk3.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Winds can carry dust and microbes over hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Winds can carry dust and microbes over hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But airborne resistance genes can waft even further. An international team of scientists inspected the filters in automobile air conditioners in nineteen cities around the world. The filters had captured a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b02204" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;rich diversity of resistant bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. It appears, in other words, that resistance genes float through cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In recent years, Amato and his colleagues have charted even longer journeys. In a 2023 survey of clouds, they reported finding bacteria carrying &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722083681" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;29 different kinds of resistance genes&lt;/a&gt;.  A single airborne bacterium may carry as many as nine resistance genes, each providing a different defense against the drugs. Every cubic metre of cloud, they estimated, held up to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722083681" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;10,000 resistance genes&lt;/a&gt;. A typical cloud floating overhead may hold more than a trillion of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Amato and his colleagues speculate that clouds hold such a high number of resistance genes because they can help the bacteria survive there. Some genes provide antibiotic resistance by allowing bacteria to pump the drugs out of their interiors quickly, getting rid of them before they can cause damage. The stress of life in a cloud may cause bacteria to produce toxic waste that they need to pump out quickly as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Clouds may be able to spread these resistance genes farther than contaminated meat and water. Once in a cloud, bacteria can travel hundreds of miles in a matter of days before seeding a raindrop and falling back to Earth. When they reach the ground, the microbes may then pass along their resistance genes to other microbes they encounter. Every year, Amato and his colleagues estimate, 2.2 trillion trillion resistance genes &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://cnrs.hal.science/hal-04300300v1/document" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;shower down from the clouds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is a sobering thought to hold in one's mind on a walk through the rain.

And that’s not a healthy strategy, said Alison Brown, a nutrition researcher at the National Institutes of Health. Diets like these can cause you to miss out on the range of nutrients your body requires, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A much better way to maintain healthy eating habits, she added, is to focus on foods that are not only nourishing, but also bring you joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That can be challenging when nutrition fads are coming and going with seemingly increasing speed, and often conflicting advice.

Prioritize whole foods.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Not all processed foods are unhealthy, but they’re often stripped of beneficial nutrients like fiber and certain vitamins and minerals, Dr. Brown said. And they may contain high levels of ingredients that can be harmful to health, like added sugars and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/19/well/eat/sodium-salt-diet.html" title=""&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Because of this, it’s best to consume foods “as close as possible to how they exist in nature,” Dr. Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

In one case, a patient refused transfusion from the standard donor pool — insisting on receiving only blood from unvaccinated individuals — and ultimately experienced severe complications during surgery due to delayed transfusion, despite multiple consults and clear explanations that vaccination status has no impact on blood safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These encounters underscore the growing challenge of misinformation and the ethical tension between respecting autonomy and protecting patients from preventable harm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The safety of the blood supply in the United States and other high-income countries relies on rigorous donor selection and laboratory-based donor testing. The policies, processes, and practices have been refined over decades to ensure both optimal safety and sufficiency of the blood supply. There is overwhelming evidence that anonymous, voluntary donors pose the lowest risk to transfusion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet requests for directed blood donation — blood donated by a specific donor for a specific recipient — have increased since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. These requests most commonly arise from patients or parents who want blood from “unvaccinated” donors. My colleagues and I (an international team of transfusion specialists, ethicists, legal experts, and public health researchers) examined this development in a paper published in &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00815" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. We found that these requests, though often framed as personal preference, raise significant ethical, medical, and logistical concerns that challenge the safety, equity, and integrity of the blood supply.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Directed blood donation is not new. In the early 1980s, shortly after the discovery of HIV and prior to the availability of tests for the virus, some patients made requests for relatives or friends to donate, assuming that they would be safer than community blood donors. Advances in donor screening, infectious-disease testing, and blood processing have since rendered standard donations extraordinarily safe, and directed donation declined. Covid-19 prompted a resurgence in requests, given concerns from some people regarding harmful effects of then-nascent mRNA vaccines. National utilization data show an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10543447/#:~:text=Of%20the%2010%2C764%2C000%20units%20transfused,units)%20were%20for%20autologous%20transfusions." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;11% increase in directed-donor transfusions from 2019 to 2021&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. That is the most recent year for which peer-reviewed data are available, but anecdotally, it seems that this trend has continued or even increased.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;While there are no licensed tests that can reliably determine whether a donor has been vaccinated against Covid-19, directed donation and “unvaccinated blood” have been promoted by some groups, prompting legislators in several U.S. states to introduce bills that could require hospitals to honor such requests. None of those proposals has become law, but the debate has drawn public attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many people assume that directed donations are inherently safer, or that receiving blood from a relative increases the likelihood of a better outcome from transfusion. However, this is not supported by evidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, directed donors are often first-time or infrequent donors. Because of this, they are more likely to pose risks to blood safety. Large studies cited in our review indicate that first-time parental donors have higher rates of markers for transfusion-transmissible infections than community donors (8.6% vs. 1.1% in one series). A likely reason is social pressure: People donating for someone they know may not disclose high-risk behaviors on the donor history questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, when a donor is a relative, partial genetic matching can — perhaps surprisingly — increase the risk of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD), a rare but often fatal complication. To prevent TA-GVHD, cellular blood components from related donors must be irradiated, which reduces the shelf life of the donated blood and adds cost. Mother-to-child donations elevate the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury, and transfusions between reproductive partners can lead to immune responses that can harm future pregnancies by attacking the fetus’s red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are other problems with directed donations. Every directed unit must be collected, labeled, and stored separately. If the intended patient ultimately does not need the blood, the unit may be discarded because it was kept out of routine inventory rotation. Directed donations cannot be mobilized quickly in emergencies; the blood may arrive too late or in insufficient quantity for patients with large transfusion requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, extensive surveillance has found no difference in outcomes between recipients of blood from vaccinated versus unvaccinated donors. Because directed donation introduces additional infectious and logistic risks without offsetting medical advantages, our group concluded that it should be reserved for rare, medically justified situations such as patients with rare blood types and/or multiple antibodies, both of which may pose challenges for procurement of blood from community (i.e., random) blood donors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So what should doctors do with a patient insisting on “unvaccinated blood”?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the ethical principle of autonomy argues that we as physicians provide patients the ability to make their own decisions, it does not obligate health care providers to provide non-evidence-based or potentially harmful products or interventions, which is what our analysis argues that directed donations are. As such, if the patient outright refuses any other blood product, that is their prerogative, but physicians should not acquiesce to provide a directed or Covid-19 vaccine negative unit to meet their needs, as there are no data that supports the efficacy of this product — but numerous data suggest it is more harmful.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blood is a limited, life-saving resource. Policies that allocate it are designed to balance autonomy, safety, and equity. Granting non-medical donor preferences can unintentionally undermine that balance:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equity: Allowing one preference may legitimize another, even if not health-related; examples include requests based on race or gender.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Public trust: Segregating blood on grounds that are not supported by evidence could imply that standard blood is inferior, eroding confidence in established safety measures.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Supply strain: Redirecting donors toward specific recipients reduces the community pool and can exacerbate shortages, particularly during crises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Our analysis recommends that health systems and policymakers continue to prioritize anonymous, need-based allocation and decline directed donation requests that lack medical necessity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transfusion services in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand have reported similar inquiries about unvaccinated blood. Many patients accept explanations once they learn how universal screening works, though a subset remain concerned. To date, professional bodies such as the Canadian Blood Services and the New Zealand Blood Service have maintained policies that disallow non-medically indicated directed donations, reinforcing consistency across systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the political climate and ubiquity of misinformation, I suspect that requests for unvaccinated blood will continue apace or even increase. But clear patient-centered communication and transparent publishing of safety data have historically reduced unwarranted fears about blood transfusion. The key is sustained, fact-based engagement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That kind of engagement requires:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plain language: Clinicians should explain that blood banks do not record vaccination status and that strict testing and donor deferral using the donor history questionnaire makes blood that is donated by anonymous community donors safe for transfusion.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Clear institutional policy: Hospitals should have consistent procedures for handling directed-donation requests, including medical-director review and documentation of informed refusal if a patient declines standard blood.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Professional alignment: National and international societies can issue statements affirming that non-evidence-based directed donation is discouraged, providing clinicians with an authoritative reference.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Legislative outreach: Sharing data with policymakers before new bills are drafted can help avert well-intended but impractical mandates that could compromise safety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Directed blood donation occupies a small corner of transfusion practice, but a visible one. By discussing the risks and lack of benefit more clearly with patients, I hope that we can uphold public confidence in our rigorously tested donor system.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists want those later decades to feel less like overtime and more like prime time, so they are probing ways to postpone the biological slide that usually accelerates after age 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One avenue getting serious attention swaps crash diets for chemistry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-caloric-restriction-help-you-live-longer-its-complicated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cutting calories&lt;/a&gt; without malnutrition stretches the life of mice, worms, and even rhesus monkeys, but sticking to that routine is tough and can cause dizziness, brittle bones, and hair thinning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are hunting for pills that give the same benefits while letting dinner stay on the plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-importance-of-aging-research"&gt;Importance of aging research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging drives most top killers – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/morning-coffee-drinkers-have-a-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-scientist-discovers-that-common-non-cancer-drugs-when-combined-can-kill-cancer-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dementia-was-extremely-rare-in-ancient-times-so-why-is-it-now-so-prevalent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; – by pushing cells toward dysfunction. Delaying the underlying process could reduce the burden of several conditions at once instead of treating each separately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health economists note that trimming even a few years off late-life disability would save billions in care costs and lift quality of life for millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most drug discovery still targets single diseases, yet a growing field called geroscience treats aging itself as the root cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caloric-restriction mimetics, or CRMs, sit high on the wish list because they tap into &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/intermittent-fasting-slows-aging-by-boosting-cell-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolic circuits&lt;/a&gt; that animals already use to survive lean times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When those circuits turn on, cells tidy up damaged proteins, improve energy use, and bolster stress defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-caloric-restriction-and-its-hurdles"&gt;Caloric restriction and its hurdles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dietary-restriction-slows-brain-aging-and-increases-lifespan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;caloric restriction&lt;/a&gt; usually means eating 20–40 percent fewer calories than normal for years on end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence in rodents is striking, but people find the regimen unsustainable, and severe energy cuts can weaken immunity. A safer strategy aims to flip the same molecular switches with medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computational screening tools now search drug libraries for compounds that make human cells mimic the gene-expression profile seen under calorie shortfall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach is faster than testing each molecule in live animals first and often highlights drugs already approved for other conditions, cutting years off the path to clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rilmenidine-common-pill-fights-aging"&gt;Rilmenidine – common pill fights aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One surprising hit from these searches is rilmenidine, a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/rilmenidine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypertension medicine&lt;/a&gt; taken by mouth for three decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After machine-learning models flagged it, a team led by molecular biogerontologist João Pedro Magalhães at the &lt;a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Birmingham UK&lt;/a&gt; put it to the test in &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;, a small soil worm favored by aging researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the first time, we have been able to show in animals that rilmenidine can increase lifespan,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same trial delivered another bonus: older worms benefited almost as much as young ones, hinting that humans would not need to start treatment in middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug’s safety record also helps. Doctors prescribe rilmenidine worldwide for high blood pressure, and side effects are rare and relatively mild: they include palpitations, insomnia, and drowsiness in a few cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Magalhães noted, “We are now keen to explore if rilmenidine may have other clinical applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-rilmenidine-acts-inside-cells"&gt;How rilmenidine acts inside cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rilmenidine binds to imidazoline receptors, tiny docking stations on cell membranes that regulate metabolism. In worms, one receptor called &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Characterization-of-NISH-1_fig1_355334171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nish-1&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be essential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the lifespan-extending effects of rilmenidine were abolished when nish-1 was deleted,” the research team explained. They then re-introduced the receptor gene. Rescuing the nish-1 receptor reinstated the increase in lifespan after treatment with rilmenidine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings outline a clear pathway for future drug tweaks aimed at boosting potency or reducing any unwanted effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downstream from nish-1, the treated worms ramped up autophagy – the cell’s waste-disposal system – and tolerated heat stress better than untreated peers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither developmental timing nor fertility shifted, suggesting the drug targeted aging pathways rather than growth or reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-across-species"&gt;Testing across species&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rna-junk-is-crucial-for-human-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shares many genes&lt;/a&gt; with humans, yet researchers need data from mammals before moving to people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Birmingham group therefore fed rilmenidine to mice and saw gene-expression changes in liver and kidney tissue that matched the classic caloric-restriction signature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood biomarkers of metabolism shifted toward youthful levels, reinforcing the idea that the pill taps into ancient survival programs conserved across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the compound is already approved, early-phase human trials could focus directly on biological markers such as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-loss-has-a-greater-impact-on-heart-health-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt;, insulin sensitivity, and muscle strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rilmenidine’s oral delivery is a practical advantage over drugs that require injections or special diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-of-rilmenidine-and-anti-aging"&gt;Future of rilmenidine and anti-aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer human studies must still rule out subtle harms and confirm that improved markers translate into healthier years. Even so, experts see momentum building. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With a global aging population, the benefits of delaying aging – even if slightly – are immense,” Magalhães said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators will need fresh guidelines for drugs that target aging rather than a diagnosed disease, and ethicists are debating fair access. Yet the prospect of taking a small daily tablet instead of counting every calorie is hard to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If rilmenidine or similar compounds keep proving safe and effective, the next generation of seniors may find that staying healthy deep into their eighties feels less like luck and more like routine science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 22:46:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQR1FveUFHRGozV2FrcTBKNURmRDRwdmlMMWpBaU1Ockw3VnNRWlBTS28xSnhlRkZVQTN3ZFUzZWNVOXFYT2QwTm1zOElqWndNNHN2RDI1NGlhYTZEVEowRXRuT3BkSkZkRXhJeFNsZi1FWFgxcjBIMVFrLU9jMFE0UkJDRk44WnBZQ0FhdG9UUEQ3R05IMHVNd1hkNTZiUXE1VnVURGpRNUt4Tm9PX3RoVUV3</guid></item><item><title>人们现在正在报告令人恐惧的COVID症状—以下是须知事项- Yahoo!

Obviously, one in the fall to prevent the winter increase, but another right now in order to help prevent serious disease during the late summer and early fall,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;This goes for people 65 and older, younger people with underlying chronic medical conditions and pregnant people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;“The recommendation is take special precautions and get that extra dose, because if we get infected ... we get that extra protection and to help keep us out of the hospital,” Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Wearing a mask in indoor spaces, social distancing, washing your hands often and increasing ventilation when possible are more ways to protect yourself from COVID and other respiratory viruses, too, said Burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you do get sick, there are treatments available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative col-body mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-[0.875rem]/[1.25rem] mt-1  line-clamp-2 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Oleg Breslavtsev / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;If you have any COVID symptoms, such as sore throat, fatigue, cough or fever, take a test to see if you have COVID. If you are infected, get in touch with your doctor, particularly if you’re high-risk as there are treatments available, said Schaffner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;It’s important that you talk to your primary care provider as the guidance will vary depending on your age, underlying conditions and other risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;COVID is a miserable infection, Horn added. “Over-the-counter meds help — Ibuprofen alternating with Tylenol, if you’re able to take those ... there’s no reason to be miserable,” Horn said. “So, take the medicine that you are able to take to help,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;It’s also important to stay hydrated when you’re sick even if you do have a painful sore throat. A sore throat can make hydration feel like more of a chore, but it’s important to drink water and herbal teas as dehydration can further irritate the dry membranes in your throat, Horn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;“If you are sick, it’s best to keep your germs to yourself,” said Horn. This means canceling the dinner plans, not going to the party and calling out of work if you can — if you can’t, wearing a tight-fitting mask is key, Horn added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;“Preventing transmission is the biggest thing that we can do to help keep everybody healthy,” Horn said.&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/razor-sore-throat-painful-covid-symptom_l_6846f28ee4b0bf9944bd1061" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/fabianabuontempo/things-women-do-that-make-men-feel-giddy?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;It's Nice To Feel Wanted&amp;quot;: Guys Are Sharing The Small Gestures Women Do That Make Them Weak At The Knees;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"It's Nice To Feel Wanted": Guys Are Sharing The Small Gestures Women Do That Make Them Weak At The Knees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahloewentheil/modern-trends-that-should-disappear?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;I Can't Wait For This To Go Out Of Style&amp;quot;: People Are Sharing Popular Modern Trends That Are Actually Pretty Toxic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"I Can't Wait For This To Go Out Of Style": People Are Sharing Popular Modern Trends That Are Actually Pretty Toxic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="col-body mb-4 leading-7 text-[18px] md:leading-8 break-words min-w-0"&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelblatt/love-life-died-signs-medium-essay?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I Was Devastated When The Love Of My Life Died.

And because it was on the schedule, insurance companies would pay and public health vaccine programs for lower-income kids would supply it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="PX01 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="27"&gt;When it comes to healthy pregnant women, they had always been included without being named, because pregnancy is one of the underlying health conditions that makes the vaccine important for adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="28"&gt;That didn’t change, said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="29"&gt;“Yes, providers are still carrying and offering this vaccine to their VFC-eligible patients,” said Georgia Department of Public Health spokesperson Nancy Nydam Shirek, speaking of the Vaccines for Children government vaccine supply program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="30"&gt;Rick Ward, a spokesperson for the Georgia Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, agreed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="31"&gt;“It hasn’t been taken out,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="33"&gt;The Georgia Office of the Commissioner of Insurance says they do not expect last month’s changes to affect private plans purchased on &lt;a href="https://georgiaaccess.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;Georgia Access&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;Shake-up underway&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="36"&gt;The public health landscape began shifting again Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="37"&gt;The scientists and doctors who draft the CDC immunization schedule, and who submit it to the CDC director, are called the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="38"&gt;Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, fired the entire membership of ACIP on Monday afternoon. He said he intends to replace them with members who have a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="39"&gt;“A clean sweep is necessary to reestablish public confidence in vaccine science,” Kennedy said in his statement. “ACIP new members will prioritize public health and evidence-based medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP04 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="41"&gt;ACIP members make their decisions in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;public meetings and debates that anyone can view&lt;/a&gt;. ACIP’s members have tended to be scientists with long careers in research or medical practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="42"&gt;The American Medical Association, the nation’s organization of doctors, said in a statement that Kennedy’s move would have the opposite effect from building confidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="44"&gt;“Today’s action to remove the 17 sitting members of ACIP undermines that trust and upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives,” the AMA statement said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="45"&gt;ACIP is currently scheduled to have its next meeting later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;How to choose a vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="47"&gt;In the mean time, parents and patients can always look at the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/presentation-slides-june-26-28-2024.html" target="_blank"&gt;public research&lt;/a&gt; and debates provided in past ACIP meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="49"&gt;Never saying a vaccine is perfect, ACIP members typically weigh whether getting a vaccine is safer than not getting the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="50"&gt;They have made decisions both ways. For some patients, ACIP has decided that risks of side effects tip the scale against getting the shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="51"&gt;For most pregnant women and their babies, the scale is on the side of getting the COVID-19 vaccine, ACIP decided. That’s because data suggests that not getting the vaccine could be more dangerous for both the fetus and the mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="52"&gt;There’s a higher rate of premature babies associated with moms who have COVID-19. In the Delta pandemic wave, there was a higher rate of stillbirths for babies of women who had COVID-19. Fetuses and newborns under 6 months cannot get the COVID-19 vaccine themselves, so they depend on getting it through their mom when she’s pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="54"&gt;As for the mothers themselves, pregnancy puts women at risk of blood conditions like preeclampsia and blood clots. And COVID-19 is actually a vascular disease — capable of producing dangerous blood problems like microclots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP04 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="56"&gt;Pregnancy and COVID-19 together can be even more dangerous. Research shows pregnant women who get COVID-19 are more likely to wind up in the ICU or die than are other people who get the disease, the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/" target="_blank"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="57"&gt;After calculating how many people are protected from COVID-19 by getting the vaccine, the ACIP members calculated that in general it’s safer for them to get it than not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="58"&gt;As of Sept. 24, the CDC’s webpage for pregnant women &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/pregnant-or-breastfeeding.html#:~:text=Everyone%20ages%206%20months%20and,pregnancy%20is%20safe%20and%20effective." target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: “If you are pregnant or were recently pregnant, you are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, compared to those who are not pregnant. Additionally, if you have COVID-19 during pregnancy, you are at increased risk of complications that can affect your pregnancy and your baby from serious illness from COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="59"&gt;When it comes to healthy children, ACIP members have recently seemed to be easing back on their support, said Schaffner, the Vanderbilt professor, who previously served as medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. He wouldn’t have been surprised to see the recommendation for healthy kids scaled back by ACIP members who lost their jobs Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AJC.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 20:21:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNdjlvM0d4TnRKQjhzWGR5aTUtWF9GZUhsRUNtLXJKd1M5c1lKZ1FqMXdMQXRycnVPc0ZQdGRUeUdMT3NVdzNMWTdENzh4bmUwcGpUbjhhR1A0dWU1VDducElIOVNwck9uQ1dXYXZVMHV3MnczUTFYN3k0WkFkNzh4TzNuWERZaEFTUUdtQUpiNFF4ZlRVUmpMbVM0T21KS3BtdEV3UWV3eml0ZjhKd0Rj</guid></item><item><title>年轻人喜爱的健康零食与突发中风、心脏病发作的风险惊人地联系在一起-每日邮报 | Health snacks loved by young people shockingly linked to risk of sudden strokes, heart attacks - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A popular sweetener used in protein bars and sugar-free energy drinks could raise your risk of suffering from a stroke, a study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/colorado/index.html" id="mol-45314800-45ff-11f0-9fd1-db64ee3096b4"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, Boulder, exposed human cells found in the brain to erythritol in amounts they claimed mirrored a diet soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cells showed worrying changes within hours, including a decrease in the amount of clot-busting proteins they released, which is key for preventing strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Auburn Berry, a graduate student who led the research, said: 'While erythritol is widely used in sugar-free products marketed as healthier alternatives, more research is needed to fully understand its impact on vascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In general, people should be conscious of the amount of erythritol they are consuming on a daily basis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes amid a mystery rise in strokes in young people, which have surged almost 15 percent among under-45s since 2011 — according to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-42e1e9b0-4613-11f0-b50c-2fb299611993"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Erythritol is a wildly popular sweetener, used in drinks including Vitaminwater Zero sugar, Monster Zero and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/arizona/index.html" id="mol-9eafa0a0-460b-11f0-9fd1-db64ee3096b4"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; Iced Tea, and in Quest protein bars. It is also found in the sweetener truvia, which is often added to coffee as a sugar replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the new study was small and used isolated cells, it adds to the growing body of evidence raising concern about the sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11798339/Artificial-low-calorie-sweetener-raise-heart-attack-stroke-risk.html"&gt;A 2023 Cleveland Clinic study&lt;/a&gt; tracked 4,000 people found those who consume erythritol were more likely to suffer a heart attack, stroke or early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Some popular products with Erythritol include zero sugar Monster energy drinks, Vitaminwater Zero sugar and some Quest protein bars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study was published in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025"&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers isolated human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells — cells that line blood vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After exposing them to erythritol for three hours in a lab, the researchers identified several damaging changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included the cells producing 75 percent more compounds that can damage them and surrounding tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And they also produced about 20 percent less of a compound used to help blood vessels relax, allowing more blood to flow through and minimizing the risk of a clot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also noted that erythritol decreased the production of a clot-busting protein called t-PA, which can dissolve clots and help prevent strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In their conclusion, they said the sweetener 'potentially contributes to [an] increased risk of ischemic stroke'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ischemic stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks a blood vessel in the brain, preventing blood and oxygen from reaching brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause brain cells to die within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Limitations of the study include that it was carried out in a lab outside the human body, which may not mirror internal conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, it was not clear how much of the sweetener is typically absorbed by these cells in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also exposed the cells to the equivalent of 30 grams of erythritol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The sweetner erythritol has been linked to a higher risk of stroke. It is used in VitaminWater products shown above&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It is also used in Monster Zero products&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers claimed this was 'equivalent to the typical amount... in an artificially sweetened beverage.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the stated amount of sweetener in the beverages typically falls below this threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, Monster Energy Zero contains about two grams of erythritol — according to consumer website &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/product/0070847015208/monster-energy-zero-ultra"&gt;Open Food Facts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile Vitaminwater says less than one percent of its 500 milliliter (ml) bottles contain erythritol, or less than five grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Quest protein bars also contain up to five grams of erythritol each, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.questnutrition.com/products/chocolate-brownie-protein-bar"&gt;company's website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Erythritol is about 70 percent as sweet as sugar but contains six percent of the calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be found in small amounts naturally in some foods, but in diet sodas is often made from processing corn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also isn't easily processed by the body, meaning it is often passed out through urine. Some may, however, be stored in the body — where its effects can build-up overtime. It was approved by the FDA as safe for foods in 2001&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study comes amid a concerning rise in strokes among young Americans, with previous work blaming this on increased stress, a more sedentary lifestyle and higher drug use than past generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Obesity, high cholesterol and diabetes also play a role — all three are more prevalent in young people today than historically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13723595/erythritol-sweetener-heart-attack-sugar-stroke-diet-keto.html"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; from last year, scientists also found that when people are given the sweetener erythritol, cells in their blood that cause clotting become more active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, they found the sweetener caused platelets in the blood to become activated and stick together, forming clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Now, he's coughing up blood, he gets taken to the ER and they do imaging and he has a complete white out on his lungs,' he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He then codes and dies,' he continued. 'He comes to the autopsy table and I find he does have a horrible &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-b9be0880-4612-11f0-b206-f15fdeb071ef"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; - one of the worst pneumonias I've ever seen in my career - but as I went through the lung I realized the reason why there was pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was because there was a cancerous tumor, a small cell carcinoma of the lung that was encasing the airway,' he explained. 'So what happens is it grows into the airway and closes the airway off and causes a pneumonia behind that, it's called the post obstructive pneumonia secondary to malignancy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In 2025, it is predicted that more than 600,000 people will die of cancer in the United States - but within that is a small number who don't even know they have it (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that pneumonia is not the cause of death, but the 'end point' of the actual underlying cause, which is cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Without the cancerous tumor blocking the airway, you wouldn't have had the pneumonia,' Dr. Wolfe explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor then listed another example with a younger patient, who was a man in his early 20s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[He had] had several months of abdominal pain, weight loss and fevers, also night sweats, and he refused to go to the doctor to investigate this.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Then the pain became so intense that he finally did go to the ER and they thought it was going to be some kind of appendicitis or ruptured organ,' the medical professional continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sadly, the young man didn't even make it to the CT scanner before he passed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He wasn't able to be revived,' he somberly recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the man was taken to Dr. Wolfe to perform an autopsy, he found him riddled with cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Wolfe, who has performed numerous autopsies to determine people's cause of death, recently posted a shocking TikTok sharing three stories from within the last few months (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I opened him up and found cancer in essentially every organ from his clavicles to his pelvis, also in the abdominal wall and the omentum [tissue that drapes over the intestines],' he recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor said it was a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma case, explaining: 'The tumor burden just gets so high it messes up the electrolytes for the patient and then they develop cardiac arrhythmia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last patient was a 65-year-old man who had colon cancer symptoms, but passed away before he could have a colonoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I [did] the autopsy to determine the cause of death and it turns out he did actually have stage four colon cancer that was metastatic widely throughout his abdomen, and also into his lungs and had basically grown through the wall of the colon,' he shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As per &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/how-long-can-you-have-cancer-without-knowing#takeaway"&gt;Healthline,&lt;/a&gt;

                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After nearly two decades of unsuccessful attempts to start a family, a couple at Columbia University Fertility Center has become the first to get pregnant thanks to a groundbreaking AI system designed to find even the rarest sperm. The couple, identified as 38-year-old Rosie and her husband, had spent nearly 19 years trying to conceive and underwent 15 unsuccessful IVF attempts, reports &lt;a href="https://time.com/7291154/doctors-report-first-pregnancy-new-ai-procedure/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They finally found success with a new technology that offers hope to those facing male infertility caused by azoospermia—a condition where no sperm is detectable in semen.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        The AI tool, called STAR (Sperm Track and Recovery), uses an algorithm paired with a fluidic chip that screens samples, searching for rare sperm cells invisible to even experienced embryologists. The approach, developed by Dr. Zev Williams and his team, &lt;a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/news/columbia-fertility-looks-stars-help-men-infertility"&gt;borrows from astrophysics&lt;/a&gt;, where AI scans for new stars among billions in the sky; here, it scans millions of cells for scarce sperm. Once found, the sperm can be preserved or used in fertilization. Prior to STAR, men with azoospermia had few options besides using donor sperm or trying invasive and sometimes risky procedures. For Rosie and her husband, STAR found sperm in samples where manual searches found none.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        "The embryologists really worked hard to find sperm, since they didn't want to be outshone by a machine," Williams tells &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;. "In one of the samples they analyzed for two days and found no sperm, STAR found 44 in an hour." Rosie's successful pregnancy in March 2025 did not require any extra IVF testing or steps. Sperm collected with STAR was used immediately to fertilize Rosie's eggs. Now four months along, Rosie reports the experience still feels unreal after years of disappointment. Dr. Williams sees broader potential for AI in tackling other infertility challenges, noting that it may reveal biological details previously missed.  (This content was created with the help of AI.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041459/fad-diets/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fad diets&lt;/a&gt; to trending ingredients, there are so many viral (and mostly problematic) moments in the nutrition space that we’re always keeping our eye on. And we’re not the only ones that are concerned about the internet’s infatuation for “cure-all health hacks.”.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On an episode of the &lt;em&gt;CAPS LOCK&lt;/em&gt; podcast, guest dietitian Vanessa Rissetto M.S., RD, CDN took the stage to debunk today’s biggest nutrition myths.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here’s what she notes to be the top four health red flags you should be wary of.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-carnivore-diet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Carnivore Diet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ah yes, the carnivore diet, AKA the theory that exclusively eating meat will help aid weight loss and muscle growth. If this sounds unrealistic, don’t worry: This dietitian has had enough of it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;getting enough protein&lt;/a&gt; in your diet is important, there’s a variety of protein sources that provide more nutritional value than red meat, like fatty fish, beans and legumes, tofu and nuts. And the dietitian does make a point that eating too much red meat is a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-to-limit-to-reduce-colon-cancer-risk-11694207" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;risk factor for colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Recent research shows a link between mutations in colon tumors and a diet that includes regular red and processed meat intake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, any food is OK in moderation, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7994363/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-red-meat-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; can provide a great source of vitamin B12 and iron, but anything in excess usually isn’t great for the body. Since this diet does not include fruits, vegetables and grains, there's a risk for nutrition deficiencies, constipation and more health concerns. A balanced eating pattern is the best kind!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-avoiding-nightshades"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Avoiding Nightshades &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7999760/what-are-nightshades-and-are-they-bad-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nightshades&lt;/a&gt; getting a bad rap isn’t anything new, these veggies (i.e. tomatoes, bell peppers, eggplants and white potatoes) have been the source of mixed reviews over the years, especially by social media influencers. Are they really the inflammatory monsters you need to be avoiding?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Let’s cut to the chase. Nightshades are not the problem—unless you have an intolerance to them. As Rissetto rightfully asks, “What did the tomato ever do to you?” There’s plenty of research that connects these specific vegetables to anti-inflammatory properties, especially due to their phytochemicals and other essential nutrients.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We have consistently given nightshades the seal of approval, and recipes like a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8052446/best-tomato-sandwich/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;summery tomato sandwich&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/breakfast-stuffed-peppers-8654722" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Breakfast Stuffed Peppers&lt;/a&gt; make them all the more enjoyable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-eating-too-much-protein"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Eating Too Much Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s clear that protein has had a major spotlight through trending recipes, viral fast food favorites and celebrity products. But what if we told you that you’re likely already eating enough protein in your day-to-day life?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “You don’t need to eat your bodyweight [in protein],” Rissetto clarifies. Use our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290496/this-is-how-much-protein-you-need-to-eat-every-day/#toc-how-much-protein-do-you-need-each-day" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein calculator&lt;/a&gt; to determine exactly how much protein you need, and you will see that it's only a fraction of your weight. Your body is only able to absorb so much protein, so &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291875/6-signs-you-could-be-eating-too-much-protein/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;eating too much&lt;/a&gt; may not lead to more benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein will keep you satisfied and can help with strength and mobility, but it isn’t the only nutrient you should focus on.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When you go to a 45-minute spin class, you don’t need to replenish anything,” Rissetto explains. “Just drink water.” Of course for special circumstances like running a marathon, having electrolytes is important. In general, water is hydrating enough for your typical day. And many electrolyte drinks on the market have a lot of added sugar, so they’re not ideal for a go-to beverage.

At &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;, we hold the firm philosophy that a balanced, non-restrictive diet is best, and paying attention to both your body’s wants and needs is key. If you’re unsure of what diet or exercise plan makes sense for you, talk to a healthcare professional or dietitian for personalized advice.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb0q500173b77dintz8b9@published"&gt;I’m a black woman of color in my late 20s, have been single for about six years, am pansexual, and would like to spend the next year or two in my slut era. I’ve wanted to have this era for the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="154" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb0se00183b77cskdcev8@published"&gt;I’d like to say that COVID is the main reason why I haven’t had it, but if I’m being honest, it’s because I don’t know where to start. My penetrative sexual experience is pretty limited—I’ve done it twice with two different partners and mostly felt awkward in both encounters—and have very little experience with women/nonbinary people, but would love to explore that. I’m not quite demisexual but need to get coffee or something before I can contemplate sex, and I am not one for one-night stands. I’d rather get coffee than drinks, as I’m not really a nightlife person. I’m awake around 5:30 a.m. without an alarm, so I’d rather be asleep by 9:30 p.m. than up until 2 a.m. at the club. I also have some sensory sensitivities (I’m level 1 autistic) related to bodily fluids (primarily sweat) that don’t bother me unless I’m stuck in my head, which I’m very prone to.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb0tz00193b77luqhq2x8@published"&gt;On top of this, my body has changed over the last few years in ways that I’m not the most comfortable with. I’ve primarily experienced weight loss, but I’ve always had some level of body dysmorphia, and it comes with a lot of stretch marks. I do groom regularly, but I’m still a bit hairy down there and don’t want to make partners floss, so to speak. At the same time, though, I know I’m attractive to others. So, how do I kick things off and find my (ideally several) people? And how do I get out of my head enough in the moment to actually enjoy it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb0z2001c3b77kd2bv6cf@published"&gt;One useful place to start is considering why you want to have this period of multiple sexual connections, and what degree of emotional and intellectual intimacy you’re both hoping for and willing to engage in. Ask yourself what you’re hoping to get out of this stage of your life—yes, an increase in experience, but for what purpose? Do you want to make friends while you’re giving each other orgasms? Are you open to forming romantic relationships if the potential is there, and would you want to keep those relationships open, or would you want to segue into monogamy?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="215" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb11a001d3b77lzgqkb4r@published"&gt;Meanwhile, Gen Xers and even Millennials—the generations popularly associated with hook-up culture (and expansive access to porn on the internet as chronicled in Sophie Gilbert’s &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/05/porn-american-pop-culture-feminism/682114/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girl on Girl: How Pop Culture Turned a Generation of Women Against Themselves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)—usually do, and generally always have, preferred a smidge of getting to know each other before going past groping. Think, the taxi ride or walk home from a club, a coffee in a public space when connecting from an app, and even, during the pandemic, a tendency to engage in a video call before meeting up. People anonymously having sex in nightclub bathrooms or going directly to each other’s apartments without exchanging face pictures are, and historically have been, outliers in the grand scheme of sex-having Americans. So, if the demisexual identity fits you in other ways, please do use it, but know that there’s nothing atypical about wanting to know the person you’re about to have sex with to some degree. Another detail that is completely typical is pubic hair. Sure, you may run into someone who—despite much of porn being full of pubes—has strange ideas about hairlessness being the norm, and they may be a jerk about it. Most likely, though, anyone with experience will know how to gently brush any hair out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb12r001e3b77w6pxnren@published"&gt;As for getting out of your head and being in the present moment, mindfulness is your best move here. I know it isn’t simple, and you may be thinking it sounds boring (if that’s the case, keep trying different forms until you find one that is engaging). Some autistic adults report that traditional mindfulness practices don’t work as well for them as for neurotypical people, so &lt;a href="https://thinkingautismguide.com/2024/08/mindfulness.html"&gt;here’s a quick list of additional ideas&lt;/a&gt;. The point here is to build your capacity to focus your mind on where you are right now and what you’re feeling in the moment. Find something that works for you and practice it every single day. Eventually, you’ll see results.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb148001f3b77tlo4aalp@published"&gt;You’ve got a couple of likely options when it comes to navigating your relationship with your body. You can highlight the parts you’d like to have appreciated, and combine that with engaging your mindfulness skills when someone comments on a part you’d rather ignore. You can also go for the “fake it till you make it” approach and highlight the aspects of your body that people comment positively on most. Know that—while much like with pubic hair, you may occasionally encounter a judgmental jerk—most of the time people are focused on appreciating the person in front of them, and far less likely to notice, much less be turned off by or comment negatively about, the areas you zero in on critically when you look in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqqb15w001g3b77r7vy15zy@published"&gt;To meet folks, ideally, you’d start putting yourself out there in community events that take place during the hours you prefer to be socially active. Apps are always an option (depending on where you live, you’ll have several available to you, and you’ll need to decide which of the bountiful array you’re most interested in trying). You might also consider asking friends whether they know anyone you might match nicely with.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two fresh Colorado Springs measles cases come amid multiple confirmed cases across Colorado, including in Aurora and Denver – many of which were linked to a Turkish Airlines flight that landed into DIA in mid-May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14600461/Where-worlds-infectious-disease-spreading-US-24-states-report-cases.html"&gt;Colorado officials are warning anyone&lt;/a&gt; who fears they may have been exposed to contact their health provider and monitor for symptoms in what is the latest in a string of measles scares to rock America's major airports and surrounding neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently there have been 1,168 confirmed measles cases in the US and at least three deaths reported by 34 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is the world's most contagious disease but those who are fully vaccinated are protected in 97 percent of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The current jurisdictions impacted are &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alaska/index.html" id="mol-84dd1750-4608-11f0-9b82-fd8c15ee512c"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/arkansas/index.html" id="mol-84dd3e60-4608-11f0-9b82-fd8c15ee512c"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-84dd8c80-4608-11f0-9b82-fd8c15ee512c"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/colorado/index.html" id="mol-84ddb390-4608-11f0-9b82-fd8c15ee512c"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/florida/index.html" id="mol-84dddaa0-4608-11f0-9b82-fd8c15ee512c"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, Georgia, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hawaii/index.html" id="mol-84de01b0-4608-11f0-9b82-fd8c15ee512c"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/illinois/index.html" id="mol-84de28c0-4608-11f0-9b82-fd8c15ee512c"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/indiana/index.html" id="mol-84de4fd0-4608-11f0-9b82-fd8c15ee512c"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these cases, three-quarters are in children under the age of 19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an updated advisory, the CDC is warning that people can get infected with measles during travel or at crowded events, unless they are fully &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7571481/Measles-warning-travelers-flew-Philadelphia-airport.html"&gt;vaccinated or have had the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The notice reads: 'Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings, including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The government agency recommends that all travelers be fully vaccinated against measles before traveling to an international destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Out of studied counties, 78 percent or 1,614 counties reported drops in MMR vaccination rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last time measles was this rife in the US was in 2019, when there &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6753425/How-completely-avoidable-measles-cases-continue-climb.html"&gt;were 1,274 cases reported for the entire year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to that, the biggest outbreak was in 1990, with numbers spiking to more than 27,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles was officially eradicated in the US in 2000 amid a successful vaccination campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-e13a1760-4099-11f0-83cb-973ee3fa2d45"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; described achieving measles elimination status in the US as a 'historic public health achievement'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a recent study found uptake of the vaccine among children declined in eight in 10 US counties last year, which is being &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6063419/Measles-outbreak-sweeping-CDC-reveals.html"&gt;signaled as the cause of the measles resurgence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, vaccine rates fell three percent across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It means that merely 91 percent of children are vaccinated against measles, which is well below the 95 percent need to prevent the disease from spreading and causing deaths.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Johns Hopkins University researchers warned that if vaccination rates continue to fall, measles is likely to completely return and become a common infection among Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A majority of those infected as well as the all of the deceased had not received their MMR vaccine - primarily due to vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, experts say. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet, ear infections and an intense fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of when to get vaccinated, experts say children need two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqoeyoi004n3b76j2r1sxah@published"&gt;One of the regulars, “Annie,” arrived with “Clay,” whom she met at the sex club we all frequent, and said he had brought a “big surprise.” That was an understatement. Clay was packing a nine-inch penis. Suffice it to say, all the women made sure he was properly “welcomed” into our social circle. Ever since then, I have been incredibly depressed. I can’t imagine how I’m ever going to satisfy my wife again. I’m not small, I would say I’m average, but how can I possibly compete with something like that?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqnwi1t001f3b76lfp5ux0u@published"&gt;Do you believe your wife when she tells you things? I ask because an alarming number of men don’t believe women when they express their preferences, especially when those preferences are at odds with men’s own ideals or ideas about what women want. The &lt;a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/dad-bod-body-image-trends-olly-murs-b1224933.html"&gt;recent controversy surrounding William Costello’s poll about Olly Murs’ shifting body&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2025/05/02/why-men-get-furious-at-women-who-say-they-prefer-the-dad-bod/"&gt;the many men who then accused female poll respondents of lying&lt;/a&gt;, are stark examples of the way that straight men can struggle with squaring their own expectations and the realities of women’s tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqnwi41001g3b76k4oxkuhu@published"&gt;If you don’t generally believe your wife, you’ve got a whole other, larger issue. But if you do, share your insecurities with her. Keep in mind that whole infants often pass through people’s vaginal canals, and after birth, those people are still able to enjoy penetrative sex. Remember that bigger—especially longer—often means battering of the cervix, which can make a large penis less attractive in the context of a committed relationship than in the context of a one-off at a sex party. And there’s so much more to sex than the in-and-out of it, at least as far as what women generally find enjoyable. With those facts in your mind as a baseline, listen to what your wife has to say in response to how you’re feeling. Internalize the reassurance she is likely to offer you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqnwi75001h3b760zyxgb59@published"&gt;It may also help to consider all of the things you bring to your marriage aside from your penis. You are, I’m certain, far more than a life support system for a fleshy, self-driving dildo. If you’re still struggling after taking all of these steps, therapy may be in order. Depression is serious, and if you’re experiencing enough symptoms of it to describe yourself as “incredibly depressed” in response to this one incident, it’s quite possible that there are more factors at play that a professional will be well-positioned to help you address.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbqnxhdy001q3b76mbtpcafq@published"&gt;My girlfriend “Anabel” has been having a problem for a couple of months now. Sometimes when we are having sex, it will feel like she’s about to orgasm and then her pussy will suddenly squeeze my dick so hard it’s painful. I lose my erection and have to wait in near-agony until she unclenches to get out. This has only happened a handful of times, but it’s VERY unpleasant when it does. Anabel is not at all happy about this, but says she doesn’t know how to distinguish between whether she is going to come or clamp up. It’s beginning to affect our love life because, as you can imagine, I am more than a little reluctant to take the risk. What can be done about this?&lt;/p&gt;

Absolutely do not, under any circumstances, encourage Anabel to search up various exercises and try them without professional guidance. It can do more harm than good. Keep in mind that the choice to see a medical professional is Anabel’s at the end of the day, but if she’s open to the idea, you can help by searching for local providers.&lt;/p&gt;

I have had an erratic work schedule for the past five months, and because of this, he claims he has to resort to self-pleasure since I’m never around when he wants sex. There have been plenty of times when I’ve tried to initiate, but he turns me down because (surprise!) it’s been less than an hour since he smacked it. At this point, I’m beginning to wonder if he even truly needs me at all—I can count the number of times we’ve had sex in the last couple of months on one hand without using all my fingers. Should I try and repair the connection that we used to have, or is he sending me a not-so-subtle message that our time together is over?&lt;/p&gt;

Who, unless you’ve left something out, considers sex off the table unless his penis is immediately ready to rise to the occasion? How do you feel about a relationship where your sense of security is based on his desire for sex with you? Where your connection is limited to physical engagement? Think through these questions, and I suspect you’ll have an answer to your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings, part of the German National Cohort (NAKO) population study, imply that programs to encourage physical activity and prevent infections in childhood may help lower the risk of developing MS later in life, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aerzteblatt.de/archiv/multiple-sklerose-familienvorgeschichte-lebensstil-und-gesundheitliche-faktoren-im-kindes-und-jugendalter-c8a5d38e-ed72-40fa-8b38-2bd2a23944a8"&gt;The relation of multiple sclerosis to family history, lifestyle, and health factors in childhood and adolescence: Findings of a case–control study nested within the German National Cohort (NAKO) Study,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” was published in &lt;em&gt;Deutsches Arzteblatt&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The causes of MS are still mostly unknown,” study co-author Heiko Becher, PhD, an epidemiologist and biostatistician at Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany, said in a &lt;a href="https://nako.de/en/press-releases/ms-research-focusses-on-the-early-years-of-life/"&gt;NAKO news story&lt;/a&gt;. “Some studies suggest that environmental and lifestyle factors can induce the development of disease in genetically predisposed people. Known risk factors include a genetic predisposition, an infection with the Epstein-Barr virus, a vitamin D deficiency, smoking and obesity. Influences from childhood and adolescence have so far been less well studied.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS is an inflammatory disorder that typically develops during adulthood, but an emerging body of research suggests that certain exposures during childhood may be &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt; for the disease. For example, childhood infection with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/epstein-barr-virus-and-ms/"&gt;Epstein-Barr virus&lt;/a&gt; (EBV) is a well-established MS risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Comparing childhood exposures to predict MS risk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared childhood exposures in a group of 576 people with MS and 895 people without MS who were matched by sex and age. Using statistical models, the researchers looked for childhood factors that were significantly more common in the MS patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results identified several well-established risk factors, such as EBV infection and obesity, but some other notable factors turned up as well. Data indicated that childhood infections increased the risk for MS by 14% per event, and stressful life events increased the risk by 25% per event. People born to a mother aged 30 or older were more than twice as likely to develop MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, more physical activity during childhood and adolescence was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the risk of MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings could have implications for clinical care, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results underline the relevance of existing preventive measures in the context of other non-communicable diseases – for example to prevent childhood infectious diseases, to encourage healthy eating habits or to motivate people to be active,” said Anja Holz, study co-author and a research fellow at University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf. “These could also be promising strategies in MS prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is a “particularly impressive example” of such a strategy, Holz said. “Current studies show that exercise in adulthood can act as a protective factor against MS. Targeted physical activity programs in adolescence might also potentially help to lower the risk of MS.”&lt;/p&gt;

                A vaccine pharmacist prepares samples as part of an HIV vaccine trial on March 16, 2022 in Masaka, Uganda. The vaccine in that trial did not prove effective. A promising vaccine development program funded by the National Institutes of Health was just informed by the Trump administration that its support will end next year.

   &lt;p&gt;For nearly 15 years, Dennis Burton worked on a project aimed at solving what he calls "one of the most difficult problems in biomedicine" — creating an HIV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That work was funded by the largest National Institutes of Health-funded program devoted to such research, with a seven-year grant totaling $258 million, and is considered one of the leading vaccine efforts. On May 30, he learned that work will end. In a video call, NIH officials told him that the Trump administration was terminating the program next year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's just devastating. So much human toil has gone into this," says the Scripps Research Institute immunologist. "Just when it looked like we could beat this virus, we're going to give up."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Designing an effective HIV vaccine has proven &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/04/26/179231916/failure-of-latest-hiv-vaccine-test-a-huge-disappointment" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;immensely challenging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for researchers, who've spent decades working to figure out how to prompt the immune system to protect against this wily virus, says &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/burton/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Burton&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the reasons it's so difficult is because the HIV virus evolves faster than any other known virus. Even within an infected individual, the virus can splinter off into many new variants, effectively dodging the immune system's first-responders — antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Burton and his colleagues at the &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/chavi-id" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a consortia of researchers at Scripps and Duke University known as CHAVD — have been working on a promising approach aimed at coaxing the immune system to make "broadly neutralizing antibodies" capable of attacking many forms of the virus. Clinical trials were slated to start as soon as next year. Without funding, they won't proceed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts that dilute taxpayer resources," a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson told NPR in response to a question about the rationale behind the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The news of the termination comes as the HIV vaccine has largely coalesced around the idea that broadly neutralizing antibodies are central to an effective HIV vaccine, says &lt;a href="https://www.iavi.org/person/mark-feinberg/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mark Feinberg&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, president and CEO of IAVI, a non-profit that develops vaccines. Scripps and Duke researchers were pursuing different approaches toward that shared goal, which is good, he says. "You don't know which is going to work and whether there's potential synergies between the two approaches."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration's termination of CHAVD is just the latest in a string of cuts and cancellations of HIV-vaccine related grants, from clinical trials to basic laboratory research. In 2022, the U.S. accounted for &lt;a href="https://avac.org/resource/infographic/top-vaccines-funders/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nearly 90%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the $731 million devoted to HIV vaccine research globally. If those funds dry up, many researchers fear that the prospects of getting an effective HIV vaccine will dwindle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"After many years of frustration and negative results we now believe that there is a pathway to develop an efficacious HIV vaccine," says Feinberg. "It's really disappointing at this time to have the foundation kicked out from underneath you."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A canceled African trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The NIH-funded project isn't the only vaccine research being affected by the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In late January, biomedical scientist &lt;a href="https://idm.uct.ac.za/contacts/linda-gail-bekker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Linda-Gail Bekker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and her colleagues were gathered in Tanzania to discuss their efforts to develop and test HIV vaccines across eight African countries. That team, called &lt;a href="https://africanalliance.org.za/brilliant-consortium-shut-down-home-page/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The BRILLIANT HIV vaccine consortium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had won a five-year $45 million dollar grant from USAID in 2023 and was days away from starting its first clinical trial in humans when it got a stop-work order from the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"To say we were disappointed is to completely underplay how we felt," said Bekker, of the University of Cape Town. "We felt desperate, that something we'd been working so hard to accomplish was removed without a good reason."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bekker and her colleagues had spent a year assembling a team of research biologists and clinicians from around the world to develop immunogens — substances that kick start an immune response that serve as the basis for future vaccines. They looked for inspiration, in part, from HIV patients in South Africa whose bodies seem to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/12/12/786811843/a-new-hiv-vaccine-effort-with-a-different-kind-of-strategy" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;naturally produce&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; broadly neutralizing antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The idea was to base [vaccines] on [HIV] viruses that had been discovered in Africa and immunogens designed based on those viruses as templates," she said. Underscoring the global nature of HIV vaccine research, scientists with the CHAVD program helped design some of the immunogens, Bekker says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Then, the team would "put these immunogens into humans, in clinical trials, to test whether we can actually move the human immune system to make broadly neutralizing antibodies," says Bekker. Those clinical trials were slated to happen in African countries where the HIV epidemic is most severe, allowing researchers to more clearly assess whether the vaccines work than if they were to test them in, say, the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, Bekker and her colleagues have largely stopped vaccine-related work and are instead scrambling to find alternative funds for the project.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The USAID grant is "irreplaceable" in terms of its scope, says Bekker. The team is now figuring out how to scale back their ambitions by running fewer, smaller clinical trials. But that means the data will be less valuable, says Bekker.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These kinds of international collaborations are commonplace in efforts to develop and test HIV vaccines, researchers told NPR — and face an uncertain future under the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In May, NIH announced it would &lt;a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-25-104.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;no longer fund&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; foreign "subawards," which allow U.S. scientists to pay foreign collaborators to conduct research overseas. Last year, NIH funded more than 3,600 such awards. Instead, foreign researchers must apply directly to NIH for funding, a barrier that will likely reduce foreign collaboration, says &lt;a href="https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/zolla-paznerlab/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Susan Zolla-Pazner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiologist at the Ichan School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Foreign partners in HIV research are extremely important," she says. "It's a global disease and viruses don't recognize national boundaries." For example, if a researcher wanted to study how to prevent babies from being infected by their HIV-positive mothers, the best thing to do is conduct the study in a place where such mothers exist in sufficient numbers, which is outside of the U.S. says Zolla-Pazner. If you can't do that, "it's more than a hurdle. It's a brick wall in terms of being able to understand how to protect a population of women and their children."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;On top of these restrictions, researchers worry generally about the prospect of getting vaccine-related grants accepted in the current climate. NIH has already cancelled or delayed payments on over 2,500 individual grants, including some related to HIV vaccine research, and under the Trump administration has&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/28/nx-s1-5414642/trump-vaccine-bird-flu-mrna" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; signaled a shift away&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from mRNA vaccine research — the same platform that allowed rapid development of the first COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pessimism — and yet hope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Altogether, the administration's actions — and &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2026-budget-in-brief.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;pledges to cut funding&lt;/a&gt; for NIH grants by more than 40% next year — have many researchers pessimistic about the prospects of developing an HIV vaccine anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"My personal view is that advances will stall out," says Burton, the Scripps scientist. "The United States led the world in HIV vaccine research, I don't think that anyone's going to step into the breach," he says. "Philanthropy can certainly help, but they're unlikely to step in with the magnitude of funding needed."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even if funding eventually comes back, from the U.S. or elsewhere, it can be difficult for research groups to bounce back from extended cuts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It is putting a period in the middle of a sentence," says Zolla-Pazner. "You cannot reconstitute that group, even two months later, because people have lost their jobs."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other researchers are hopeful the field will eventually build on the progress already made to deliver an HIV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It remains a huge challenge, but we now have little chinks of light of how to move this field forward," says Bekker. "I believe we will get back on track, but we will have lost time," she says. "And that means people's lives."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have information you want to share about the ongoing changes at federal science agencies and their effects on research?

Current tests for Alzheimer’s involve brain scans known as PET scans and spinal taps to measure proteins indicating brain changes. While accurate, these tests can be invasive, uncomfortable, and costly. Scientists now offer a promising alternative—a simple blood test that reliably identifies Alzheimer's with accuracy comparable to more invasive methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Mayo Clinic recently demonstrated the effectiveness of blood tests to diagnose Alzheimer’s in a clinical outpatient setting. The team published their findings in &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer's and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting a 95% sensitivity rate—meaning it accurately detected Alzheimer's 95% of the time—and an 82% specificity rate, effectively ruling out the disease in those without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="blood_tests_a_practical_alternative"&gt;Blood Tests: A Practical Alternative&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease, characterized by progressive memory loss, behavioral changes, and cognitive decline, deeply affects patients and their families. Its early detection can significantly improve patient care and expand treatment options. Standard diagnostic tests, such as PET imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, accurately detect Alzheimer's but come with high costs and patient discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Gregg Day, M.D., a Mayo Clinic neurologist, dementia specialist and clinical researcher.

These patients experienced a wide variety of cognitive impairments, including typical memory-related symptoms of Alzheimer's, Lewy body dementia, vascular impairment, and other atypical &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/study-reveals-air-pollution-plays-a-major-role-in-cognitive-decline/"&gt;cognitive disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients in the study were aged between 32 and 89, with symptoms beginning around age 66 on average. Over half were ultimately diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. This diverse patient group mirrors typical clinic populations, validating the broad clinical use of blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers focused on measuring two critical blood proteins—Aβ42/40 and p-tau217—which indicate the buildup of amyloid plaques, a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-new-discovery-predicts-early-onset-of-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;hallmark of Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;. Results confirmed significantly higher levels of p-tau217 in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, demonstrating clear differentiation from other cognitive conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="biomarkers_influenced_by_kidney_function"&gt;Biomarkers Influenced by Kidney Function&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study found plasma p-tau217 concentrations were affected by kidney function. Elevated biomarker levels correlated with impaired kidney function, a critical insight that clinicians must consider to interpret results correctly. This finding underscores the complexity of blood-based diagnostics and the importance of holistic patient evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Distribution of plasma AD biomarkers by diagnosis and CSF p-tau181/Aβ42.

Specifically, 233 out of 246 patients with Alzheimer’s-related cognitive impairment (95%) had positive biomarker profiles, reinforcing the accuracy of blood-based diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="expanding_utility_and_access"&gt;Expanding Utility and Access&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood tests hold tremendous promise beyond diagnostic clarity. Researchers emphasize their potential for selecting suitable participants for clinical trials and assessing patient response to new treatments. With recent approvals of treatments like lecanemab and donanemab targeting &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-an-exciting-new-way-to-treat-alzheimers-and-other-neurodegenerative-diseases/"&gt;early-stage Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, accessible and affordable diagnostics have become even more critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mayo Clinic study aligns with prior research demonstrating blood test effectiveness compared to traditional amyloid PET scans. Dr. Day's team plans to extend research to broader and more diverse populations, including those who are asymptomatic but at risk for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Correlation between plasma and CSF AD biomarker concentrations.

They also tended to spend more time viewing these images compared to positive ones. The longer viewing times suggest that they were paying more attention to threatening and neutral content. The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.02.039"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression, or major depressive disorder, is a mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, emptiness, or irritability, often accompanied by a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities. It affects people of all ages and backgrounds and is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms may also include fatigue, changes in appetite or weight, sleep disturbances, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. In more severe cases, depression can lead to thoughts of death or suicide. It may be triggered by stressful life events, trauma, medical conditions, or occur without an obvious cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression also appears to influence how people process information. Individuals with depression tend to focus more on negative or sad content while paying less attention to neutral or positive information. This phenomenon, known as attentional bias, can reinforce negative thought patterns and contribute to the persistence and severity of depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Xiaobo Liu and his colleagues aimed to investigate whether individuals with depression display an attentional bias toward threatening images. They hypothesized that depressed participants would pay more attention to threatening pictures compared to healthy individuals. To test this, they conducted an eye-tracking experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 100 individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder and 100 healthy control participants. The healthy participants were matched to the depressed group by age, education, and gender. The average age in both groups was between 27 and 28 years. Women made up 76% of the depressed group and 73% of the control group. On average, the depressed participants had been experiencing symptoms for about one year, though there was considerable individual variation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants completed assessments for depression and anxiety using the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. They also participated in an eye-tracking task that involved viewing a series of images from the International Affective Picture System, categorized as threatening, positive, or neutral. Participants were instructed to view the images as if they were watching television, while an eye-tracking device recorded their gaze patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Threatening images typically depicted scenes of danger, violence, or injury—such as aggressive animals, weapons, or accidents—and were intended to provoke fear or anxiety. Positive images included content like smiling faces, nature scenes, or playful animals. Neutral images showed everyday objects or people with neutral expressions and were designed to evoke little emotional response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed that individuals with depression spent significantly more time looking at threatening and neutral images compared to healthy participants. They also made fewer saccades—rapid eye movements between fixations—suggesting less visual exploration of these images. Additionally, compared to how they viewed positive images, depressed participants spent more time fixating on threatening and neutral images and showed reduced eye movement. These findings indicate an increased attentional focus on emotionally negative or ambiguous content. Healthy participants did not show similar patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients with MDD [major depressive disorder] exhibit abnormal attentional bias toward threatening stimuli, which is associated with the severity of retardation symptoms in MDD,” the authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study offers insights into how individuals with depression process emotionally charged visual information. However, the researchers caution that eye movements are not a perfect measure of attention. While eye-tracking devices can record where someone is looking and how long they maintain their gaze, it does not definitively confirm whether they are mentally engaged with that content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.02.039"&gt;Attentional bias toward threatening stimuli in major depressive disorder: A free-viewing eye-tracking study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Xiaobo Liu, Yuxi Li, Yuan Chen, Chen Xue, Jin Fan, Jiaming Zhang, Dongling Zhong, Qinjian Dong, Zhong Zheng, Juan Li, and Rongjiang Jin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 14:03:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPWmpZZFlQenFha0Nvd3k3Mk9mSkE5ZUZTNndhMlRsRHBkV2p4T0dzR0IxX2l6Z2R0cDlFdFhLYzltY3poTGkyeGc2Tm1TaUUyVUNqVzV5RUpjZGxOZ2NFUWlMS2FnczBMRmMxeW5jX2taWkNTaWlMY3ljb2NmTXZfS01IY2swd1JFYWFrSmhRVE8ycE4tUFJzbmhseGZwZw</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，维生素C含量高于橙子的排名第一的蔬菜- EatingWell | The #1 Underrated Vegetable with More Vitamin C Than an Orange, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNSDMwbTdISEE4a2FZXzRncWtfUFFxN0tFNEJQc2ItbjR6NG1tRWo1R1pqbHA0Unl6Z1NKUWxfZTlpZHZHODVOdjVMMGdLNXVNY1dYc0lkOXppVlQ1QXg5Z2VfRlk2SHRDSi1fcGRxMTQ1ZXR4ZURVWnIyMWtOTHBFNjFXdmdQZHA5TzdBX1hkalNsTnFpUGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

While you can consume collagen through &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7905460/the-best-collagen-powders-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt;, your body makes collagen on its own and requires vitamin C to do so.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is one of the reasons why vitamin C is often linked to hair, skin and nail health. “A deficiency of this vitamin can often be identified in your skin and in the unhealthy gums in your mouth,” says Salge Blake.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin C is best-known for its role in supporting a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-things-to-do-for-better-immune-health-8584490" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy immune system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Vitamin C helps our immune system fight off illness through its action as a potent antioxidant. This helps protect cells from damage,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drewhemler/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Drew Hemler, M.Sc., RD, CDN, FAND&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to its antioxidant effects, vitamin C is required for various functions within immune cells, and its role in skin health provides an important barrier against harmful pathogens.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Still, it’s important to note that research is ongoing to understand the benefits of vitamin C intake—especially above the recommended DV—and protection against infection and other diseases.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As we age, our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-for-eye-health-according-to-a-dietitian-8773671" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eye health&lt;/a&gt; can decline thanks in part to oxidative stress. Vitamins A, C and E have all been linked with helping to prevent or delay the onset of cataracts and age-related macular degeneration, thanks to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Before you reach for a bottle of vitamin C, it’s worth noting that one review suggests that, when paired with an overall healthy diet, consuming vitamin C rich foods may be more beneficial than supplements for slowing the progression of age related cataracts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With the majority of the immune system housed in the gut, it may not come as a surprise that there’s ongoing research on the impact of vitamin C on gut health. Small studies suggest that vitamin C may help promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria and strengthen the gut lining by increasing the production of short-chain fatty acids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Still, while promising, larger studies are needed to better understand the impact of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-c-and-gut-health-8558337" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C on gut health&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s more to this tree-shaped green veggie than just vitamin C. “Broccoli doesn’t just come with vitamin C, it also provides a slew of nutrients that help your body absorb and use it more effectively. You’re not just getting a dose of vitamin C, you’re getting a whole system of support,” says Hemler. Here are some of these benefits: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a Good Source of Dietary Fiber: &lt;/strong&gt;One ½-cup serving of cooked broccoli provides 3 grams of filling fiber.1 &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; not only keeps you fuller for longer, but is also important for gut, heart and metabolic health. Most Americans are falling short of meeting the recommended 25–38 grams of fiber per day, making broccoli a helpful food for closing the gap in your daily fiber intake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It Provides a Boost of Potassium: &lt;/strong&gt;According to Salge Blake, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290730/signs-youre-not-getting-enough-potassium-and-what-to-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt; is another nutrient of concern that most Americans aren’t getting enough of.8 Potassium is crucial for fluid balance within cells and plays an important role in heart health and blood pressure management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One ½-cup serving of cooked broccoli provides 229 mg of potassium, or about 5% of the DV.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s an Excellent Source of Folate and Vitamin K:&lt;/strong&gt; One ½-cup serving of cooked broccoli boasts an impressive 21% of the DV for folate and 91% of the DV for vitamin K. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7937128/foods-with-more-folate-than-kale/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Folate&lt;/a&gt; is essential for healthy cell function and particularly important for people who are or may become pregnant. &lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Meanwhile &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7914418/what-is-vitamin-k/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;vitamin K&lt;/a&gt; is known for its role in blood clotting and may also support bone health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It Supports Iron Absorption: &lt;/strong&gt;Another benefit of vitamin C is that it helps with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-to-take-iron-supplement-8637263" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;iron absorption&lt;/a&gt;, particularly from plant-based sources. Thanks to its vitamin C content, pairing broccoli with a plant-based source of iron, like beans or soy, may help support healthy iron levels in the blood.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Broccoli is a versatile and (generally) inexpensive vegetable that can be found in almost every grocery store—either in the produce section and/or the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290575/fresh-vs-frozen-vegetables-are-we-giving-up-nutrition-for-convenience/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;frozen food&lt;/a&gt; aisle. Here are some easy ways to prepare it: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roast or Grill It: &lt;/strong&gt;For an easy side, toss broccoli with oil and seasonings and roast it in the oven or throw it &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/277835/grilled-broccoli-with-smoky-yogurt-sauce/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;on the grill&lt;/a&gt;. Salge Blake says the latter is her favorite method, noting that grilled broccoli works beautifully as an addition to grain bowls, salads and pasta dishes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steam It:&lt;/strong&gt; Simple yet classic, steaming broccoli is a quick and nutritious pairing for a heartier protein, like salmon, chicken breast or a veggie burger. Pro tip: don’t skimp on the seasonings! A light squeeze of lemon, dash of dried herbs and grate of fresh garlic can go a long way. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rice It: &lt;/strong&gt;While you may have heard of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cauliflower-rice-recipe-8401635" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cauliflower rice&lt;/a&gt;, riced broccoli is a lesser-known option that’s become a staple in my family’s meals. Try adding it to a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/broccoli-casserole-recipes-to-make-forever-8404203" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;casserole&lt;/a&gt;, quiche or rice bowl for an easy nutrient boost. While relatively easy to rice yourself using a food processor, you can also look for riced broccoli in the frozen foods section at your local supermarket for added convenience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chop or Shred It: &lt;/strong&gt;Helmer’s favorite way to enjoy broccoli is raw, chopped or shredded, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8017785/creamy-broccoli-slaw/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;slaw&lt;/a&gt; with a tangy vinegar-based dressing. “It makes a super crunchy, fresh summer side dish,” he says. Shredded broccoli also works well in salads, tacos, sandwiches and wraps for an easy lunch or dinner. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puree It:&lt;/strong&gt; From broccoli cheese soup (perfect for soup weather days) to dips and sauces, purred broccoli is another easy way to add a boost of veggies that even picky eaters will enjoy. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Broccoli is one of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-c-vegetables-8768521" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the best veggies&lt;/a&gt; for boosting your vitamin C intake. Vitamin C is an essential nutrient with numerous functions, including supporting a strong immune system. Besides providing more than 50% of your daily vitamin C needs, broccoli is packed with other essential nutrients, including fiber, potassium, folate, vitamin K and antioxidants. “Essentially, broccoli is like the Swiss Army knife of veggies—small, but loaded with tools your body loves!” says Hemler.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another benefit? Broccoli is incredibly versatile and can be found in virtually any grocery store—including the frozen section of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/6-best-anti-inflammatory-foods-at-dollar-tree-8777894" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;some dollar stores&lt;/a&gt;.

Scientists activated neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, known for their role in stress response, which caused sleep loss and poor memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, inhibiting these neurons in stressed mice reduced memory issues and slightly improved sleep quality. The pathway between the PVN and lateral hypothalamus appears central to stress-related cognitive and sleep disruptions, offering a target for future interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PVN Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; Stimulating stress-related PVN neurons caused sleep loss and memory problems in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Pathway Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; The PVN-lateral hypothalamus connection mediates stress effects on cognition and sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Target:&lt;/strong&gt; Inhibiting the pathway improved memory and sleep in stressed male mice, suggesting a possible therapeutic route.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress worsens sleep quality and can impair memory. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shinjae Chung, from the University of Pennsylvania, led a study to explore a neural pathway in male mice that stress may influence to cause sleep and memory disturbances.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110784"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stress-sleep-memory-neurosicen.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stress-sleep-memory-neurosicen-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stress-sleep-memory-neurosicen-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stress-sleep-memory-neurosicen-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stress-sleep-memory-neurosicen-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stress-sleep-memory-neurosicen-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stress-sleep-memory-neurosicen-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stress-sleep-memory-neurosicen.jpg" alt="This shows a woman sleeping." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stress-sleep-memory-neurosicen.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stress-sleep-memory-neurosicen-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stress-sleep-memory-neurosicen-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stress-sleep-memory-neurosicen-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stress-sleep-memory-neurosicen-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stress-sleep-memory-neurosicen-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/stress-sleep-memory-neurosicen-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;According to the researchers, this neural pathway may inform future work exploring ways to improve sleep and cognitive deficits associated with stress-related disorders, at least in males.

This experimental manipulation made mice sleep less and impaired how well mice performed in a memory task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, when mice were stressed, artificially inhibiting these PVN neurons reduced stress-related memory issues while slightly improving sleep.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further probing what neural pathway may be involved, Chung and colleagues discovered that stress and artificial activation of the PVN neurons separately targeted another brain region called the lateral hypothalamus (LH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bridging their findings together, the researchers found that this neural pathway from the PVN to the LH may be involved in stress-related memory impairment and sleep disruptions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, this neural pathway may inform future work exploring ways to improve sleep and cognitive deficits associated with stress-related disorders, at least in males. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep, memory, and stress research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#751810111c143506131b5b1a0712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfn.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN Media – SfN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2146-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Role of Hypothalamic CRH Neurons in Regulating the Impact of Stress on Memory and Sleep&lt;/a&gt;” by Shinjae Chung et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role of Hypothalamic CRH Neurons in Regulating the Impact of Stress on Memory and Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress profoundly affects sleep and memory processes. Stress impairs memory consolidation, and similarly, disruptions in sleep compromise memory functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, the neural circuits underlying stress-induced sleep and memory disturbances are still not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we show that activation of corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (CRH&lt;sup&gt;PVN&lt;/sup&gt;), similar to acute restraint stress, decreases sleep and impairs memory in a spatial object recognition task in male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, inhibiting CRH&lt;sup&gt;PVN&lt;/sup&gt; neurons during stress reduces stress-induced memory deficits while slightly increasing the amount of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that both stress and stimulation of CRH&lt;sup&gt;PVN&lt;/sup&gt; neurons activate neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), and that CRH&lt;sup&gt;PVN&lt;/sup&gt; projections to the LH regulate stress-induced memory deficits and sleep disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that CRH&lt;sup&gt;PVN&lt;/sup&gt; neuronal pathways regulate the adverse effects of stress on memory and sleep – an important step toward improving sleep and ameliorating cognitive deficits associated with stress-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 13:58:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTFBvcEJSX1ZjTGZHUko3dFRXalZFQ0JXNTRHQ2JhTXFiX0oxZmxzcHpwaUduVG9JWnBIMy1VX0RtbWM3ODJ2MV8zTjJiT1V6LVJKVXJqUjhTOURaLUt4OVNWU0hfSXY0UQ</guid></item><item><title>这就是为什么如果您是癌症幸存者，锻炼如此重要的原因-《华盛顿邮报》 | Here’s why exercise is so important if you’re a cancer survivor - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOTlMyRDRKNWJkRG9ZOHNkazFNSTZ6LVBjS3VNVS1WWGs0OEZPUHdyYm9Xc0QxeVotd0hlOXBnbUV0WElQQXdKb0U0OEdhTlJpczFlVnUxUjJsaWItemtBcDV1MVBPZU8yNGNoUjRDMG1ucmxyVENFYjg3NFppRmgxWmVR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VP3VQLGLIFGYZBMZY75ZHWQQTE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You may have heard that moderate intensity exercise — even brisk walking — may be linked to a&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502760" target="_blank"&gt; 37 percent reduction in risk of death&lt;/a&gt; over time for colon cancer survivors, according to a surprising new study.

People with Stage 2 or Stage 3 colon cancer (who had already completed surgery and chemotherapy two to six months earlier, and also passed a treadmill test) were given a structured exercise program that pushed them to reach certain exertion targets, almost as if they were in physical therapy. That made a difference, noted &lt;a href="https://radonc.utoronto.ca/faculty/rebecca-wong" target="_blank"&gt;Rebecca Wong&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the radiation oncology department at the University of Toronto and a co-author of the study, because it provided motivation and goals that enabled people to stick with exercise over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YHS7N3DOPNGL7DMFP3MP3EHDJM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In all, 445 people were put on the structured exercise program for three years and another 444 patients were simply advised that exercise would help their prognosis. In the structured program, people hit their targets mainly by brisk walking, which is considered moderate intensity activity, though some were able to do higher-intensity activities such as jogging, swimming, biking, playing pickleball or tennis. But the benefit isn’t just from having a structured regimen, Wong said. It’s having one you stick with for the long haul. “It’s a lifestyle change,” Wong said. “It’s not so much, do this for three years and you can go back and sit on the couch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NSBREXYCJRFS7OHTSHEXDMSEZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And the reduced risk was not just for colon cancer. Patients in the structured exercise group also were less likely to develop new primary cancers, indicating there is potentially a protective effect for other cancers as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="4KJTPNIK3RHTFCY57YUJDEN5XI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="4KJTPNIK3RHTFCY57YUJDEN5XI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;How should cancer patients exercise?&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PUVGEZLYSVEHZHZZAVKWM5GIK4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For cancer survivors, the&lt;a href="https://www.exerciseismedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/EIM_Rx-for-Health_Cancer.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; American College of Sports Medicine recommends&lt;/a&gt; starting slowly and building up to at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity a week, either moderate-intensity activity such as walking, light cycling, yoga, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2024/how-to-start-tai-chi/" target="_blank"&gt;tai chi&lt;/a&gt; or water exercise, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous activity such as brisk walking, singles tennis or hiking hills — or a combination of both. They also recommend some strength and resistance exercises such as weight training two to three times per week, suggesting 6 to 15 reps using weights, resistance bands, weight machines or your own body, doing things such as kitchen counter &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/10/no-more-girl-push-ups/" target="_blank"&gt;push-ups&lt;/a&gt; or chair squats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7FMKRD5R7RBQ5NZBFDHO5YA6IY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Of course, if you have cancer or have recently completed treatment, the last thing you might want to hear is that you need to work out. Given how physically arduous cancer treatment can be, it’s important to note that the new study was conducted in patients who had completed active treatment for their colon cancer, said &lt;a href="https://medicine.med.ubc.ca/sharlene-gill/" target="_blank"&gt;Sharlene Gill&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of medicine at the University of British Columbia and a co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QJ5EYSBD6VDYJGUDX6CEFJKVRU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The findings “can’t be extrapolated to those patients who are on active treatment and are managing symptoms and side effects, but we believe there would be a quality of life benefit,” Gill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UUGY4HCLGVHQXGYKCYQGPKFGVQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For those people, exercise needs to be matched with capacity. The “general rule is that any activity is better than no activity, and it should be moderate but not intense,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PGC764A4FJF4ZAXSFQH7BM2FPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some say their fatigue is not too bad in the morning so they can try to exercise early in the day, while others say nausea is worse after they eat so they can try to exercise before they eat, Courneya said. If pain or nausea are too severe, they should rest. But he added that exercise has been shown to help with these symptoms, especially fatigue and pain, so if possible, patients could try to push through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IZD6CBWJCNG5HO62EDBANWQMWE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Patients will need to judge their own side effects and work around them,” Courneya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="25GMMQHPSNCTRL2HE5NAZD4WHI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We recommend that patients undergoing treatment do activity as they are able, but definitely acknowledging the challenges, especially around the time of treatments,” &lt;a href="https://hospital.uillinois.edu/find-a-doctor/deborah-manst" target="_blank"&gt;Deborah Manst&lt;/a&gt;, an oncogeneralist at the University of Illinois Cancer Center and a clinical assistant professor in family and community medicine, wrote in an email.

&lt;p&gt;While it’s still early to understand if these findings can apply to patients, exploring brain circuits beyond the basal ganglia — a region involved in motor control and affected by Parkinson’s — may lead to new treatments that ease the disease’s motor symptoms, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even if the path toward new therapeutic approaches to alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease still appears long, such foundational research is immensely important,” Wolfgang Kruse, PhD, a researcher at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany, said in a &lt;a href="https://news.rub.de/english/press-releases/2025-05-27-optogenetics-how-brain-stimulation-alleviates-symptoms-parkinsons-disease"&gt;university press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-96995-4"&gt;Optogenetic stimulation of inferior colliculus neurons elicits mesencephalic locomotor region activity and reverses haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; as a collaborative effort from researchers at Ruhr and Philipps-Universität Marburg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Sound processing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Parkinson’s, the loss of dopaminergic neurons — the nerve cells in the brain that produce the signaling molecule dopamine— stops input into the basal ganglia. As a result, patients experience a range of motor symptoms, from tremor and slowed movement to stiffness and problems with balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients with advanced disease, or those who no longer respond to medication, may benefit from &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-treatments/surgical-treatments/"&gt;deep brain stimulation&lt;/a&gt; (DBS), in which small electrodes are placed deep in the brain — usually in parts of the basal ganglia. These electrodes are connected by thin wires to a device that delivers electrical pulses to regulate brain circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inferior colliculus is a region of the brain that processes both sound and the emotional tone behind it. It also seems to play a role in how the body moves in response to sound. While it’s not a conventional target for DBS, stimulating this region was found to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19990-y"&gt;ease catalepsy&lt;/a&gt; (loss of voluntary movement) in rats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That finding raised the question of whether the inferior colliculus may send signals to the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), which is responsible for initiating and controlling voluntary movement. This region also receives input from the &lt;em&gt;substantia nigra&lt;/em&gt; of the basal ganglia, a key region affected in Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a technique called optogenetics, which allowed them to stimulate specific nerve cells in the inferior colliculus of rats using light. They then recorded the activity of nerve cells in the MLR using electrophysiology, which measures electrical signals in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are indications that stimulation of this region of the brain leads to activation of the mesencephalic locomotor region, or MLR,” said researcher Liana Melo-Thomas, PhD, who led the study in Marburg. “We suspected that this would have a positive effect on ambulatory ability.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recordings showed that nerve cells in the MLR became active upon stimulation of the inferior colliculus using light. The response in the MLR occurred with an average delay of 4.7 milliseconds, suggesting that these regions are connected and can communicate through synapses — tiny junctions between nerve cells that pass messages using chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Simultaneous measurements in the deeper MLR region showed increased activity in the majority of cells, although nearly one quarter of the cells were inhibited by the additional activity in the inferior colliculus,” Kruse said. This supports the idea that the inferior colliculus may affect movement by communicating with the MLR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then turned to a model of catalepsy induced by haloperidol, an antipsychotic that works by blocking dopaminergic signaling, to understand if using light to either activate or inhibit the inferior colliculus would affect how long the rats remained immobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After light stimulation, only the group with optogenetic activation of the inferior colliculus showed a noticeable improvement. These rats stepped down from a bar more quickly than they had before stimulation and faster than other groups of rats. This stimulation didn’t change their general activity levels or emotional response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The present study contributes to our understanding of the neural circuits involved in motor control and may have implications for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for motor-related disorders,” the researchers concluded, adding that further research is needed to understand the clinical relevance of their findings.&lt;/p&gt;
