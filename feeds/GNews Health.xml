The studies involved  more than 411,000 adults with an average age of 69.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2Z523ROHOFFQJF7YQN72SHMHLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The analysis revealed that technology could play a role in preserving brain function, not worsening it, said co-authors Jared Benge, a clinical neuropsychologist at the University of Texas at Austin’s Dell Medical School, and Michael Scullin, an associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MVJ62QKLWFH7NMSUILPSLABH4Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There was no credible evidence from the longitudinal studies, or the meta-analysis as a whole, for widespread digital ‘brain drain’ or ‘digital dementia’ as a result of general, natural uses of digital technology,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LAA4NZHP4BECNFMDLBPE5V3DSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Among the possible reasons, according to the study, is that the challenge of using and adapting to evolving digital technology might provide the cognitive stimulation that maintains brain function.

              &lt;p&gt;A 35-year-old man says he transformed his body in a few months by switching to full-body workouts and smaller portion sizes with a protein goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Simon Doyle, a GP from London, had a consistent fitness routine until a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/shoulder-hurt-when-lifting-arm-pain-overhead-press-when-stop-2022-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;shoulder injury&lt;/a&gt; left him out of the gym for more than a year, during which he started to feel out of shape and struggled to bounce back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It happens gradually. You don't notice until you think 'I don't look like myself,'" Doyle told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doyle wanted to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/strength-training-techniques-eccentric-concentric-build-muscle-2022-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;build strength and muscle&lt;/a&gt; while also burning body fat for a leaner, more defined physique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, he started working with &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://adamenazpt.com/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Adam Enaz&lt;/a&gt;, a personal trainer who specializes in helping men in their 30s and 40s &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/burn-fat-build-muscle-workouts-diet-personal-trainer-2024-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;build muscle and lose fat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enaz helped Doyle structure his workouts and diet over three months without adding more hours in the gym or strict food rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was replicating my usual routine but getting more out of it," Doyle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a few simple changes, he said, he was able to cut his &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/healthy-body-fat-percentage" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;body fat&lt;/a&gt; from an estimated 19% to 10% (measured via a smart scale).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="01d57cb1-4727-4863-92ea-3e0136087c7c" data-toc-id="01d57cb1-4727-4863-92ea-3e0136087c7c"&gt;Full-body workouts can save time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doyle said he already had a habit of hitting the gym for about an hour Monday through Friday before work, but his &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/workout-split-how-to-tone-body-build-muscle-faster-2021-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;workout split&lt;/a&gt; was wasting time on individual muscle groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, he started focusing on &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/avoid-mistakes-get-in-shape-for-summer-personal-trainer-tips-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;more efficient full-body workout&lt;/a&gt; sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doyle also incorporated a technique called &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-build-muscle-and-burn-fat-faster-with-supersets-2024-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;supersets&lt;/a&gt; — performing two exercises back-to-back without full rest, such as dips and chin-ups or chest presses and rows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's important for me to be able to get the workout done in 50 minutes," he said, given that he has limited time for the gym before his busy workday. "I'm using my rest time to work different muscle groups."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="6eb18315-0f92-4e1f-beb4-2715d18bf442" data-toc-id="6eb18315-0f92-4e1f-beb4-2715d18bf442"&gt;Increasing weight is key for muscle gains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doyle said tracking his workouts boosted his progress by adding more weight to his lifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His typical session involved three sets per exercise and no more than 12 reps per set. If he hit all 12 reps, he would increase the weight to make it more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technique of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/progressive-overload-fitness-meaning-and-how-to-do-it-2021-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;progressive overload&lt;/a&gt;, gradually putting more stress on your muscles, is a well-established fitness technique. That's what prompts muscles to build back bigger and stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, Doyle said he would get stuck at a certain weight. Recently, Enaz helped him break through a plateau by increasing the weight on the first set, even if he couldn't lift heavier for all three, until he was able to adapt, Doyle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You really track that to make sure you're not plateauing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At just 6 months old, KJ received a gene editing treatment custom-built to correct his unique mutation. He’s not cured, researchers explained at the annual American Society of Gene &amp;amp; Cell Therapy meeting in New Orleans. But he has been able to resume a normal diet and is no longer on the path to a liver transplant. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The news could not have come at a more welcome or more jarring time for the field. For three years, gene editing has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/06/crispr-gene-editing-medical-breakthrough-not-matched-by-financial-success/"&gt;seemed in free fall&lt;/a&gt;, riven by layoffs, closures, shuttered programs and sinking stock prices.  Now here, finally, in striped pajama form, was a reminder of what a decade of advances could deliver. “How awesome is it that we’re at this point?” said Nessan Bermingham, who co-founded and led Intellia, one of the first CRISPR companies, until 2017. &lt;/p&gt;

They know that vagus nerve activity, known as vagal tone, reduces heart rate, for instance, but they don't know which of the 200,000 fibers are behind that mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration approved a vagus nerve stimulation device, which is similar to a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/what-is-a-pacemaker" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;pacemaker&lt;/a&gt; and implanted into a patient's neck, to treat epilepsy in 1997 and depression in 2005. But it's also being studied as a therapy for several inflammatory conditions, including &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/work-remote-health-condition-return-to-office-policies-2024-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Tracey and his team at the Feinstein Institute became the first to discover this link. When they stimulated the vagus nerves of mice with a handheld stimulator, it reduced their inflammation, measured via levels of inflammatory biomarkers, in their blood by 75%.&lt;/p&gt;

But the reality is, the science to prove that any of these hacks work just isn't there yet, Tracey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's probably a good thing. But can we say for certain we understand how it all works? No, not yet," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Tracey believes in his own data and that of his colleagues, so he does most of these things just in case they can help &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-atlantic-diet-health-benefits-study-2024-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;prevent chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt;.

He does this because cold exposure triggers the body's &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/mental-health/fight-flight-freeze-fawn" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;fight-or-flight response&lt;/a&gt;, which evidence suggests can suppress inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that after the initial shock of the cold, ramping up the heartbeat, the parasympathetic nervous system is then activated, slowing down your breathing and heart rate. This suggests the vagus nerve is activated by cold exposure, but any role it has in reducing inflammation is still unclear, Tracey wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="418c72ae-87fb-4544-bf9e-2012dc4a19c3" data-toc-id="418c72ae-87fb-4544-bf9e-2012dc4a19c3"&gt;2) Thirty minutes of daily exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tracey works out for 30 to 45 minutes about five times a week. He does a mixture of cardio, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/strength-training-better-cardio-burning-fat-2023-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;weight and resistance training&lt;/a&gt;, stretching, and yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that exercise is good for you, but you may be surprised to learn that scientists don't fully understand the mechanisms behind the health benefits, Tracey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take running: We know that over time it reduces resting heart rate and increases heart variability (the time in between heartbeats), which indicates the heart is working efficiently. It's possible that this is a result of exercise increasing vagal tone, because it's responsible for slowing the heart down, but more research is needed to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this turns out to be true or not, working out regularly is a no-brainer investment to make in your health. "Strength training preserves muscle mass, improves metabolic function, and prevents injuries. Aerobic exercise, such as walking, cycling, or swimming, enhances cardiovascular health and endurance," Tracey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="71cf1c45-c5fb-4581-9b53-1101ef6dc44c" data-toc-id="71cf1c45-c5fb-4581-9b53-1101ef6dc44c"&gt;3) Meditation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracey meditates for 10 minutes most mornings, often using apps such as &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meditation-apps-review-headspace-calm-one-was-way-better-2021-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early research suggests that meditating can reduce inflammation, but more is needed, Tracey said. A &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735822000095" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;2022 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; that reviewed 48 randomized controlled trials involving 4,638 people found that those who meditated had fewer inflammatory biomarkers in their blood compared with those in control groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's possible that meditation could increase vagus nerve activity, which in turn reduces inflammation, Tracey said, but we lack direct proof. Regardless, he has found that regular meditation has enabled him to be more present and less reactive to things he can't control.&lt;/p&gt;

This can be assessed by a simple ultrasound examination of the liver when it is bigger and brighter than usual – that's a sure sign of fatty liver.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added, “Fatty liver disease, also known as hepatic steatosis, happens when your liver cells gather too much fat, and this fat interferes with the normal metabolic functions of the liver cells. There are two main types: one caused by drinking too much alcohol (AFLD) and the other not linked to alcohol but associated with obesity, diabetes, or metabolic dysfunction (NAFLD).”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;For the first time, traces of the West Nile  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="162576" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; have been found in mosquitoes in the UK, according to a report &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-detection-of-west-nile-virus-in-uk-mosquitoes"&gt;published this week&lt;/a&gt; by the UK Health Security Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know about the virus and the disease it causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is West Nile virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne virus first identified in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3111838/"&gt;Uganda in 1937&lt;/a&gt;. It belongs to the same viral family as dengue and yellow  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="162576" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;. The virus is most commonly transmitted by &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Culex&lt;/em&gt; mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;, particularly the species &lt;em&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mve.12802"&gt;mainly feeds on birds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birds are the primary host for West Nile virus, and the virus &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus"&gt;spreads in a cycle&lt;/a&gt; from infected birds to mosquitoes and then back to birds. Occasionally, mosquitoes can transmit the virus to humans or other animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most human infections – &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus"&gt;around 80%&lt;/a&gt; – cause no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they are usually mild: fever, fatigue, headaches, body aches and sometimes nausea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in rare cases, around one in 150 infections, the virus can cause severe illness, including encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis. Older adults, especially those over 50, are most at risk of serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus cannot normally be spread from person to person, though rare cases of transmission have occurred through &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/php/transmission/index.html"&gt;blood transfusions&lt;/a&gt; or from mother to baby during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How did it get to the UK?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the exact route isn't known, experts believe the virus may have arrived in the UK via migratory birds infected elsewhere. The mosquitoes probably picked up the virus after feeding on these birds during their northward journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detection was made as part of a routine mosquito surveillance programme run by the Animal and Plant Health Agency. Mosquitoes collected from marshlands in south-east England tested positive in PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests, which detect fragments of the virus's genetic material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that a positive PCR test doesn't necessarily mean the virus is infectious. After a mosquito becomes infected, the &lt;a href="https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(24)00230-5/fulltext"&gt;virus needs time&lt;/a&gt; – several days – to multiply inside the mosquito before it can be transmitted. And this process is highly temperature dependent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162591" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162591" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WestNileVirusParticle.jpg" alt="An illustration of a colorful virus particle" class="wp-image-162591 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WestNileVirusParticle.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WestNileVirusParticle-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WestNileVirusParticle-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162591" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of West Nile virus particles. (Science Photo Library/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can the virus spread in the UK?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK's relatively cool climate has, until now, helped keep mosquito-borne diseases at bay. At summer temperatures of around 15°C, it can take up to 100 days for the virus to develop inside a mosquito – longer than the insect's lifespan. In contrast, in hotter climates (above 30°C), this process can take just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a local outbreak to occur, there would need to be a critical mass of infected birds and mosquitoes, with enough warm weather to sustain multiple cycles of transmission. So far, that hasn't happened in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/climate-change" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73046" data-postid="162576" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; could alter the equation. With rising global temperatures and longer, hotter summers, the conditions that allow  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="162576" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; such as West Nile to spread may become more common in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's happening elsewhere?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus was once limited to Africa and the Middle East but has spread significantly in recent decades. Large outbreaks have been recorded in countries including Greece, Romania, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008042"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, Russia and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US outbreak began in New York City in 1999 when an unusual number of birds were found dead in a city zoo. A &lt;a href="https://asm.org/magazine/2021/fall/we-are-all-connected-looking-at-the-big-picture-wi"&gt;veterinary pathologist&lt;/a&gt; at the Bronx Zoo, Tracey McNamara, helped link the bird deaths to the human illnesses being reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, the virus has spread across &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/data-maps/index.html"&gt;most of the US&lt;/a&gt;, Canada and parts of South America, resulting in over 60,000 reported human cases, 28,000 hospitalisations and more than 3,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, 19 European countries reported a total of &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/infectious-disease-topics/west-nile-virus-infection/surveillance-and-disease-data/monthly-updates"&gt;1,436 local cases&lt;/a&gt;, most in men over 65, with 125 deaths. Most were in Italy, Greece and Spain – countries with hot, mosquito-friendly summers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks were also reported in birds and horses, which are both susceptible to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should UK residents be concerned?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes is noteworthy, experts emphasise that the public health risk remains very low. No human cases have been reported in the UK to date, and current summer temperatures are not yet conducive to sustained transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greater risk for most British people probably comes from travel – particularly to southern Europe, where cases are rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travellers are advised to take &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus"&gt;standard mosquito precautions&lt;/a&gt;: wear light-coloured clothing, long sleeves and trousers, and use insect repellent, especially in the evening when mosquitoes are most active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the virus is unlikely to spread widely in the UK. But as climate patterns shift, continued surveillance and public awareness will be key to staying ahead of the risk.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257295/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/15/5/e093946"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; has found the herpes simplex  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="162572" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; type 1 (HSV-1), which causes cold sores, may be linked to the development of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="162572" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea is not entirely new. Previous research has suggested there &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.1890330403"&gt;may be an association&lt;/a&gt; between HSV-1 and Alzheimer's disease, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;most common form of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can we make of these new findings? And how strong is this link? Let's take a look at the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First, what is HSV-1?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSV-1 is a neurotropic virus, meaning it can infect nerve cells, which send and receive messages to and from the brain. It's an extremely common virus. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus"&gt;World Health Organization estimates&lt;/a&gt; nearly two-thirds of the global population aged under 50 carries this virus, often unknowingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An initial infection can cause mild to severe symptoms including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="162572" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;, headache and muscle aches, and may manifest as blisters and ulcers around the mouth or lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_142288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142288" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ColdSore.jpg" alt="Cold sore" class="wp-image-142288 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ColdSore.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ColdSore-597x415.jpg 597w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ColdSore-600x417.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-142288" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cold sores are signs of HSV-1. (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_sore#/media/File:Herpes(PHIL_1573_lores).jpg"&gt;Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this, HSV-1 typically &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8923070/"&gt;lies dormant&lt;/a&gt; in the body's nervous system, sometimes reactivating due to stress or illness. During reactivation, it can cause symptoms such as cold sores, although in many people it doesn't cause any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did the new research look at?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published this week &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/15/5/e093946"&gt;in BMJ Open&lt;/a&gt;, researchers analysed data from hundreds of thousands of people drawn from a large United States health insurance dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They conducted a matched "case-control" analysis involving more than 340,000 adults aged 50 and older diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease between 2006 and 2021. Each Alzheimer's disease patient (a "case") was matched to a control without a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on factors such as age, sex and geographic region, a method designed to reduce statistical bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team then examined how many of these people had a prior diagnosis of HSV-1 and whether they had been prescribed antiviral treatment for the infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among people with Alzheimer's disease, 0.44% had a previous HSV-1 diagnosis, compared to 0.24% of controls. This translates to an 80% increased relative risk of Alzheimer's disease in those diagnosed with HSV-1, however the absolute numbers are small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found people who received antiviral treatment for HSV-1 had roughly a 17% lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to those who were untreated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not a new hypothesis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time researchers have speculated about a viral role in Alzheimer's disease. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.1890330403"&gt;Earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; have detected &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(96)10149-5/abstract"&gt;HSV-1 DNA in postmortem brain tissues&lt;/a&gt; from people who had Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory research has also shown &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.06.030"&gt;HSV-1 can trigger amyloid-beta plaque accumulation&lt;/a&gt; in nerve cells and mouse brains. Amyloid-beta plaques are one of the defining features of Alzheimer's disease pathology, so this has led to speculation that reactivation of the virus may contribute to brain inflammation or damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But importantly, previous research and the current study show associations, not proof HSV-1 causes Alzheimer's disease. These links do not confirm the virus initiates or drives disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some other important caveats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study relied on insurance claim data, which may not always reflect accurate or timely clinical diagnoses. HSV-1 is also frequently underdiagnosed, especially when symptoms are mild or absent. These points could explain why both the Alzheimer's group and the control group saw such low rates of HSV-1, when population rates of this virus &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus"&gt;are estimated to be far higher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means many carriers of HSV-1 in the study may have gone unrecorded and therefore makes the link harder to interpret clearly. The dataset also doesn't capture how often people had recurring symptoms, or the severity or duration of infections – conditions which might influence risk more directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another complicating factor is people with HSV-1 might differ in other ways from those without it. Differences in health-care access, the health of a person's &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00144-4/fulltext"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract"&gt;lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)60630-3/abstract"&gt;genetics&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract"&gt;education&lt;/a&gt; – could all influence Alzheimer's disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So should you be concerned if you have cold sores?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is no – at least not based on current evidence. Most people with HSV-1 will never develop Alzheimer's disease. The vast majority live with the virus without any serious neurological issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "herpes hypothesis" of Alzheimer's disease is an interesting area for further research, but far from settled science. This study adds weight to the conversation but doesn't offer a definitive answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease is a complex condition with &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions-do/dementia-prevention-intervention-and-care"&gt;multiple risk factors&lt;/a&gt;, including age, genetics, heart health, education, lifestyle and environmental exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infections such as HSV-1 may be one part of a larger, interconnected puzzle, but they are highly unlikely to be the sole cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the best thing to do is to focus on what we already know can help keep your brain healthy as you age. &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00184-9/abstract#:%7E:text=Emerging%20evidence%20suggests%20that%20sedentary,impairment%20and%20reduce%20dementia%20risk."&gt;Regular physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sleep-well-and-reduce-your-risk-of-dementia-and-death-2021050322508"&gt;good quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/reduce-your-risk-of-dementia/social-isolation"&gt;social engagement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/dementia-information/dementia-risk/diet-and-dementia-risk/"&gt;a balanced diet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/protect-your-brain-from-stress"&gt;managing stress&lt;/a&gt; can all support long-term brain health.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257140/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember COVID-19? That thing that’s &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00" aria-label="killed around 350 people a week in the U.S."&gt;killed around 350 people a week in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; over the past month and continues to leave more and more people with long Covid? Remember the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that’s still spreading, mutating, “varianting” and “subvarianting” and causing COVID-19? Well, nota bene or N.B., there’s a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 in town. It is called the NB.1.8.1 variant, has been causing COVID-19 surges in China, Hong King and Taiwan and is now spreading in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;XEC And LF.7 Are Past Their Peak While LP.8.1 Is Currently Dominant In The U.S.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider NB.1.8.1 to be the latest in the alphabet soup of SARS-COv-2 variants that deserves close attention. Each SARS-CoV-2 variant and subvariant is sort of like fidget spinners, those mustache tattoos on the side of finger and cup stacking. They emerge and spread quickly but then are rapidly supplanted by new variants and subvariants that spread faster. But some have caused more problems than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="color-link" href="https://github.com/neherlab/SARS-CoV-2_variant-reports/blob/main/reports/variant_report_latest_draft.md#global-overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://github.com/neherlab/SARS-CoV-2_variant-reports/blob/main/reports/variant_report_latest_draft.md#global-overview" aria-label="Global virus tracking reports"&gt;Global virus tracking reports&lt;/a&gt; from the scientific community that continues to, you know, work together and collaborate worldwide suggest that the XEC variant that &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/12/28/xec-variant-may-be-driving-silent-covid-19-surge-in-december-2024/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/12/28/xec-variant-may-be-driving-silent-covid-19-surge-in-december-2024/" target="_self" aria-label="I described for Forbes back in December 2024"&gt;I described for &lt;em data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2024/12/28/xec-variant-may-be-driving-silent-covid-19-surge-in-december-2024/"&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; back in December 2024&lt;/a&gt; is largely on its way out, except for in Japan. Meanwhile, LF.7 seems to have gone the way of the TV series &lt;em&gt;NCIS&lt;/em&gt; and already lready peaked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now the dominant variant in North America, parts of South America, much of Europe and South Africa is LP.8.1. This variant was first detected in September 2024 and by the end of 2024 was spreading around the globe. It has been effectively the variant of this past Winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NB.1.8.1 And XFG Are Currently Spreading The Fastest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Spring has seen the rise of the XFG variant, a recombinant of the LF.7 and LP.8.1.2 variants. It was first found in Quebec, Canada, in early February, and near the end of that month U.S. testing started detecting the variant. You could say that XFG has been spreading “extra freaking good” since then. By the end of April, XFG comprised about 10% of all the SARS-CoV-2 samples sequenced in North America and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the next month or so may turn out to be grudge match or perhaps a race between the XFG and NB.1.8.1 variants. Both have been spreading at similar rates. But they’ve been doing so in different parts of the world. During the same time period that XFG got a foothold or perhaps a spikehold in North America and Europe, NB.1.8.1 has become the dominant variant in Hong Kong and China. By the end of April, NB.1.8.1 already comprised 5 to 30% of the virus samples sequenced in most other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be an Alien vs. Predator situation. Each of these two variants has its competitive advantage. NB.1.8.1 seems to connect to human cells more readily than XFG while XFG seems to be able evade immune protection better. Therefore, which variant becomes more dominant where may depend on everyone’s prior exposure and vaccination status in that location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NB.1.8.1 Has Led To Surges in ER Visits And Hospitalizations In China And Hong Kong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NB.1.8.1 variant has been causing a commotion in China and Hong Kong. It’s resulted in emergency room visits and hospitalizations surging higher in those locations than it’s been in at least a year. Hong Kong authorities have been urging their resident to wear face masks in crowded public areas. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s health authorities have been stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments to respond to the NB.1.8.1 -dirven wave that they’ve seen too.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So far, there’s no clear indication that NB.1.8.1 is more likely to cause more severe health outcomes than previous SARS-CoV-2 variants. But stay tuned because more studies are needed to get a better handle on what both NB.1.8.1 and XFG can do and which may eventually come out the winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NB.1.8.1 Is Now Being Detected in the U.S.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. doesn’t currently have a organized and comprehensive surveillance system for SARS-CoV-2 since its only had like five years to set one up, right? So, it must rely on incidentally picking up new variants. That will occur if a person chooses to get tested, if that person chooses not to use a home test but instead goes to somewhere connected to a laboratory to get tested, if that laboratory either has the capability of sequencing the genetic material and chooses to do so or send the sample to a laboratory that does such a thing and if the results of the sequencing are reported to public health officials. That’s a lot of ifs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the NB.1.8.1 variant is clearly already in the U.S. It’s come up in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s airport screening program among international travelers entering via California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area airports. There have been reported NB.1.8.1 cases in Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii as well. So once can assume that the NB.1.8.1 has already got a spikehold in American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Does The NB.1.8.1 Variant Mean For Vaccination?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 vaccines available right now contain either the spike proteins (the Novavax vaccines) from a previous variant or mRNA that codes for these spike proteins (the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines). These updated vaccines were first rolled out last Fall and targeted the KP.2 variant, a descendant of the JN.1 variant. For the vaccines to be available this Fall, there had been talk of either no changes in the vaccines or updating with a more recent variant such as LP.8.1. While the currently available vaccines coudl provide some protection against NB.1.8.1, you’d get better protection with a vaccine targeting LP.8.1 because as a variant that’s emerged more recently L.P.8.1 is more similar to NB.1.8.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Is The U.S. Doing About The NB.1.8.1 Variant?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what else then is the U.S. doing about the NB.1.8.1? How about not a whole lot? Politicians have already politicized the heck out of COVID-19 control measures like face mask use. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is now talking about rolling back approval of the COVID-19 vaccines to just those over 65 years of age or with at least one chronic medical condition. With immunity from prior vaccination and infection will such rollbacks means that a greater proportion of the population will once again be more vulnerable to the latest circulating variants?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, don’t expect too much guidance from the federal government as to what to do about the NB.1.8.1 variant or COVID-19 in general, for that matter. Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic first started, the U.S. still does not have a clear long term strategy on how to deal with COVID-19 and long COVID. Don’t expect this to change with especially with all the personnel cuts that have been happening at the CDC and National Institutes of Health under the Trump Administration and Elon Musk’s DOGE, otherwise known as the Department of Government Efficiency. While SARS-CoV-2 isn’t the same threat that it was in 2020 and 2021 in large part because your immune systems is more used to the virus, the virus has not gone away or become harmless no matter what politicians may try to tell you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are several factors that influence blood pressure levels beyond just sodium intake. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy carbohydrates can provide nutrients like potassium, fiber, vitamins and minerals that support healthy blood pressure and overall heart health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include foods like fruits, beans, yogurt and oats in your diet to reap the benefits.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Approximately 1 out of 2 U.S. adults has high blood pressure, putting them at an increased risk of stroke, heart attack and other undesired outcomes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When a person is diagnosed with high blood pressure, the first diet tip that is typically given is to limit the consumption of dietary sodium. And while that is probably a good idea, there are many other nutrients that play a role. Following the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2054270/how-to-follow-the-dash-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, has been shown to lower blood pressure significantly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It emphasizes foods like whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nonfat or low-fat milk and dairy foods, lean meat, poultry, fish, nuts, seeds, legumes and healthy fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are a carb lover and have high blood pressure, the good news is that the DASH diet includes several carb-rich foods. And opting for plant-based carbohydrate-containing foods such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains may help lower blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Conversely, too many added sugars from foods like sugar-sweetened beverages are associated with higher blood pressure levels and higher hypertension risk.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Limiting ultra-processed carbs like doughnuts and candy and focusing on carbs that are more nutrient-dense is a good rule of thumb when navigating your carb choices. Here are some of the best carbs to include in your diet for healthy blood pressure levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-bananas"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Bananas  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The darling of potassium-containing foods, bananas are one of the best carb-rich foods to eat to support healthy blood pressure. Since the American Heart Association recommends that adults with &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/how-potassium-can-help-control-high-blood-pressure" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood pressure above 120/80 increase their dietary potassium intake&lt;/a&gt;, including bananas in your eating pattern is a smart choice.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, you can enjoy a banana simply by peeling it and eating it when you are on the go. But you can also whip up some &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7916777/tart-cherry-nice-cream/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tart Cherry Nice Cream&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/267647/chocolate-banana-protein-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chocolate-Banana Protein Smoothie&lt;/a&gt; to help you add in some extra potassium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-beans"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Beans  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans offer some natural carbs along with plant-based protein and a slew of vitamins and minerals, including healthy blood-pressure-supporting magnesium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, the soluble and insoluble fiber, including resistant starch naturally found in beans, may&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913519/what-are-legumes-are-they-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; help support blood pressure control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265885/no-cook-black-bean-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;No-Cook Black Bean Salad&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/274851/sheet-pan-chicken-fajita-bowls/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Sheet-Pan Chicken Fajita Bowl&lt;/a&gt; to include more beans in your diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-yogurt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Yogurt  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yogurt has become a popular food among the gut-health-supporting crowd, thanks to its live and active cultures that can help maintain a balanced microbiome. But yogurt is so much more than a probiotic-packed dairy food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to blood pressure support, data showed that, among a small sample of people with high blood pressure, the simple act of eating yogurt may help reduce those numbers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Dairy yogurt naturally contains the trifecta of the healthy blood-pressure-supporting minerals calcium, magnesium and potassium. Plus, the probiotics found in yogurt may play a separate role in reducing blood pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yogurt can be used to make various dishes, from a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7937679/mini-frozen-yogurt-parfaits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mini Frozen Yogurt Parfait&lt;/a&gt; to a refreshing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249318/fruit-yogurt-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Fruit &amp;amp; Yogurt Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, yogurt can simply be enjoyed on its own, topped with berries and a drizzle of honey.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-watermelon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Watermelon  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Watermelon is juicy, naturally sweet, and delicious. And as an added bonus, it may support healthy blood pressure levels. A meta-analysis looked into how watermelon consumption might influence heart health, focusing specifically on factors like blood pressure. Results showed that watermelon consumption significantly decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP), showing just how great this fruit can be when trying to keep blood pressure levels in in-check.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/watermelon-peach-smoothie-11703548" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Watermelon-Peach Smoothie&lt;/a&gt; for a delicious watermelon-forward sip. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-oats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Oats  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whole grains, like oats, are better options to support healthy blood pressure when it comes to grain choices. Unlike refined grains that typically only contain the endosperm of the grain, whole grains contain all three parts of the grain—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7898414/what-are-whole-grains/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the bran, endosperm and germ&lt;/a&gt;—giving these foods a nutritional edge. Whole grains contain more abundant and diverse nutrients with potential health benefits, including more fiber, vitamins and minerals compared with most of their refined counterparts. Data shows a protective association between consuming more whole grains and a lower risk for high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating plenty of fiber-rich whole grains might also reduce the risk of hypertension by giving a boost to your gut microbiota. Oats may be especially valuable because they contain a type of fiber called beta-glucans, which has been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7996442/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-oatmeal-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;both lower systolic and lower diastolic blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For simple recipes that include oats, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/268775/cinnamon-roll-overnight-oats/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cinnamon Roll Overnight Oats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/275207/peanut-butter-energy-balls/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Peanut Butter Energy Balls&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269127/baked-oatmeal-with-pears/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Baked Oatmeal with Pears&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-blueberries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Blueberries  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/blueberries-better-for-gut-health-study-11709267" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cup of blueberries &lt;/a&gt;to your daily diet may do more than offer a flavorful boost with no added sugar. One study showed that, when people ate fresh blueberries, powdered blueberries, and a control (no blueberries) over several weeks, while no major differences were found between the groups in terms of blood pressure, the study did find that fresh and powdered blueberries slightly improved levels of a compound (nitrite) that may support blood vessel health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; An older study showed that eating around 1 cup of wild blueberries (the slightly smaller blueberries that are typically found frozen in your grocery store) every day may help reduce systolic blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blueberries contain fiber, vitamins and minerals, nutrients that can help support a person's cardiovascular and overall health. And like many other naturally blue or purple foods, blueberries contain anthocyanins, a polyphenol that gives these foods that beautiful colorful hue and may account for the blood pressure benefits that have been observed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While wild blueberries contain more anthocyanins than cultivated blueberries, all blueberries pack a serious anthocyanin punch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; No matter whether you are enjoying &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7964794/blueberry-lemon-energy-balls/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Blueberry-Lemon Energy Balls&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/258456/blueberry-almond-chia-pudding/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Blueberry Almond Chia Pudding&lt;/a&gt;, they’re delicious and help support healthy blood pressure levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-orange-juice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7. Orange Juice  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sipping on a glass of 100% orange juice can do much more for you than support your immune system. Pure OJ is a natural source of potassium, one of the highlighted minerals of the DASH diet. Citrus fruits, like the oranges used to make 100% OJ, contain an antioxidant called hesperidin. This antioxidant may play a role in supporting heart health in various ways.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In one randomized controlled trial, people with either stage 1 or pre-hypertension who consumed 500 milliliters of orange juice daily for 12 weeks had significantly reduced systolic blood pressure compared with those who drank a hesperidin-free drink with the same amount of calories, vitamin C and citric acid.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sipping on a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252664/carrot-orange-juice/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Carrot Orange Juice&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/frozen-orange-ginger-turmeric-shots-11685589" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Frozen Orange-Ginger-Turmeric Shots&lt;/a&gt; can give you a boost of hesperidin in a delicious vessel.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to managing blood pressure levels, sodium might be the first thing that comes to mind. And while limiting sodium intake can be helpful, there are several other things to consider when following a DASH diet eating pattern. Namely, certain carbs like fruits, beans, yogurt and oats can provide nutrients like potassium and fiber which are crucial for heart health and blood pressure management.

And that’s what happened to 36-year-old Ashley (Aevie) Vielma. The Houston, Texas resident knew that her blood pressure was climbing, and she decided to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A History of Hypertension &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vielma was aware of her family’s history with high blood pressure. She shares that her grandmother, mother and sister, along with other family members, have been diagnosed with high blood pressure. She also lacked a consistent &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/want-lose-weight-trainers-share-192736890.html" data-ylk="slk:exercise routine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;exercise routine&lt;/a&gt;, and it didn’t help that she ate a “poor diet” that was high in salty, processed foods and saturated fats. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She also admits that &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/exactly-happens-body-don-t-161314378.html" data-ylk="slk:low-quality sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;low-quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; was to blame. “I would fall asleep with my phone and rarely got more than six hours of sleep each night,” she says, adding that she was always stressed out and dehydrated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consequently, Vielma became pre-hypertensive in her late 20s in 2015, with a reading of 125/82. “My worst number was 128/95 in 2019 during an acute period of high anxiety and stress,” she says. “My doctor began monitoring my blood pressure regularly to make sure the elevated numbers were not sustained. Otherwise, I could have needed medication or hospitalization.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/whether-youre-dealing-high-blood-154457025.html" data-ylk="slk:Whether You're Dealing With High Blood Pressure or Want to Avoid It in the Future, Here Are the 25 Best Foods to Eat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whether You're Dealing With High Blood Pressure or Want to Avoid It in the Future, Here Are the 25 Best Foods to Eat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troubling Symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;During this period, Vielma says that she would get &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1149750/shelby-deering/dizziness-causes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dizzy spells;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;dizzy spells&lt;/a&gt; from time to time when she stood up quickly. “I was always tired!” she says. “I also struggled to maintain resilience.

She started walking regularly and doing low-impact exercise, such as &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1232790/jamie-feldman/pilates-for-beginners/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pilates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Pilates&lt;/a&gt;. “I really enjoyed the classes at &lt;a href="http://www.clubpilates.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Club Pilates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Club Pilates&lt;/a&gt; and it was easy to commit to it regularly,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She also carefully listened to her doctor and began researching healthy habits in addition to the ones she was already weaving into her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Deep down, I knew that exercise alone would not be enough to reduce my blood pressure. I started getting six to eight hours of sleep regularly. I stopped screen-scrolling and set a timer on my bedroom lamp. It’s lights out at 10:00 p.m. now,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She couldn’t believe how much exercise and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/exercise-sleep-study-march-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high-quality sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;high-quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; were positively impacting her mind and body. “My mood improved and I had a lot more energy,” she reveals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then she tackled her &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/got-high-blood-pressure-try-152500361.html" data-ylk="slk:diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;. She shares that despite how much she enjoyed indulging in her favorite foods, she ultimately knew that it was taking a toll on her health. That’s when she started drinking at least two liters of water daily, which made it easier to feel satisfied instead of overeating at every meal. She looked at the salt, fat and sugar content on nutrition labels—particularly since those ingredients can affect hormone levels and the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Instead of salting her food, she used herbs to increase flavor. When she goes out to eat, she orders dressing or sauce on the side and cuts things with lemon juice to reduce the &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/6-sneaky-high-sodium-foods-000037956.html" data-ylk="slk:sodium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt;.  In general, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1316162/michelle-polizzi/high-fiber-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fibrous;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;fibrous&lt;/a&gt; veggies and &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/helpful-delicious-10-protein-sources-152717219.html" data-ylk="slk:lean proteins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;lean proteins&lt;/a&gt; are a big part of her diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, she made &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/breathwork-yoga-weve-got-details-151415570.html" data-ylk="slk:breathing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;breathing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/benefits-mindfulness-live-now-why-223433748.html" data-ylk="slk:mindfulness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt; top priorities in her life. She now uses meditation techniques to stay present, something that contributed to lowering her blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Before, I was always thinking about what happens next or how I could have done something differently or better,” she says. “Now I focus on one or two things at a time and I let the past go. This stops my mind from becoming overwhelmed, overthinking about everything little that went wrong, or all that needs to be accomplished in a week or a month.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As a result of all of her impressive efforts, her blood pressure has stayed around 112/72 since 2020. She keeps a digital blood pressure monitor in her night table to keep track of her numbers daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/want-prevent-heart-disease-huge-102500758.html" data-ylk="slk:Want to Prevent Heart Disease?

But she never feels as if she’s officially out of the woods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s definitely easier to stay active now as a Club Pilates instructor, but I will always keep monitoring my blood pressure to make sure I’m staying in a healthy range,” she says. “If I ever need additional resources, such as medication, I will pursue that option.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vielma has learned just how important blood pressure is when it comes to overall health. She advises, “If you have a family history of high blood pressure, or had an elevated reading, and are not on medication, at least invest in a monitor to track your numbers at home. A monitor is affordable and can be a lifesaving device if a crisis ever arises.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/easy-diet-tweak-lower-blood-142500007.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: This Easy Diet Tweak Can Lower Blood Pressure—and No, It’s Not Less Salt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: This Easy Diet Tweak Can Lower Blood Pressure—and No, It’s Not Less Salt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/i-lowered-my-high-blood-pressure-here-is-how-i-did-it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:‘I Had Sky-High Blood Pressure for Years, Now It's 112/72—Here's What I Did’;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;‘I Had Sky-High Blood Pressure for Years, Now It's 112/72—Here's What I Did’&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on Parade on May 25, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 23:25:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE5XV2hJblhJNnQzU1pYYTMza3RqUlNhNmtoWU5HT2cybDJrMFNQcGktUHBpMWN6YWdoeUNGZWhVdjZOSEl0bVJINjlwMmY0ODdGTjRLMXhMb3JpaTZwaFlZZWxzRjZoUHFQRkhFbEI3OHJpc1FpZVU4YnVXQTI4Rkk</guid></item><item><title>如果你想好好衰老，就养成这个习惯-新闻记者 | If You Want to Age Well, Take Up This Habit - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxORWxHZF9NQjA5OWM5U0JUV1MySkVfemdTUVN2N1ZBWFlyWExZcUlaLXBCNlRzNW5HbWxkMEM5aHRfWWF6VWFpdWl2M01HblJYVkFQYXZDb2stV24ycDlzOFU3UDFhNXVFR3kwVHVoZkYwQmtrYnJPTkM2NG1mMFRZcTlaOXI0eWFCTGVJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;span id="StoryTextTop"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seventeen years ago, cardiologist Eric Topol set out to learn why some people remain healthy well into old age while others do not—and discovered that the single most powerful key to aging well may be surprisingly simple and within everyone's reach. He and his colleagues sequenced the genomes of about 1,400 people in their 80s and older who had no major chronic diseases, people they dubbed the "Wellderly," reports the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/well/live/eric-topol-longevity-tips.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The results&lt;em&gt; w&lt;/em&gt;ere unexpected: They found no clear genetic explanation behind their healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Topol's subsequent exploration of what could account for the way in which they aged is the subject of his new book, &lt;em&gt;Super Agers: An Evidence-based Approach to Longevity&lt;/em&gt;. The key takeaway from his review of hundreds of studies? Exercise stands out as the single most important factor influencing how we age, particularly strength and resistance training. While diet and social connections matter, Topol tells the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/21/longevity-exercise-resistance-training/"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that exercise is "the only intervention in people that has shown any effect on slowing the body-wide aging clock, meaning it appears to change how rapidly we age."
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Topol now supplements the aerobic exercise he has done for decades with dumbbells, resistance bands, and bodyweight exercises at home, and credits strength training for improvements in his balance, posture, and overall fitness. He stresses that it's never too late to start strength training. "This idea that you can't build muscle or strength as you age is silly." He should know; Topol didn't start until his late 60s. The goal isn't about lifespan but healthspan, he clarifies, "our years of life that are without the major age-related diseases. ... What we can see from studies is that you can get seven to 10 years of extra healthy aging from lifestyle factors, especially exercise."  (This content was created with the help of AI.

But because it’s always exposed, it also gets hit with things like sunlight and UV rays, which can lead to sunburn, long-term skin damage, or even cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve long believed that stepping out into the sun requires ample sunscreen slathering, shade-seeking, and hat-wearing, especially between the peak hours of 12 noon and 3 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.ku.dk/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanyang Technological University&lt;/a&gt; (NTU Singapore) have made surprising new strides in our understanding of sunburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the DNA damage we’ve always associated with sunburn might not be the complete story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dna-rna-and-sunburn-damage"&gt;DNA, RNA, and sunburn damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to sunburn, the prevailing wisdom suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-can-now-collect-human-dna-from-water-air-and-basically-everywhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; damage triggers inflammation and subsequent cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this recent research suggests that the real offender might be &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rna-world-unraveling-mysteries-life-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RNA&lt;/a&gt;, not DNA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sunburn damages the DNA, leading to cell death and inflammation. So the textbooks say,” stated assistant professor Anna Constance Vind from the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at the &lt;a href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/organisations/institut-for-cellul%C3%A6r-og-molekyl%C3%A6r-medicin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But in this study we were surprised to learn that this is a result of damage to the RNA, not the DNA that causes the acute effects of sunburn.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what’s the difference between DNA and RNA? While they share similarities, the two aren’t interchangeable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNA is a more consistent molecule, whereas RNA is more transitory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A particular type of RNA, messenger RNA (mRNA), carries information from DNA to create proteins – the fundamental building blocks of cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-rna-the-basics"&gt;Understanding RNA — the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rna-world-unraveling-mysteries-life-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RNA, or ribonucleic acid&lt;/a&gt;, is like the cell’s versatile messenger, playing several key roles in keeping our bodies running smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike DNA, which holds the long-term genetic blueprint, RNA is more dynamic and can move around the cell to help build proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA essentially acts as the bridge between our genetic code and the actual production of the proteins that do all the work in our cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-we-fix-faulty-genes-before-birth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mRNA&lt;/a&gt;, or messenger RNA, is a special type of RNA that has gained a lot of attention, especially with the development of mRNA vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;mRNA carries the instructions from DNA out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, where proteins are made. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of mRNA as a temporary copy of a specific gene that tells the cell exactly which protein to produce and when. This makes mRNA incredibly important for everything from growth and repair to responding to infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mrna-and-ultraviolet-rays"&gt;mRNA and ultraviolet rays&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The importance of mRNA in our body’s response to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-does-skin-become-leathery-after-too-much-uv-light-from-sun-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UV radiation&lt;/a&gt; can’t be understated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DNA damage is serious as the mutations will get passed down to progenies of the cells, RNA damage happens all the time and does not cause permanent mutations,” Vind explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Therefore, we used to believe that the RNA is less important, as long as the DNA is intact. But in fact, damages to the RNA are the first to trigger a response to UV radiation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigating more deeply into the matter was no small task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers embarked on a study involving both mice and human skin cells to better understand the consequences of UV radiation on the skin. They discovered a consistent response in both species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zak-alpha-and-sunburn-damage"&gt;ZAK-alpha and sunburn damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA damage activates a response in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-the-cellular-mortality-timer-that-dictates-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ribosomes&lt;/a&gt; (protein complexes that interpret the mRNA to assemble proteins).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process is managed by a protein known as ZAK-alpha, which triggers what is referred to as the “ribotoxic stress response.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of it like a vigilant watchman, always on the lookout for RNA damage. When it detects any, it won’t hesitate to call for backup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the first thing the cells respond to after being exposed to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-sunbathing-help-you-lose-weight-uv-radiation-triggers-fat-burning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UV radiation&lt;/a&gt; is damage to the RNA, and that this is what triggers cell death and inflammation of the skin,” explained Professor Simon Bekker-Jensen, who was also from the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice exposed to UV radiation we found responses such as inflammation and cell death, but when we removed the ZAK gene, these responses disappeared, which means that ZAK plays a key role in the skin’s response to UV-induced damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So you could say that everything depends on this one response, which monitors all protein translations occurring,” Bekker-Jensen elaborated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The cells respond to the RNA damage, realizing that something is wrong, and this is what leads to cell death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paradigm-shift"&gt;Paradigm shift&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings question our long-held beliefs about sunburn and how our &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/skins-secret-strength-shields-against-puncture-damage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; safeguards itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It suggests that RNA damage sparks a quicker, more efficient response, which safeguards the skin from additional harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that the DNA does not control the skin’s initial response to UV radiation, but that something else does and that it does so more effectively and more quickly, is quite the paradigm shift,” reflected Vind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/01/24163120/sunburn-study_graphical-illustration_credit-Molecular-Cell-Journal_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/01/24163127/sunburn-study_graphical-illustration_credit-Molecular-Cell-Journal_1s.webp" alt="Using ZAK knockout mice, we here show that it is the RSR that is responsible for the early manifestation of UVB-induced skin inflammation and keratinocyte death and subsequent proliferation in vivo.

Thus, understanding how our skin responds at the cellular level to UV damage opens the door to innovative treatments for certain chronic skin conditions,” explained Dr. Franklin Zhong, Nanyang assistant professor at NTU’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine and a co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rewriting-the-textbooks"&gt;Rewriting the textbooks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In closing, it seems now is the time to revise our textbooks and rethink how we perceive the effects of UV radiation on our skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new knowledge turns things upside down. I think most people associate sunburn with DNA damage; it is established knowledge,” Professor Simon Bekker-Jensen concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But now we need to rewrite the textbooks, and it will affect future research on the effects of UV radiation on the skin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1097276524008840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Molecular Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 21:13:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPc2MyMVB2SW9NQkZSWGpvOFJPaTQ3eldXRmVEY3NFaHFhNHhraFlQQmQzNjBicy1CQ1BmRGtNemJHVmRZYUN3ekxuRy1aX0c0ai1yQVFkQk9oRkhqeWxBX3NDVHJuNEppeWhYOUpueWhudDE4Y3JuNnk1OUdLd1JFX0pPX2dkZE1MX2RLRTlMVVo</guid></item><item><title>在人类皮肤上发现的这种常见真菌可以消除致命的超级细菌葡萄球菌感染-好消息网络 | This Common Fungus Found on Human Skin Wipes Out Deadly Superbug Staph Infections - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxQei12Q0RETnVGQUFBQVNZSXRILWROV2lOMWt0SXlFYVpnWEY5NlBEZmFUMnVBRGNUQmpERTF6Q1FhUmxtcERxcWpsOWt4SUQxbl9Fc0Q4cnR6SnFCU29LWXpqTk5JamhZcUZxNDc3NG9TZnV4bzVZdEFJcktoZkpkUTNGelByU1Q5bE5qVm5Xd3Ffd21ESmNpcUk4YV9rUFZFb1NGY1N3RFM2WjY2WUlfX24zSkw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;University of Oregon researchers have uncovered a molecule produced by yeast living on human skin that showed potent antimicrobial properties against a pathogen responsible for a half-million hospitalizations annually in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a unique approach to tackling the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. With the global threat of drug-resistant infections, fungi inhabiting human skin are an untapped resource for identifying new antibiotics, said Caitlin Kowalski, a postdoctoral researcher at the UO who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Described in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(25)00371-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a paper published&lt;/a&gt; last month in Current Biology, the common skin fungus Malassezia gobbles up oil and fats on human skin to produce fatty acids that selectively eliminate Staphylococcus aureus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One out of every three people have Staphylococcus aureus harmlessly dwelling in their nose, but the bacteria are a risk factor for serious infections when given the opportunity: open wounds, abrasions and cuts. They’re the primary cause of skin and soft tissue infections known as staph infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staphylococcus aureus is also a hospital superbug notorious for being resistant to current antibiotics, elevating the pressing need for new medicines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of studies that identify new antibiotic structures, Kowalski said, “but what was fun and interesting about ours is that we identified (a compound) that is well-known and that people have studied before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compound is not toxic in normal lab conditions, but it can be potent in conditions that replicate the acidic environment of healthy skin. “I think that’s why in some cases we may have missed these kinds of antimicrobial mechanisms,” Kowalski added, “because the pH in the lab wasn’t low enough. But human skin is really acidic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Stanford Scientists Transform Ubiquitous Skin Bacteria into a Topical Vaccine Against Tetanus" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/stanford-scientists-transform-ubiquitous-skin-bacterium-into-a-topical-vaccine-against-tetanus/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Stanford Scientists Transform Ubiquitous Skin Bacteria into a Topical Vaccine Against Tetanus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans play host to a colossal array of microorganisms, known as the microbiome, but we know little about our resident fungi and their contributions to human health, Kowalski said. The skin microbiome is of special interest to her because while other body parts crowd dozens of different fungi, the skin is dominantly colonized by one kind known as Malassezia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malassezia can be associated with cases of dandruff and eczema, but it’s considered relatively harmless and a normal part of skin flora. The yeast has evolved to live on mammalian skin, so much so that it can’t make fatty acids without the lipids—oils and fats—secreted by skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the abundance of Malassezia found on us, they remain understudied, Kowalski said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The skin is a parallel system to what’s happening in the gut, which is really well-studied,” &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1082018" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;she said in a media release&lt;/a&gt;. “We know that the intestinal microbiome can modify host compounds and make their own unique compounds that have new functions. Skin is lipid-rich, and the skin microbiome processes these lipids to also produce bioactive compounds. So what does this mean for skin health and diseases?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHECK THIS OUT:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="Itching Solution: New Approach Could Treat Inflammatory Skin Conditions Like Eczema with ‘Huge Benefits’" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/itching-solution-new-approach-could-treat-inflammatory-skin-conditions-like-eczema-with-huge-benefits/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Itching Solution: New Approach Could Treat Inflammatory Skin Conditions Like Eczema with ‘Huge Benefits’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at human skin samples from healthy donors and experiments done with skin cells in the lab, Kowalski found that the fungal species Malassezia sympodialis transformed host lipids into antibacterial hydroxy fatty acids. Fatty acids have various functions in cells but are notably the building blocks for cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hydroxy fatty acids synthesized by Malassezia sympodialis were detergent-like, destroying the membranes of Staphylococcus aureus and causing its internal contents to leak away. The attack prevented the colonization of Staphylococcus aureus on the skin and ultimately killed the bacteria in as little as 15 minutes, Kowalski said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the fungus isn’t a magic bullet. After enough exposure, the staph bacteria eventually became tolerant to the fungus, as they do when clinical antibiotics are overused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at their genetics, the researchers found that the bacteria evolved a mutation in the Rel gene, which activates the bacterial stress response. Similar mutations have been previously identified in patients with Staphylococcus aureus infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMAZING&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="14-year-old Invents Soap for Treating Skin Cancer and Wins Top Honor as America’s Top Young Scientist" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/14-year-old-invents-soap-for-treating-skin-cancer-and-wins-top-honor-as-americas-top-young-scientist/" rel="bookmark"&gt;14-year-old Invents Soap for Treating Skin Cancer and Wins Top Honor as America’s Top Young Scientist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings show that a bacteria’s host environment and interactions with other microbes can influence its susceptibility to antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s growing interest in applying microbes as a therapeutic, such as adding bacteria to prevent the growth of a pathogen,” Kowalski said. “But it can have consequences that we have not yet fully understood. Even though we know antibiotics lead to the evolution of resistance, it hasn’t been considered when we think about the application of microbes as a therapeutic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the discovery adds a layer of complexity for drug discovery, Kowalski said she is excited about the potential of resident fungi as a new source for future antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying the antimicrobial fatty acids took three years and a cross-disciplinary effort. Kowalski collaborated with chemical microbiologists at McMaster University to track down the compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SKIN HEALING CURE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="New ‘Super Melanin’ Cream Heals Skin From Sun Exposure And Even Chemical Burns" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/super-melanin-cream-heals-skin-from-sun-and-chemical-burns/" rel="bookmark"&gt;New ‘Super Melanin’ Cream Heals Skin From Sun Exposure And Even Chemical Burns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was like finding a needle in a haystack but with molecules you can’t see,” said Kowalski’s adviser, Matthew Barber, an associate professor of biology in the College of Arts and Sciences at the UO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kowalski is working on a follow-up study that goes deeper into the genetic mechanisms that led to the antibiotic tolerance. She is also preparing to launch her own lab to further investigate the overlooked role of the skin microbiome, parting from Barber’s lab after bringing fungi into focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections are a major human health threat and one that, in some ways, is getting worse,” Barber said. “We still have a lot of work to do in understanding the microorganisms but also finding new ways that we can possibly treat or prevent those infections.”&lt;/p&gt;

Now and then, things like stress, illness or injury can trigger it, bringing on a cold sore in some people. But this same virus – called herpes simplex virus type 1 – may also play an important role in something far more serious: Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 30 years ago, my colleagues and I made a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(96)10149-5/abstract"&gt;surprising discovery&lt;/a&gt;. We found that this cold sore virus can be present in the brains of older people. It was the first clear sign that a virus could be quietly living in the brain, which was long thought to be completely germ-free – protected by the so-called “blood-brain barrier”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we discovered something even more striking. People who have a certain version of a gene (called APOE-e4) that increases their risk of Alzheimer’s, and who have been infected with this virus, have a risk that is &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(96)10149-5/abstract"&gt;many times greater&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate further, we studied brain cells that we &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394007010786?via%3Dihub"&gt;infected with the virus&lt;/a&gt;. They produced the same abnormal proteins (amyloid and tau) found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that the virus stays mainly dormant in the body for years – possibly decades. But later in life, as the immune system gets weaker, it can enter the brain and reactivate there. When it does, it will damage brain cells and trigger inflammation. Over time, repeated flare-ups could gradually cause the kind of damage that leads to Alzheimer’s in some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We later found the virus’s DNA &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18973185/"&gt;inside the sticky clumps of these proteins&lt;/a&gt;, which are found in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Even more encouragingly, antiviral treatments reduced this damage in the lab, suggesting that drugs might one day help to slow or even prevent the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956964/"&gt;Large population studies&lt;/a&gt; by others found that severe infections, specifically with the cold sore virus, was a strong predictor of Alzheimer’s, and that specific antiviral treatment &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34136638/"&gt;reduced the risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research didn’t stop there. We &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3233/JAD-220287"&gt;wondered if&lt;/a&gt; other viruses that lie dormant in the body might have similar effects – such as the one responsible for chickenpox and shingles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shingles vaccine offers another clue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we studied health records from hundreds of thousands of people in the UK, we saw something interesting. People who had shingles had only a slightly higher risk of developing dementia. Yet those who had the shingles vaccine were &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34625411/"&gt;less likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop dementia at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833335"&gt;new Stanford University-led study&lt;/a&gt; gave similar results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This supported our long-held proposal that preventing common infections could lower the risk of Alzheimer’s. Consistently, studies by others showed that infections were indeed a risk and that some other vaccines were protective against Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scisignal.ado6430"&gt;then explored&lt;/a&gt; how risk factors for Alzheimer’s such as infections and head injuries could trigger the hidden virus in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an advanced 3D model of the brain with a dormant herpes infection, we found that when we introduced other infections or simulated a brain injury, the cold sore virus reactivated and caused damage similar to that seen in Alzheimer’s. But when we used a treatment to reduce inflammation, the virus stayed inactive, and the damage didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this suggests that the virus that causes cold sores could be an important contributor to Alzheimer’s, especially in people with certain genetic risk factors. It also opens the door to possible new ways of preventing the disease, such as vaccines or antiviral treatments that stop the virus from waking up and harming the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began as a link between cold sores and memory loss has grown into a much bigger story – one that may help us understand, and eventually reduce, the risk of one of the most feared diseases of our time.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254656/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254656/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

&lt;figure id="article-featured-image" class="article-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/24117153-e1748203716576.jpg" alt="A screengrab from a Facebook video posted by Nicole Dyer-Griffith on May 25. - "&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A screengrab from a Facebook video posted by Nicole Dyer-Griffith on May 25. - &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FORMER Miss Universe TT Nicole Dyer-Griffith says her latest medical check-up has brought her positive news in respect of her ongoing battle with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She made these comments in video posted on Facebook on May 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyer-Griffith, a former senator, is the wife of former police commissioner/national security minister/National Transformation Alliance (NTA) leader Gary Griffith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2024, Dyer-Griffith shocked many as she appeared in a video with a bald head to announce she was diagnosed with stage-three inflammatory breast cancer in April 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a video taken in her vehicle and shared to her social media on March 14, she said she had completed her radiation treatment and was taking hormone suppressants. At a medical check-up, she told her doctors she was getting headaches and, just to be safe, an MRI was scheduled for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those MRI results subsequently showed she had a tumour in her brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest video, Dyer-Griffith said. "The stereotactic radiation surgery (SRS) was completed and went quite well."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a precise form of external beam radiation therapy used to treat abnormalities in the brain and spine, including cancer, epilepsy, and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It delivers a highly focused dose of radiation to the target area while minimising damage to surrounding healthy tissues. SRS is often a viable alternative to traditional surgery when the tumour is inaccessible or too risky for surgery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added, "I also did my post treatment PET scan which is to see if there is an residue of the disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scan is a medical imaging technique that uses radioactive substances (radiotracers) to visualise and measure changes in metabolic processes within the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scans are helpful in diagnosing and planning treatment for various conditions, including cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyer-Griffith smiled as she said,"Thus far it was clear. So from stage-three breast cancer to stage-four brain cancer to a clear PET scan...God is absolutely fabulous."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She acknowledged this is a journey and challenges lay ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239585826-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyer-Griffith said she was confidently taking this journey, one step at a time and one day at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told other people facing similar challenges that they remained in her thoughts and prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyer-Griffith and Griffith were unavailable for comment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

Compared to non-practitioners, BDSM participants were more likely to have secure attachment styles, lower rejection sensitivity, and higher levels of well-being. These findings challenge the persistent social stigma that often links BDSM with emotional dysfunction or psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was designed to replicate and extend the work of a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jsm.12192" target="_blank"&gt;2013 study by Wismeijer and Van Assen&lt;/a&gt;, which reported that BDSM practitioners showed more functional psychological traits than non-practitioners. Despite the social stigma surrounding BDSM—an umbrella term encompassing practices involving consensual power exchange, sensation play, and role-play—the original study found no evidence of psychological harm associated with these sexual interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the field lacked high-powered replication studies, especially outside of Western European countries. To address this gap, the researchers set out to test whether the original findings held true in a large, diverse Spanish sample and to explore additional factors such as sexual orientation, gender identity, and depth of BDSM experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct this study, the researchers recruited 1,884 Spanish adults through social media, online networks, and a sex toy retailer’s newsletter. About 60% of participants identified as BDSM practitioners, while the remaining 40% did not. The sample was diverse in terms of gender and sexual orientation: 58% were cisgender women, 35% cisgender men, and 6% identified as transgender or gender non-conforming. Over half identified as part of the LGBTQIA+ community. Participants were between the ages of 18 and 68, with a median age of 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a series of validated self-report questionnaires that assessed their personality traits (based on the Big Five model), attachment styles, rejection sensitivity, and subjective well-being. They were also asked about their BDSM practices, including their roles (dominant, submissive, switch), experiences related to power or pain dynamics (top, bottom, switch), and the frequency of their engagement in BDSM activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a series of statistical analyses to compare BDSM practitioners with non-practitioners. They controlled for demographic factors such as age, gender, and education. They also explored whether specific roles within BDSM (e.g., dominant vs. submissive) were associated with unique psychological patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results strongly supported the original 2013 findings. BDSM practitioners were more likely than non-practitioners to report secure attachment styles, particularly among those who identified as dominants. These individuals also had higher scores on conscientiousness and openness to experience, and lower scores on neuroticism and rejection sensitivity—traits often linked to emotional stability and interpersonal effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the differences were not uniform across all roles, dominants consistently showed the most functional psychological profiles. They reported higher extraversion and well-being, and lower neuroticism and rejection sensitivity, especially among women. Submissives and switches generally fell in between dominants and non-practitioners on most measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, BDSM practitioners also reported higher levels of well-being, with dominants again standing out as the most satisfied group. This supports prior research suggesting that BDSM, for many, is not simply a set of sexual practices but also a source of empowerment, connection, and self-expression. Practitioners with more experience in BDSM reported even greater psychological benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important finding was that the psychological structure—how attachment styles, personality traits, and well-being relate to one another—was consistent across both BDSM practitioners and non-practitioners. This suggests that while BDSM practitioners may differ in levels of certain traits, the basic architecture of their psychological functioning is no different from the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that sexual orientation and gender identity played a role in shaping psychological characteristics. For example, bi/pansexual individuals tended to report lower discomfort with emotional closeness compared to other groups, and transgender and gender non-conforming individuals scored higher on openness and rejection sensitivity. These intersections point to the importance of considering broader social contexts and minority stress when interpreting psychological data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers emphasized that their findings contradict the outdated notion that BDSM is a sign of psychological damage or deviance. While BDSM has historically been pathologized—often viewed as the result of childhood trauma or emotional dysfunction—the data did not support this view. Instead, BDSM appears to be a variation of healthy sexual expression, often associated with traits that promote personal and relational well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study was not without its limitations. Its cross-sectional design means that causal relationships cannot be determined. For instance, it remains unclear whether engaging in BDSM leads to greater well-being or whether individuals with certain psychological traits are more drawn to BDSM. The researchers also used self-reported data, which can be subject to bias. Additionally, the sample was not representative of the broader population, given its reliance on self-selection and social networks for recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study offers compelling evidence that BDSM practitioners are psychologically well-adjusted individuals. It reinforces the need for healthcare professionals, educators, and the public to reconsider harmful stereotypes and assumptions about kink communities. The researchers call for more replication studies, particularly those that use longitudinal designs and more representative samples, to deepen our understanding of how BDSM fits into the broader landscape of human sexuality and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2024.2364891" target="_blank"&gt;Not Twisted, Just Kinky: Replication and Structural Invariance of Attachment, Personality, and Well-Being Among BDSM Practitioners&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Oscar Lecuona, Olga Martínez-Barajas, Alejandro Gimeno-Martín, Alejandra Hernansaiz, Carla Carrillo-Molina, Rodrigo Alcolea-Cantero, Raquel Rodríguez-Carvajal, and Sara de Rivas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 18:06:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOWU9pSEhVQUV3Ykw2dldRQkFOcHM3dDV4YUp1WkNrUmh0Q1lVQlZ6Q0hZSEtpal9iS3JxMXVpOGxnSXhvWWQ4QlFGdFFoN052NkRDbEhHUXdUdTV2SGVfRmJ6R1N1VlBMdHgwSi1SNF9DSlBuT2NoQm9oWUhFbzd6Ujh1eC02UDh5WWhoZWlhUllVdnljalhlNUMwX0dqNEE</guid></item><item><title>由于疫苗接种率低，科罗拉多州部分地区的麻疹风险与西德克萨斯州一样高-《丹佛邮报》 | Parts of Colorado face measles risk as high as West Texas due to low vaccination rates - The Denver Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxOc0ppX1NVWkJDRk5heFFZbnN2VldjLW0zWHAzYzNHMmNNbFI3OEtDS2hnVDI0OHFRNzg5b2xPdW5sMWpaZl82Tlk1TFhCX3FPVWpjbFQ5T0UwSElJUklnUWxTbjlKeEF4cGktM0NFRzhzcWRtVHZQQm9KMFo0UVZVV0RQOHM4U01ieW5UN9IBkgFBVV95cUxQbS1wamZHeldCUHlIaklscDVtWUUzNFo2Z3lSdjhMYkYzRzQ2aTJES1ppeGhuejRTM3RkOXZqanpQUkQ1ak4wZTFuMl9FekFLLVYxZDRsMTlQeGVCQ2ROdjFpMGxySVNpTzk2QUE3WkxSUk1CV3hxUk90RDVFTWVxQlhYMF9FMzBzS2xzTGFBaHBIdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parts of Colorado are as vulnerable to measles as West Texas, where the highly contagious virus has infected hundreds of people and killed two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado has recorded more confirmed measles cases so far this year than it has in almost two decades. Rural pockets of the state are undervaccinated, and large counties have seen their protection erode since the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country as a whole has more than three times as many measles cases already this year as it did in all of 2024, and federal health officials are pushing vitamins as an alternative to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think what’s clear is, we’re going backwards,” said Beth Carlton, chair of environmental and occupational health at the &lt;a href="https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/"&gt;Colorado School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re creating conditions where we have the right ingredients for measles to spread.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statewide, about 94% of Colorado students in preschool through 12th grade were up-to-date on their measles shots in the 2023-2024 school year, creating an imperfect but relatively solid wall around people with compromised immune systems and babies too young for the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that average conceals more-vulnerable pockets in the state: in two counties, one-quarter of children didn’t have their shots, and in eight schools, less than half did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 25 years, communities typically didn’t see any consequences from those low rates. Measles no longer circulated in the United States, and outbreaks popped up only when travelers brought the virus back. While public health officials warned that declining vaccination rates could set the stage for the virus to start circulating widely again, Colorado reported only six people who had measles &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/measles"&gt;between 2014 and 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those days may be over. As of Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;measles had infected 1,046 people&lt;/a&gt; across the United States, and public health officials have started to worry that the outbreak could last into 2026.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Colorado has confirmed five measles cases since January, making this the first time since 1996 that the state had more than two in a single year. Those infected include an &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/03/31/colorado-measles-pueblo-outbreak-public-health-mmr-vaccine/"&gt;adult in Pueblo County&lt;/a&gt;; a Denver baby and &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/23/denver-measles-case-colorado/"&gt;an unidentified person&lt;/a&gt; who lives in the same household; a &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/25/colorado-measles-denver-lakewood-exposure/"&gt;Denver adult&lt;/a&gt;; and an adult in Archuleta County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health officials also warned the public last week about two infected and contagious travelers who recently visited Colorado: a person from another state who &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/05/21/measles-pueblo-hotel-holiday-inn/"&gt;stayed at a Pueblo hotel on May 9 and 10&lt;/a&gt;, and an international traveler who &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/05/22/denver-measles-dia-colorado-quality-inn-airport/"&gt;passed through Denver International Airport and stayed at a nearby hotel&lt;/a&gt; on May 13 and 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the state’s confirmed measles patients got sick after visiting Mexico, though the &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/08/denver-health-measles-emergency-room/"&gt;Archuleta County adult hadn’t traveled&lt;/a&gt;, which raises concerns about missed cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, uptake of routine vaccines &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/155/4/e2024068244/201312/COVID-19-and-Completion-of-Select-Routine"&gt;still hadn’t rebounded from a pandemic dip&lt;/a&gt; as of 2023, and resistance to COVID-19 vaccines led to increased skepticism of shots that once had bipartisan support. State legislatures have considered expanding exemptions to school vaccination requirements or &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/state-lawmakers-see-new-opportunities-to-pass-vaccine-exemptions-after-trumps-return"&gt;forbidding “discrimination” based on being unvaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, and a bill in Minnesota would have classified one type of vaccine technology as a &lt;a href="https://www.twincities.com/2025/04/24/umn-disease-research-center-to-launch-vaccine-integrity-project/"&gt;“weapon of mass destruction.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials in the Trump administration have been lukewarm in endorsing the shots as a way to stem the current outbreak. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has promoted misinformation that vaccines cause autism and falsely claimed that vitamin A could prevent measles, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/us/politics/kennedy-vaccines-research.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Dk8.NeR6.HBiMh-SBxZlz&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;framed vaccination as a personal choice, with no clear correct answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two shots of the measles vaccine are about 97% effective in preventing infection and virtually eliminate the risk of serious complications, such as pneumonia and neurological damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At current vaccination rates, a series of simulations published by the Journal of the American Medical Association gave measles an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833361?guestAccessKey=5d34848e-bd4f-4cba-ac24-685fadb45a1c&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=postup_jn&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_alert-jama&amp;amp;utm_content=olf&amp;amp;utm_term=042425&amp;amp;utm_adv="&gt;83% chance of reestablishing a permanent presence&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, with an estimated 850,000 cases and 2,500 deaths projected over the next 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But rates would only have to rise about 5% to prevent reestablishment and knock cases down to a few thousand in the next quarter century, the scientists running the simulation said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models never reflect reality perfectly, but seeing such a high risk from a simulation that used relatively conservative estimates is worrisome, Carlton said. As outbreaks continue to spread in other states, and possibly in countries that have lost American aid for their health systems, Colorado communities will face an increased risk of imported cases that could turn into outbreaks if they land among undervaccinated people, she said. Essentially, they’ll roll the dice more often, and their luck could eventually run out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, parents who weren’t sure about measles shots may opt for them when the virus no longer seems like a far-off risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lauren Brave, a pediatrician in Boulder County, said a few already are starting to make that calculation. Two families in her practice who’d decided not to vaccinate their children against measles recently changed their minds, and others have said they’ll come in for the shots if cases start popping up closer to home, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All parents are just trying to protect their kids, so when people hear scary things online, it plays to their natural parental fears,” she said. “It’s a long game” to get children vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Striving for herd immunity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health officials cite 95% vaccine coverage as the threshold for herd immunity — the point where a virus can’t find new hosts to allow it to jump from one susceptible person to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most things in nature, however, herd immunity isn’t quite that clear-cut, said Dr. David Higgins, a pediatrician and preventive medicine specialist on the &lt;a href="https://www.cuanschutz.edu/"&gt;University of Colorado’s Anschutz Medical Campus&lt;/a&gt;. A community where 90% of children are up-to-date on their measles shots isn’t as protected as one where 95% are, but it is safer than a community where 80% are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a light switch, on or off. It’s more of a dimmer,” he said of vaccination levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 23 large and small counties scattered around Colorado, K-12 students met the herd immunity threshold in the 2023-2024 school year, which was the most recent with data. In the Denver area, Broomfield, Adams and Douglas counties had at least 95% of their students vaccinated against measles, while Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe counties fell between 93% and 95%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the opposite end, in 13 counties, at least one in 10 K-12 students didn’t have full protection against measles, and in Hinsdale and Dolores counties in the state’s southwest corner, more than one in four didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual rates may be lower, because states collect vaccination data through their public schools, and rates tend to be lower for kids attending private schools or who are homeschooled, said Dr. Michelle Fiscus, chief medical officer at the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://www.immunizationmanagers.org/"&gt;Association of Immunization Managers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracy Beanland, director of &lt;a href="https://dolocnty.colorado.gov/public-health"&gt;Dolores County Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, said last year’s rates don’t reflect progress the county has made since 2023. In the current school year, all children were up to date on their measles shots, she said. The county has about 600 children attending public schools, which makes large swings in the vaccination rate more likely than in urban areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Hinsdale County didn’t respond to questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even county and district averages can conceal unprotected pockets. In Saguache County in the San Luis Valley, about 88% of students were up-to-date on their measles shots, but only 60% were in tiny &lt;a href="https://www.moffatschools.org/"&gt;Moffat School District C-2&lt;/a&gt; — and only 20% were in the district’s &lt;a href="https://www.crestone-charter-school.org/"&gt;Crestone Charter School&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vulnerable pockets don’t only appear in rural areas. While almost 96% of K-12 students in Adams County had their measles shots, at &lt;a href="https://ebabrighton.org/"&gt;Elmwood Baptist Academy&lt;/a&gt; in Brighton, only 30% did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern existed in Texas. In Gaines County — the epicenter of the current outbreak — about 90% of public school students were up-to-date on their measles vaccine by middle school, but fewer than half of students had their shots in a few individual schools. (Texas only publishes vaccination rates for kindergarteners and seventh graders.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communities can nudge people who don’t have strong feelings about vaccines in either direction, Higgins said. People who send their children to the same school or child care center tend to have similar media diets, meaning that interacting with other parents can reinforce either facts or misinformation, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that social norms within communities are strong motivators for health behavior,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Rates drop in large counties&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have fallen in Colorado’s larger counties since the 2017-2018 school year, with most of the decline happening since the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 16 counties with at least 50,000 residents, eight saw a statistically significant drop in their K-12 measles vaccination rate. Six remained stable, and Boulder and Garfield counties increased their vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boulder County started working with neighboring counties and the &lt;a href="https://www.bvsd.org/"&gt;Boulder Valley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.svvsd.org/"&gt;St. Vrain Valley&lt;/a&gt; school districts on measles back in 2019, which was the last time the United States had major outbreaks, said Stephanie Faren, manager of the communicable disease and emergency management division at &lt;a href="https://bouldercounty.gov/departments/public-health/"&gt;Boulder County Public Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 90.7% of students across Boulder County had their measles shots during the 2017-2018 school year, but in the most recent year, 94.9% did, putting herd immunity in reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the improvement was on paper, as the department got a more accurate count of children who’d received their shots, but part represented a real change, Faren said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminding parents when their children were due for shots was an effective measure, because measles just wasn’t top of mind for everyone, Faren said. The health departments also worked with health care providers so they’d feel prepared to field their patients’ questions and concerns, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Boulder was one of the first areas where vaccine hesitancy and sort of a natural health movement started,” she said. “But it’s also a highly educated community with a lot of health-minded people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arapahoe and El Paso counties had the steepest drops in vaccination rates among the large Colorado counties, to about 93% and 90%, respectively. (Rural counties see more fluctuation because of their small populations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristi Durbin, immunization and travel division manager at &lt;a href="https://www.elpasocountyhealth.org/"&gt;El Paso County Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, said parents delayed routine health care during the pandemic. The department has been sending reminders to families that are behind on shots and offering vaccine clinics at schools and community organizations, to make it easier to catch up, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“EPCPH saw many 13-year-olds coming in for vaccines they should have received around 11, or 6- and 7-year-olds who missed their kindergarten routine immunizations, which includes the (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine,” she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;“Make it as convenient as possible”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some families fell behind on shots because they have difficulty finding a provider who stocks all the vaccines their children need, said Kaitlin Wolff, immunization nurse manager for &lt;a href="https://www.arapahoeco.gov/your_county/county_departments/public_health_department/index.php"&gt;Arapahoe County Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. They’ve also seen an increase in parents who aren’t opposed to vaccines, but want to set their own schedule — though that trend may be reversing now that they’re hearing about children hospitalized because of measles, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we don’t have a disease circulating, a slight delay presents no problem,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arapahoe County’s health department has worked with schools for years to bring the shots to children whose parents don’t have the time or transportation to take them to a doctor, Wolff said. They’ve also reached out to religious communities and partnered with community health workers, who help people in specific populations to navigate the health system, to reach immigrants who speak a language other than English or Spanish, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As humans, we are most impacted (in our decisions) by people close to us,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines may not be a family’s top priority, so some of the most successful efforts bring the shots to places that are already meeting their other needs, said Sarah Waraniak, program director of &lt;a href="https://www.immunizecolorado.org/"&gt;Immunize Colorado&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the group and its partners gave out about 7,300 shots at more than 70 clinics around the Denver area, including a food box distribution site off Colfax Avenue and “community baby showers” where low-income mothers-to-be can pick up gear, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to make it as convenient as possible,” Waraniak said. “We find that does tend to drive rates up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right strategies to boost vaccination rates will depend on families’ reasons for not getting their children vaccinated, said Fiscus, with the Association of Immunization Managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outreach geared toward specific religious groups, such as Orthodox Jews in New York or the Amish community in Pennsylvania, has helped persuade members to accept the vaccine during outbreaks. In other places, such as Chicago, offering vaccine clinics during the school day helped catch kids up, because parents didn’t have to worry about taking time off work or finding transportation, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You really have to be using micro-level data and planning,” Fiscus said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal funding cuts to public health will limit state and local agencies’ ability to do that sort of work, though, said Carlton, with the Colorado School of Public Health. So will the &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/03/19/cu-anschutz-colorado-research-nih-grants-vaccines-alzheimers/"&gt;Trump administration’s decision to end federal support&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/05/05/denver-vaccine-hesitancy-study-stopped-trump/"&gt;research on vaccine hesitancy and trust&lt;/a&gt;, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;You’d have a hard time finding any serious endurance athlete in 2025 who thinks protein doesn’t matter. Gone are the carb-centric days of pasta and Gatorade and nothing else. But figuring out how much protein runners, cyclists, and other endurance junkies actually need—and when they need it—remains a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve grappled with these questions a few times recently—in a piece &lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/nutrition/new-rules-of-protein/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;busting some common protein myths&lt;/a&gt;, and in another discussing the idea of &lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/nutrition/how-much-protein-after-workout/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;maximum protein &lt;/a&gt;intake. But now a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40117058/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;new review paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Sports Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, from a research team led by Oliver Witard of King’s College London, offers a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge. Witard and his colleagues focus on two key questions. First, how much protein do endurance athletes need on a daily basis to stay healthy and optimize long-term training adaptations? And second, what role can the tactical use of protein play in speeding up short-term recovery and boosting performance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protein for the Long Term&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government guidelines currently recommend getting at least 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (g/kg) each day. For someone who weighs 150 pounds, that works out to 55 grams of protein. For reference, a standard 5-ounce can of tuna has about 20 grams of protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main problems with this guideline, however. First, it’s intended to be the minimum required to stay healthy, not the optimal amount to maximize performance. Second, it was formulated using a measurement technique that involves tracking the amount of nitrogen being consumed and excreted from the body, which some scientists believe underestimates protein needs. A newer approach called the “&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18203885/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;indicator amino acid oxidation method&lt;/a&gt;,” which involves labeling one specific type of amino acid with a carbon isotope to see how quickly it’s burned, gives higher numbers and is also more practical for testing specific populations like athletes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual argument for getting lots of protein is that it provides the building blocks—amino acids—for building new muscle. That’s important for strength training, but endurance athletes need it for other reasons. One is that these building blocks are used to repair the muscle damage incurred by hard training: the longer and harder you run, the more damage you incur, and more protein you presumably need for repairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During prolonged exercise, your body also starts burning amino acids for fuel. The amounts are generally small, and how much you burn depends on the nature of the exercise and what else you’re eating, but in some cases 5 to 10 percent of the fuel you need for a given workout is provided by protein. If you’re training hard, you’ll need to eat extra protein to replace those losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some more subtle possibilities, too. Muscle isn’t the only part of the body that’s built from protein. One of the key adaptations athletes gain from endurance training is an increase in the amount of protein in the mitochondria, where cellular energy is generated. The more protein in the mitochondria, the more efficiently it creates energy. A few studies have sought to  figure out whether eating more protein boosts the mitochondrial response to exercise. The results so far haven’t been convincing, but it’s still an open question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witard and his colleagues pooled data from various indicator amino acid studies to assess protein needs for endurance athletes under various conditions. Here are some of the key numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2704896" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2704896" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/protein-needs.png?width=730" alt="bar graph showing protein needs for endurance athletes" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/protein-needs.png?width=300 300w, https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/protein-needs.png?width=768 768w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="pom-caption "&gt;&lt;span class="article__caption"&gt;Data from indicator amino acid studies suggests that endurance athletes need more protein than untrained people.&lt;/span&gt; (Photo: Adapted from Sports Medicine)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indicator amino acid data suggests that even untrained people need about 1.2 g/kg of protein per day, 50 percent more than the FDA’s recommended daily intake of 0.8 g/kg. And endurance athletes need another 50 percent more than untrained people, with a level of 1.8 g/k/g ensuring that 95 percent of people are getting all the protein their bodies can use. In comparison, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37573015/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; using the same indicator amino acid method find that resistance-trained athletes need somewhere between 1.5 and 2.0 g/kg per day, raising the possibility that endurance athletes might actually need &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; protein than lifters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an important point to bear in mind, though: endurance athletes also tend to eat a lot more than the average person, which means they automatically get more protein. &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/usual/Usual_Intake_gender_WWEIA_2017_March%202020.pdf" data-afl-p="0"&gt;Current protein intake&lt;/a&gt; among American adults averages 1.25 g/kg for men and 1.09 g/kg for women, pretty close to the overall target of 1.2 g/kg for untrained people. In comparison, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27710150/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found that endurance athletes average 1.4 to 1.5 g/kg—not quite at the 1.8 g/kg level, but not that far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some other nuances in that graph. Data on male-female differences is very sparse, but there are some hints that women might require more than men relative to their body weight. That might be particularly true during the luteal phase of the &lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/how-your-menstrual-cycle-affects-recovery-from-training/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;menstrual cycle&lt;/a&gt;, since progesterone can affect protein burning. Witard and his colleagues make a blanket recommendation that both male and female endurance athletes should aim for 1.8 g/kg, but they throw in the speculative possibility that females “may consider” upping it to 1.9 g/kg during the luteal phase of their cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Short-Term Protein Tactics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big surprise in the data above is that endurance athletes seem to use more protein on their rest days than on training days. This finding has popped up in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38603808/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;a few studies&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s definitely not what the scientists were expecting. It’s possible that there’s some quirk of metabolism that’s skewing the measurements used to assess protein needs when you try to compare exercise and non-exercise days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s also possible that the effect is real—that when you give your body a break, its repair and adaptation mechanisms &lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/nutrition/hungrier-on-rest-days/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;kick into overdrive&lt;/a&gt; and thus use more protein than usual. If this is true, it’s an argument for upping your protein intake on rest days: Witard and co. suggest aiming for 2.0 g/kg. And on a more fundamental level, it’s an argument for including true rest days in your training program periodically, since they seem to trigger recovery processes that don’t happen on normal training days. At this point, I’d say the jury is still out on whether the effect is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, the researchers suggest aiming for 0.5 g/kg of protein following exercise to help repair any muscle damage incurred during the workout. For a 150-pound person, that’s 34 grams of protein, which is what you’d get in a substantial meal with a good protein source. How soon is “after exercise”? I don’t think there’s any convincing data that says it has to be immediately after. Your next meal is fine—unless your workout was after dinner and you’re planning to head to bed, in which case you should make a special effort to get some protein in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data also suggests that athletes use more protein when they’re training in a carbohydrate-depleted state. In this case, we’re not talking about a consistently low-carb diet, but rather doing certain training sessions in a low-carb state to help the body adapt to burning fat more efficiently. There’s decent evidence that protein can help power these workouts, and Witard suggests taking in 10 to 20 grams of protein before and/or during this type of session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea of using protein to compensate for low carbs also connects to one of the most hotly debated ideas about protein for endurance athletes. There have been various research-backed claims over the years that adding protein to a sports drink that you consume during a race or training session will enhance your performance, and that taking in some protein in the immediate post-workout window will speed up the rate at which you refill the carbohydrate stores in your muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these claims, Witard and his colleagues argue, are the result of studies where the subjects didn’t get enough carbohydrates. If you’re &lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/carbs-maximize-endurance/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;meeting your carb needs&lt;/a&gt;, adding protein to a sports drink will neither boost your performance nor accelerate your muscle refueling. There may be exceptions for ultra-endurance events, which haven’t been well-studied and have somewhat different metabolic challenges compared to a marathon. But the researchers’ final conclusion is a reminder that for endurance athletes, despite protein’s current popularity, carbohydrate is still king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were also notified that HHS is not accepting content for those channels at this time,” the email added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to a request for comment regarding the changes to communication practices at the CDC, the director of communications at HHS, Andrew Nixon, cast doubt on what the workers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s unfortunate to see career officials spreading false rumors,” Nixon replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since HHS approval was instituted as a requirement for posting, almost no newsletters have been sent to the tens of thousands of people who subscribe to them, CDC workers said. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/about/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fhan%2Findex.html"&gt;last update&lt;/a&gt; sent out by the CDC’s Health Alert Network was regarding the risk of dengue infection on March 18, even though outbreaks of salmonella and listeria were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/outbreaks/index.html"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; in May by the CDC on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When CDC publications have gone out, some have been delayed or missing information. A recent release of CDC data regarding the prevalence of HIV in the U.S. cautioned that it “does not include data on PrEP coverage,” referring to medication taken by individuals to prevent HIV infection. “CDC is unable to resume PrEP coverage at this time, due to a reduction in force affecting the Division of HIV Prevention (DHP).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two CDC employees who work in communications told NPR that fewer than half of the public health posts they’ve sent to HHS for approval have been cleared for publication on social media. Even posts that include basic information about recent disease outbreaks, like the number of people sickened or hospitalized, have not been posted as requested by employees, NPR confirmed after reviewing posts submitted for approval by an employee. Communications workers say they are also suggesting fewer health posts because they anticipate that their posts will be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everything is getting bottlenecked at the top,” said a worker. “It is extraordinarily time-consuming and backlogs us by weeks, if not months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences could be deadly, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you have an outbreak of something like listeria, if you are a person who is pregnant and you consume food items that might have listeria in it that CDC should be warning you about, you run the risk of the baby that you are carrying dying,” said Guest. “And so that information needs to get out there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;‘Propaganda’ instead of public health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 1, thousands of federal health workers were laid off as part of the government’s “reduction in force.” Communication professionals at the CDC were not spared. Almost everyone at the CDC whose primary job was to communicate with the press was laid off, in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/03/g-s1-57888/hhs-fda-rfk-foia-public-records"&gt;almost everyone&lt;/a&gt; whose job it was to provide records to the public. Every member of the CDC’s division of digital media was also told their jobs would be eliminated, workers at the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All the points of contact that we generally rely on to communicate with the American people have either been eliminated or dramatically reduced,” said Griffis, the former CDC communications director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing all the CDC’s web developers, graphic designers and social media staffers simultaneously caused a problem. The CDC was suddenly locked out of its main social media accounts, said three people close to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The passwords to those accounts were kept on a password protected Word doc,” said one worker at the CDC. “And that Word doc was inaccessible for anyone left, because all of the people that could have opened that document were fired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the main accounts haven’t posted since the CDC’s digital media team was laid off. During March, the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/cdc/"&gt;main Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; posted more than 20 times — sometimes twice a day. The posts included information for pregnant women about how to take care of their developing babies and screenings for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only main CDC account that has posted some content since April 1 is the CDC’s account on X, a platform owned by Elon Musk. He oversaw the Department of Government Efficiency, the organization that spearheaded efforts to lay off tens of thousands of workers across federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 7, workers at the CDC said they were surprised to see the CDC’s main X account post a tweet for the first time in a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KQED</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 17:00:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOSmx2RDBXazV5U2FRQXM4U1JZbHZFNExqUTR6VUs1NXFScWYtTzZHQmRrX2l1SDFXYlVtQnBYZnNKbnZKaWlWbFprWllZR2hteFEyUkFYd01ka3VzMm50WWNkcEp2ZnlpbkJEcUxPRVBDY2h3OENILWZsY1RpbXhQVEpPenhlSmktVlIwNGVaTG15NFNvVW9JdFNQWE9WRFZyR0pxbm1sZE1jRkhFMTR5RHlB</guid></item><item><title>男子在罕见医疗案件中窒息打喷嚏和流泪-印度国防评论 | Man Stifles Sneeze and Tears Windpipe in Rare Medical Case - Indian Defence Review</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE5Hc1FrUFBZU3RtM01mUkNVMnJBZllqS1diSDhQUV9YU2hjcDE5Tkk4eHJoRTdFT1BLWFNlT0NZbG5sOFNBNFpXQkIzaDVHei10RklXWHBKZk40TkVhNlhQRGVCdlN5SHpJNll3YlVuc0FRcExhdGlSdGR0SQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man in his 30s from the United Kingdom experienced an unusual and medically rare complication after attempting to suppress a sneeze while behind the wheel.  Struggling with hay fever symptoms, he pinched his nose and closed his mouth to contain the reflex, an action that appeared harmless but resulted in a serious internal injury. According to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/diagnostic-dilemma-a-man-held-in-a-sneeze-and-it-punctured-his-windpipe" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.livescience.com/health/diagnostic-dilemma-a-man-held-in-a-sneeze-and-it-punctured-his-windpipe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Live Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, this maneuver led to a spontaneous rupture of his &lt;em&gt;windpipe&lt;/em&gt;, an outcome rarely observed without external trauma. The event initiated a cascade of clinical investigations and raised concerns among doctors about the hidden dangers of interfering with such a natural reflex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patient arrived at the emergency department with &lt;em&gt;severe neck pain&lt;/em&gt;, a visibly &lt;em&gt;swollen neck&lt;/em&gt;, and he reported he could &lt;em&gt;barely move his neck&lt;/em&gt; due to discomfort. Despite these symptoms, he was able to &lt;em&gt;breathe, swallow, and speak normally&lt;/em&gt;. Upon physical examination, physicians noted a &lt;em&gt;faint crackling sound&lt;/em&gt;—a clinical sign indicating that &lt;em&gt;air had escaped into soft tissues&lt;/em&gt;. Initial &lt;em&gt;X-rays&lt;/em&gt; revealed &lt;em&gt;surgical emphysema&lt;/em&gt;, a condition where air is trapped under the skin’s deepest tissue layers.  A follow-up &lt;em&gt;CT scan&lt;/em&gt; showed a &lt;em&gt;small perforation (2 mm by 2 mm, or 0.08 x 0.08 inches)&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;trachea&lt;/em&gt;, specifically between the &lt;em&gt;third and fourth cervical vertebrae (C3–C4)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tear allowed air to escape from the trachea into the surrounding tissues and into the mediastinum. According to the physicians’ report, the rupture was caused by a “rapid build-up of pressure in the &lt;em&gt;trachea&lt;/em&gt; while sneezing with a pinched nose and closed mouth.” This intense pressure likely caused a tear in the &lt;em&gt;windpipe&lt;/em&gt;, allowing air to escape into surrounding tissues. Estimates suggest this action can create pressures more than 20 times higher than those generated during a typical “achoo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Hospital Treatment and Follow-Up&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors opted against surgery, instead placing the patient under close observation for &lt;em&gt;two days&lt;/em&gt;. During this period, he was &lt;em&gt;not permitted to eat or drink&lt;/em&gt; for the first 24 hours and was monitored for vital signs and oxygen saturation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was later discharged with &lt;em&gt;pain relief&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;hay fever medications&lt;/em&gt;, and advised to &lt;em&gt;avoid strenuous physical activity for two weeks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;five-week follow-up CT scan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; confirmed that the tear had &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;completely healed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Sneeze That Led to an Unexpected Medical Emergency&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous tracheal tears are &lt;em&gt;rarely reported in &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/after-a-knee-surgery-this-teenager-wakes-up-speaking-a-foreign-language-and-has-forgotten-his-mother-tongue/" data-type="post" data-id="77052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;medical literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Previous documented cases were typically linked to &lt;em&gt;external trauma&lt;/em&gt;, or occurred as &lt;em&gt;complications from medical interventions&lt;/em&gt; such as &lt;em&gt;thyroidectomy&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;intubation&lt;/em&gt;.  To the authors’ knowledge, no prior cases have involved tracheal rupture solely due to stifling a sneeze. In their report, the doctors issued a direct warning, stating: “&lt;em&gt;Everyone should be advised not to stifle sneezes by pinching the nose while keeping the mouth closed as it can result in tracheal perforation.&lt;/em&gt;” This case illustrates how everyday actions, when done improperly, can lead to unexpected and medically significant consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

Then it slows down how fast your stomach empties food, which keeps you feeling full for longer after a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"This causes you to lose weight as you eat less. But it can make some people feel sick and even give them diarrhoea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;LADbible Group has contacted Novo Nordisk, Ozempic's manufacturer, for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 16:37:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNb082NFcyUy15eUZnbERxYXBwMTY1SVBwWWQzRVAwTmtDSGFCSHpodUdFNnB5SzZ0NjM4dlA1bXBIeDh3bTlGWTQtWDZ6RHVuQllRb3dxc0ZLREpHazVvS3BUekRYLTdnSTJmWTNoN1RTQ01WeEJNNXZZbGVJX2xZNWZGdFc1Y0ZHdzgyZ25jckY1dDd1UnVfWWZScHRrNDR1UzllMGdzWUdwZzFBeENJ</guid></item><item><title>早餐吃少量蔓越莓的10个理由-印度时报 | 10 reasons to consume a handful of cranberries for breakfast - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi8AFBVV95cUxPbDlsSXFXR1JBR1VZOVFKWkdnSHpFMHJzWFFOeWt1WWpzRWNlaTd5LTZxV0pqNGxhekFBVUVfdUtyLXpicDhjUlVGU2hxNVlYQUJoU0FTYlN4cEh5bkJlOHZzSkdUWm1oZVM2VDdVTXpvUEtHNTZFd3JONUJjV04xLTIxVXNYNDVMZVlEeWhDSmU1elY4em5kcDlfV0FHNDlvckNFQzMxTTd6Qy1YOHFZX0tJeUZmbGpoYWpKQ0lQMDJJOFpHUGZfZ1hKbmpmUTZPRmt5MVR4U3k5d29uX1laZW9KcXVUUTFiNVVHaTIzX0_SAfABQVVfeXFMT2w5bElxV0dSQUdVWTlRSlpHZ0h6RTByc1hRTnlrdVlqc0VjZWk3eS02cVdKajRsYXpBQVVFX3VLci16YnA4Y1JVRlNocTVZWEFCaFNBU2JTeHBIeW5CZTh2c0pHVFptaGVTNlQ3VU16b1BLRzU2RXdyTjVCY1dOMS0yMVVzWDQ1TGVZRHloQ0plNXpWOHpuZHA5X1dBRzQ5b3JDRUMzMU03ekMtWDhxWV9LSXlGZmxqaGFqSkNJUDAySThaR1BmX2dYSm5qZlE2T0ZreTFUeFN5OXdvbl9ZWmVvSnF1VFExYjVVR2kyM19P?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;amp-story-grid-layer class="recircular" id="rcontent" template="vertical"&gt;&lt;div class="letterbox"&gt;&lt;p class="mid-heading"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You may also like&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc3 pa"&gt;10 reasons to start consuming fish oil n...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc5 pa"&gt;10 yogic exercises that work wonders for...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/amp-story-grid-layer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8AFBVV95cUxPbDlsSXFXR1JBR1VZOVFKWkdnSHpFMHJzWFFOeWt1WWpzRWNlaTd5LTZxV0pqNGxhekFBVUVfdUtyLXpicDhjUlVGU2hxNVlYQUJoU0FTYlN4cEh5bkJlOHZzSkdUWm1oZVM2VDdVTXpvUEtHNTZFd3JONUJjV04xLTIxVXNYNDVMZVlEeWhDSmU1elY4em5kcDlfV0FHNDlvckNFQzMxTTd6Qy1YOHFZX0tJeUZmbGpoYWpKQ0lQMDJJOFpHUGZfZ1hKbmpmUTZPRmt5MVR4U3k5d29uX1laZW9KcXVUUTFiNVVHaTIzX0_SAfABQVVfeXFMT2w5bElxV0dSQUdVWTlRSlpHZ0h6RTByc1hRTnlrdVlqc0VjZWk3eS02cVdKajRsYXpBQVVFX3VLci16YnA4Y1JVRlNocTVZWEFCaFNBU2JTeHBIeW5CZTh2c0pHVFptaGVTNlQ3VU16b1BLRzU2RXdyTjVCY1dOMS0yMVVzWDQ1TGVZRHloQ0plNXpWOHpuZHA5X1dBRzQ5b3JDRUMzMU03ekMtWDhxWV9LSXlGZmxqaGFqSkNJUDAySThaR1BmX2dYSm5qZlE2T0ZreTFUeFN5OXdvbl9ZWmVvSnF1VFExYjVVR2kyM19P</guid></item><item><title>我应该在多大程度上担心我的硬皮棕色皮肤贴片？ -《每日邮报》 | How concerned should I be about my crusty brown skin patches? - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQdGM2eUJMX3FSVlNpVVlvdElVYklIVjdzSjJyejBOcWJXNEdiOEdvNTJmNk5wUnNtaFYzY1dfaUJaR0U4TE8xTzFteHJUUnZiaHZmYVlvOGxXZU56dURxS1owTzJZUWdlSm1WM1dnU3Z6ZlNNeERWckswenh0enRMZ0JRSGt6dUV4MDByT0dtSU5YQm1hWlRka3pVZHEyTXYtN1Y3RU1jRDZJMjd3M2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic"&gt;I am 77 and have crusty patches on my breasts, back and stomach. Could they be cancerous?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie Cannon replies: &lt;/span&gt;It is unlikely. These sound like seborrhoeic keratoses – harmless skin growths that affect around three-quarters of people over 70 and often appear as rough, crusty patches in shades of tan, brown or black that can grow several centimetres wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although sometimes called seborrhoeic warts, they’re not caused by a virus as actual warts are. They’re clusters of skin cells and, while the cause is not fully understood, they don’t turn cancerous – although patients may be bothered by how they look. But if one suddenly changes its size, shape or colour – particularly if it’s very dark – it’s worth getting checked by your doctor or a dermatologist to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common treatment is freezing – also known as cryotherapy – which involves applying liquid nitrogen to the lesion to destroy the build-up of skin cells. This typically causes the area to blister, scab and fall away within a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Because these patches are benign and don’t become cancerous, removal is usually considered cosmetic and not funded by the NHS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Or it can be removed by curettage, where the mark is scraped away using a small tool called a curette. This is done under local anaesthetic and may be combined with cauterisation – a technique using heat to seal the area and minimise regrowth risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another common treatment is electrosurgery, where a targeted electrical current burns away the lesion, often followed by scraping to remove any remaining tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laser therapy – vaporising the keratosis with a focused beam of light – is another possible approach, but tends to be more expensive and less available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because these patches are benign and don’t become cancerous, removal is usually considered cosmetic and not funded by the NHS. And even if removed privately, they may regrow or return elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic"&gt;For the past two years I’ve had pins and needles and numbness in both legs. Specialists can’t tell me why – what should I do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie Cannon replies: &lt;/span&gt;Pins and needles and numbness in the legs are a common but distressing problem, and usually a sign of a nerve-related issue, especially if in both legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nerves carry electrical signals that help us sense touch, pressure and pain. When they aren’t working properly – usually due to damage or underlying conditions – these signals can misfire, causing sensations such as tingling or numbness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The root issue is often in the spine, where the nerves for the legs begin. A slipped disc or spinal arthritis can compress them, leading to the sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another possible cause is peripheral neuropathy – damage to the nerves at the ends of the limbs, typically the feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It becomes more common with age and can be linked to diabetes, a vitamin B12 deficiency or major treatments such as chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A medication designed to treat nerve-related pain and tingling called pregabalin may help. But your GP can arrange more tests to find the problem. An X-ray of the lower spine may reveal nerve compression, and nerve conduction studies can help identify where the issue lies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vascular trouble – problems with the veins or arteries – can cause leg pain, but they don’t typically lead to pins and needles or numbness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic"&gt;My ten-year-old grandson has been having bouts of sickness and gagging in the morning – sometimes he can’t even eat his breakfast. It often happens before football matches or on school days, then fades after ten to 15 minutes. What could be causing this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie Cannon replies: &lt;/span&gt;Nausea in children can be due to a range of things, but the reassuring detail in this case is that symptoms settle quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If there was a physical cause behind it, then it would usually occur at different times of the day and might also be triggered by eating or lying down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fact that it only happens in the morning suggests emotional upset or mild stress. Morning nausea and issues swallowing are often linked to anxiety – in both adults and children – often triggered by anticipation of the day ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s important to rule out any physical cause, so a visit to the doctor is a sensible next step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If your grandson is growing well, eating normally the rest of the time, sleeping soundly and staying active, those are all positive signs – but the GP may want to run some basic tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Occasionally a lingering stomach infection, such as Helicobacter pylori, can cause nausea and stomach discomfort, especially before eating, but&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;it can be checked with a simple stool test. Constipation is another common, and often overlooked, cause of nausea in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since breakfast is important before school or physical activity, it may help to shift the morning routine – waking up earlier to allow more time before eating. It can also be useful to talk with your grandson about how physical symptoms (‘butterflies’ or a tight stomach) can happen when we feel anxious. This may spark a conversation and give him the language to express what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 15:52:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxQdGM2eUJMX3FSVlNpVVlvdElVYklIVjdzSjJyejBOcWJXNEdiOEdvNTJmNk5wUnNtaFYzY1dfaUJaR0U4TE8xTzFteHJUUnZiaHZmYVlvOGxXZU56dURxS1owTzJZUWdlSm1WM1dnU3Z6ZlNNeERWckswenh0enRMZ0JRSGt6dUV4MDByT0dtSU5YQm1hWlRka3pVZHEyTXYtN1Y3RU1jRDZJMjd3M2c</guid></item><item><title>巧克力+茶=更好的血压？科学家揭示令人惊讶的结果- SciTechDaily | Chocolate + Tea = Better Blood Pressure?

When he emerged in a disoriented fog, he realized that his perception of time had unraveled way more than he had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The curious results from his subterranean stay turned into a whole new chapter in the study of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/chronobiology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronobiology&lt;/a&gt;, which examines how living creatures keep time within their bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michel found himself at the center of a movement that would later connect to everything from jet lag to space travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-surprising-pursuit"&gt;A surprising pursuit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1963, Siffre planned to stay underground for 15 days to study a glacier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He soon realized that this time would not be enough, so he decided to push past normal limits and live beneath the surface for more than two months, relying on basic supplies and no timekeeping devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to understand, I was a geologist by training,” said Siffre. He stripped away external markers of day and night, and was content to note his daily activities while losing track of how the outside world ticked along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unlocking-an-internal-clock"&gt;Unlocking an internal clock&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;His most astonishing takeaway was that people have a personal timer that keeps ticking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separated from sunrise, standard schedules, and everyday routines, he uncovered an internal clock that slowly drifted beyond the standard 24-hour day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without knowing it, I […] created the field of human chronobiology,” explained Siffre. Free from external prompts, his &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519507/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt; slid into a longer pattern, suggesting that our bodies don’t always stick to the planet’s day-night spin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-body-s-clock-works-differently-in-isolation"&gt;The body’s clock works differently in isolation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/people-are-falling-in-love-with-ai-companions-and-it-could-be-dangerous/"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; who followed Siffre’s method – and sometimes worked alongside him – saw similar results. Their sleep-wake cycles bent and stretched, sometimes reaching absurd lengths, including instances of 33 hours of sleep and 72 hours of wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One subject even wore a microphone, prompting panic when he didn’t stir for more than a day. Researchers initially feared he had died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These unpredictable shifts proved that the body’s timing system operates independently and erratically when left to its own devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-unexpected-interest-in-internal-clock-findings"&gt;Unexpected interest in internal clock findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cold War era was in full swing, and NASA wanted to understand how astronauts might cope with time shifts away from Earth’s regular day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Military programs also became curious about best practices for submariners, who spent lengthy intervals away from natural light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research teams observed that these extended hours of wakefulness and rest could pose unique challenges, and support arrived swiftly to probe deeper into what happens when people are removed from typical time cues. &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/explorer/Investigation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;’s backing highlighted the immediate value of Siffre’s discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-relevance-in-modern-science"&gt;Relevance in modern science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, scientists continue exploring how disrupted sleep patterns can throw off hormone levels, mood, and even immune function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shift workers benefit from an understanding of these natural cycles, and knowledge gleaned from cave experiments helps guide strategies to minimize fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts also link out-of-sync body clocks with heightened health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2017/press-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; recognized further breakthroughs on the genetics behind internal clocks, also known as circadian cycles. This gave a nod to the foundations laid by bold adventurers like Siffre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-criticism-and-caution"&gt;Criticism and caution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From day one, his work stirred a lot of chatter. Some observers argued that his approach seemed reckless or theatrical, while others worried that placing people in such extreme isolation might bring undue stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions were also raised about the potential effect of human presence on delicate underground life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the push to clarify how biology maintains &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/physicists-confirm-the-incredible-existence-of-time-mirrors/"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; overshadowed those doubts, and Siffre’s name became associated with gritty persistence and unexpected scientific impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-siffre-s-legacy-of-timing"&gt;Siffre’s legacy of timing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;His method won supporters who saw its practical side. There was particular excitement over data on how the body adapts when divorced from external time prompts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This offered a window into biological machinery that touches nearly every corner of health and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He showed that patterns of rest and activity can stray far from the familiar 24-hour day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, he demonstrated how resilient people can be when conventional signals are stripped away, sparking conversations among physiologists, psychologists, and government agencies alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reflections-on-exploration"&gt;Reflections on exploration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siffre’s work revealed that stepping away from clocks goes beyond missing a few appointments.

    &lt;p&gt;British company Oxford Brain Diagnostics has now been certified to start offering the method and is in talks with private health providers about rollout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has already been designated by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States as a “breakthrough” device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neuroscientist behind the advances said it meant medical professionals were able to see changes in the brain far earlier, at level normally only be possible via a post-mortem examination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, two major treatments for Alzheimer’s disease have been given the green light by UK regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/dementia/alzheimers-drug-donanemab-changed-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Donanemab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/08/21/alzheimers-wonder-drug-lecanemab-approved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;lecanemab&lt;/a&gt; are the first treatments found to slow progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, both have been &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/10/20/nhs-patients-to-miss-out-on-benefits-of-new-alzheimers-drug/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;blocked for use on the NHS&lt;/a&gt; on the grounds they are not cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts believe that &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/memory-in-midlife/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;diagnosing dementia early&lt;/a&gt; is key to making &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/dementia/midlife-medications-dementia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;treatments more effective&lt;/a&gt; and helping to ensure they become more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost 1 million people in the UK are are &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/dementia/risk-factors-for-dementia-you-can-do-something-about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;living with dementia&lt;/a&gt;, but this number is expected to reach 1.4 million by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxford Brain Diagnostics, a spinout company from the University of Oxford, was founded by Dr Steven Chance, former associate professor of neuroscience at Oxford, and Prof Mark Jenkinson, a leading expert in brain imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough was achieved after the company received funding from UK investment firm BGF and the Oxford Technology &amp;amp; Innovations Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Identify other neurodegenerative conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have found the method can detect neurodegenerative changes before any &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/mind-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;visible brain shrinkage&lt;/a&gt; or atrophy appears on standard imaging as well as distinguish between &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/dementia/main-types-of-dementia-how-scientists-treat-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;different types of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also been found to predict which individuals with mild cognitive impairment are more likely to develop dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform could also help to identify other neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Chance said: “The core technology is founded on my background, looking at the microscopic structure of brains at autopsy for many years. You couldn’t do that with a living patient and this is what we needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the technology could have a “transformative” impact, bringing hope to “millions of people who are seeking a non-invasive, precision diagnostic tool to reveal the truth about their brain health”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the target patient market is those suffering mild cognitive decline, allowing professionals to differentiate between types of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/2025/01/09/the-13-dementia-risk-factors-and-what-to-do-about-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Chance said clinics might offer annual MOTs for those with concerns about memory problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In time, and with the advent of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/dementia/lecanemab-alzheimers-drug-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;more medicines to treat dementia&lt;/a&gt;, such advances could be rolled out to those in mid-life, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More than 20 per cent of those over 50 have Alzheimer’s-type changes, small-scale changes that would be otherwise invisible. These breakthroughs open up a whole new way of monitoring brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Thomas, head of policy at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “Dementia is caused by diseases that often begin years before symptoms appear, and so finding new ways to detect these diseases earlier is vital. There is a huge amount of progress happening in this space and it’s encouraging to see UK companies contributing to that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this technology shows promise for diagnosing dementia earlier, so far it has only been validated in research settings. We’re still some way off it being used within the NHS and we would need to see much more real-world clinical data to fully understand its potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Improving early and accurate diagnosis is crucial – not only to give people clarity about their condition but also to ensure they can access the right support and, in future, new treatments as they become available.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A nourishing breakfast is a great way to set the tone for your day. And one of our faves is this five-star &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/roasted-vegetable-breakfast-grain-bowl-8742347" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;High-Protein Anti-Inflammatory Breakfast Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to packing 21 grams of protein for energy and satiety, this colorful recipe is loaded with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292071/the-best-foods-to-eat-to-fight-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;anti-inflammatory nutrients&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why does inflammation matter? In the short term, inflammation is a normal response to harmful things like infections or injuries, as it’s your body's natural way of healing itself. However, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7908104/understanding-acute-vs-chronic-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chronic, long-term inflammation&lt;/a&gt; can cause harm over time, potentially leading to cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, joint issues and more.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This bowl is packed with a winning combo of protein plus inflammation-fighting nutrients to keep you strong, healthy and energized for the short and long term.  So, whip one up and get ready to seize the day!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-we-love-this-anti-inflammatory-breakfast-bowl"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why We Love This Anti-Inflammatory Breakfast Bowl &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This plant-forward breakfast bowl features a blend of roasted acorn squash and broccoli, black beans, beets, fluffy quinoa and a perfectly cooked egg. To round things all out, it’s drizzled with a creamy tahini sauce. Here are a few more reasons we’re such big fans.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting enough protein helps stabilize your blood sugar and keeps mid-morning hunger at bay. Each serving of this recipe provides 21 grams of protein, thanks to the egg, black beans and quinoa. Both the eggs and quinoa offer &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;complete protein&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they contain all nine essential amino acids your body needs.  “High quality sources of protein provide essential amino acids, like leucine, isoleucine and valine, needed to build and repair tissues, regulate immune responses and produce anti-inflammatory compounds in the body,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirbie-daily/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Kirbie Daily, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the protein in black beans is incomplete, don’t underestimate them. These healthy legumes provide &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant protein&lt;/a&gt;, shown to provide a long list of health benefits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Rich in Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows fiber plays a key role in reducing inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It also keeps you full and satisfied and can help kick-start your digestive system to get things going in the morning. Yet, few of us get the recommended 25 to 38 grams we need per day. And talk about a recipe that’s jam-packed with it! Each of these breakfast bowls touts an impressive 16 grams worth. Ingredients like acorn squash, broccoli, beans and quinoa contribute a mix of both &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble and insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; for multiple health benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Packed with Anti-Inflammatory Veggies &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This recipe delivers a hefty dose of colorful vegetables that are rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047144/best-anti-inflammatory-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation-fighting nutrients&lt;/a&gt; and plant compounds. Let’s start with acorn squash. It’s filled with vitamin A and vitamin C, two antioxidants that help combat oxidative stress and support the immune system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Then there are beets. Their vibrant, dark hue comes from plant pigments called betalains that act as antioxidants to protect cells from damage. “Not only are beets a fantastic source of antioxidants like vitamins C and A, but they are also rich in dietary nitrates,” says Daily. “Our body naturally converts dietary nitrates to nitric oxide, a molecule that improves blood flow and helps lower inflammation.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And let’s not forget broccoli. This anti-inflammatory powerhouse is rich in sulforaphane, a plant chemical that may tame inflammation by encouraging the growth of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/#:~:text=Probiotics%20are%20the%20beneficial%20bacteria,good%20bacteria%20to%20your%20gut." class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;good gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Make-Ahead Friendly &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This breakfast bowl is super meal-prep friendly. You can roast the vegetables and cook the quinoa in advance, then quickly reheat and top with a freshly fried or poached egg in the morning. To save even more time, you can also batch-cook the eggs and tahini up to two days in advance. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Feel free to switch things up, too! You can swap the quinoa for farro or brown rice, add avocado for even more healthy fats, or top it with a dollop of plain Greek yogurt instead of the tahini sauce for extra protein. If you prefer a vegan version, simply replace the egg with a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/tofu-scramble-8559643" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tofu scramble.&lt;/a&gt;
