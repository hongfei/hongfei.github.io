&lt;p&gt;Heard the one about Ozempic? Haven’t we all — if only millions of Americans who could benefit from this and other trendy weight-loss drugs &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/28/health/ozempic-which-costs-up-to-1300-can-be-made-for-5-study/"&gt;could get them covered through their insurance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But you don’t have to sign up for the pricey jabs to shed the pounds, some experts say — there’s a way to beat the odds in &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/health/ultra-processed-foods-drive-colorectal-cancer-risk-prevent-healing-study/"&gt;a food culture that seems rigged against those struggling&lt;/a&gt; to control their eating. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a processed food, treat yo’ self world, nutrition expert Mark Hewett of &lt;a href="https://gainsnutrition.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Gains Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; says that there’s an easy way to take back control — and it’s not counting calories, or running your tail off at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ginger’s low glycemic index is just one of its many benefits, an expert explained. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Luis Echeverri Urrea – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding what drives hunger, according to Hewett, is the key to making better choices. In focusing purely on willpower, people overlook important contributors such as the glycemic index, or GI, of foods. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This number, which you can easily look up for any food your thinking of eating, tells you how it will impact your blood sugar — and how quickly your cravings will return after you eat.&lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing foods with low-GI, Hewett said, could in fact be the quickest and easiest way to naturally learn appetite control&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Most people focus on calories, but research shows that the way foods impact blood sugar can be just as important in managing hunger,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Low-GI foods (with a glycemic index of 55 or less) are digested and absorbed more slowly, leading to gradual blood sugar changes instead of sharp spikes and crashes. This helps regulate appetite, keeping you full longer and reducing cravings naturally.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ready to put the science to the test? Here are six low-GI foods to work into your diet — see how they work for you. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avocados&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Africa Studio – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of just 5, avocados digest incredibly slowly, providing steady energy without triggering the blood sugar spikes that often lead to cravings,” Hewett explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Their combination of fiber and healthy fats keeps appetite hormones in check, making them one of the most effective foods for natural appetite control.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asparagus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;nata_vkusidey – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of 15, asparagus is an excellent choice for appetite control. Its high fiber content slows digestion while adding volume to meals, helping you feel full without excessive calories. Asparagus also supports gut health, which plays a crucial role in hunger regulation,” Hewett said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almonds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;kuvona – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of 15, almonds offer a powerful blend of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. Unlike high-carb snacks that cause sugar spikes and crashes, almonds digest slowly, providing steady energy and preventing sudden cravings. Their nutrient profile also helps regulate appetite hormones like ghrelin and leptin, which control hunger and satiety.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Olives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Igor Dutina – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of 15, black olives provide a unique mix of monounsaturated fats and polyphenols that support appetite regulation. These healthy fats slow digestion, keeping you full longer. The polyphenols in olives have also been linked to reduced inflammation, which prevents erratic hunger signals.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chili&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kristen – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of 15, chili peppers contain capsaicin. Capsaicin has been shown to mildly boost metabolism while suppressing appetite, making it a powerful tool for natural weight management. Consuming spicy foods can lead to a lower calorie intake throughout the day without conscious effort.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ginger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Atlas – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With a glycemic index of 15, ginger is well-known for its digestion-enhancing and appetite-regulating properties. It helps control hunger by increasing thermogenesis (calorie burning) and improving insulin sensitivity, preventing post-meal crashes that trigger cravings,” Hewett said.” &lt;/p&gt;

Older folks tend to be the most at risk, with about 700 people 65 and older dying so far this year from the common virus. But at least 15 children have also succumbed to the flu, including &lt;a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/fourth-san-diego-county-teen-dies-from-flu/3755554/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;four teenagers in San Diego County&lt;/a&gt;, raising concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When compared to the data reported over the course of previous flu seasons, the toll this year has already exploded past the totals from the last several flu seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point of the season, Week 7, there were about 500 deaths last season, and 600 the year before, but in both of those seasons the deaths had already started to plateau by mid-February. This year, the number of deaths has yet to show signs of slowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a surprise” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco professor of medicine who specializes in infectious diseases. He said it was projected to be an average season, but it is turning out to be anything but. And with test positivity rates still high, there are at least a few weeks left of the virus’s sending people to the hospital before it retreats for its annual hibernation, which usually begins as spring turns to summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is surprising, first of all that we didn’t see much COVID, and secondly that we saw a lot of flu,” Chin-Hong said. “And not just flu — bad flu which is making people seriously ill.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it is important for people to know that despite its being late in the typical virus season, it is not too late to get vaccinated against influenza, whether they have had one strain already or not. Chin-Hong also wants to remind people of the antivirals available to combat the worst outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tamiflu, an antiviral used to treat the flu, can also be used prophylactically to prevent the spread of the virus within a household, and Chin-Hong would recommend those who are living with elderly or at-risk family members to ask their doctor about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The last really bad flu season was in 2009, for swine flu,” Chin-Hong said, “since then it has kind of been regular flu seasons, until this year.”&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak in rural West Texas has grown to 90 cases across seven counties, the state health department posted online Friday, and 16 people are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In neighboring eastern New Mexico, the measles case count is up to nine, though state public health officials said Thursday there’s still no evidence this outbreak is connected to the one in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease. Here’s what you should know about how to protect yourself against measles, as well as what’s happening in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Where are measles spreading?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West Texas cases are concentrated in Gaines County, which has 57 infections, and Terry County, north of Gaines, where there are now 20 confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawson County, to the east of Gaines, was new to the count with six. Yoakum County has four and Lubbock, Lynn and Ector counties have a case each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/measles-outbreak-raises-concerns-about-drop-in-vaccinations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; Measles outbreak raises concerns about drop in vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas state health department data shows the vast majority of cases are among people younger than 18: 26 in kids younger than 4 and 51 in kids 5-17 years old. Ten adults have measles and three cases are “pending” an age determination. The Ector County Health Department told the &lt;a href="https://www.oaoa.com/local-news/ector-county-health-department-confirms-positive-case-of-measles-in-ector-county-resident/"&gt;Odessa American&lt;/a&gt; its case was in a child too young to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health officials have said this outbreak is Texas’ largest in nearly 30 years. Health department spokeswoman Lara Anton said last week that cases have been concentrated in a “close-knit, undervaccinated” Mennonite community — especially among families who attend small private religious schools or are homeschooled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New Mexico, all of the cases are in Lea County, which borders Gaines County in Texas. The state health department has said people may have been exposed at a grocery store, an elementary school, a church, Nor-Lea Hospital and a Walgreens in Hobbs, New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;What is measles?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/index.html#:~:text=Measles%20is%20one%20of%20the,breathes%2C%20coughs%2C%20or%20sneezes."&gt;according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from the measles if they get it, but infection can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Is the vaccine safe?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt; (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective in preventing measles infection and severe cases of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/measles-cases-are-rising-in-the-u-s-heres-why-misinformation-about-the-vaccine-persists-today"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Measles cases are rising in the U.S. Here’s why misinformation about the vaccine persists today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it’s usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no link between the vaccine and autism, despite a now-discredited study and health disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Why do vaccination rates matter?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95 percent — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. Five years earlier, measles cases were the worst in almost three decades in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14 percent of K-12 children in the 2023-24 school year. Health officials say that number is likely higher because it doesn’t include many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;What are public health officials doing to stop the spread?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health workers are hosting regular vaccination clinic and screening efforts in Texas, as well as working with schools to educate people about the importance of vaccination and offering shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Mexico health officials are also hosting several vaccination clinics in Hobbs next week.&lt;/p&gt;

At least 77 of them were reported in children and teens under 17. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In New Mexico, officials said nine people had been sickened in Lea County, along the state's eastern border with Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Measles is highly contagious and can be deadly. The outbreaks come amid a rise in US anti-vaccine sentiment, including towards the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab that is typically received during childhood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Health officials in Texas say those numbers are likely an undercount, as some parents may not report infections or may not realise their child has the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It is troubling, because this was completely preventable," Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University, told CBS News, the BBC's American news partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It's the most contagious infectious disease known to humans," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Symptoms of the highly infectious illness include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation and a signature rash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;A measles infection can have particularly devastating complications for pregnant women and young children, including pneumonia, neurological impairment, hearing loss and death, and survivors are at risk of developing a degenerative brain and nervous system disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Most US children receive two shots to protect against the illness, which together are 97% effective in protecting against measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Health experts say that the disease could be controlled or even eradicated with proper inoculation rates - generally defined as 95% of a community receiving the measles vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But vaccination rates have dropped in some communities in recent decades as a loose network of vaccine sceptics have without evidence questioned the safety and efficacy of the shots. Robert F Kennedy Jr, recently confirmed as President Donald Trump's health secretary, faced strong criticism for his ties to these groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Most states require that children receive the MMR vaccine to attend school, but many, including Texas, also allow families to file a conscientious exemption - a non-medical reason to refuse a vaccine requirement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In Texas, federal data shows that the state achieved a 94.3% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2023-2024 school year, while New Mexico reached 95%. But a state survey of Texas schools found that rates of exemptions were ticking upwards for MMR and other required vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In Gaines County, where 57 of the Texas cases were reported, exemptions have surged over the last decade. State data shows 17.62% of students had a conscientious exemption to at least one required vaccine during the 2023-2024 school year, up from 7.45% in the 2013-2014 year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Neighbouring Terry County, home to 20 cases, saw exemption rates go from zero to 3.73% in the same time period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Texas officials reported that of the 90 cases in their state, 85 were in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;CBS reports that the area is home to a large Mennonite community, which typically have low vaccination rates due to the group's religious beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But some officials are reluctant to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"We respect everyone's right to vaccinate or not get vaccinated," Albert Pilkington, CEO of the nearby Seminole Hospital District, told the Texas Standard. "That's just what it means to be an American, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;American children have been vaccinated against measles since 1963. The jab was improved and combined with vaccines for the mumps and rubella viruses about a decade later, and is widely considered to be safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Prior to the vaccine's introduction, around 48,000 people were hospitalized with measles each year and 400–500 people died. In 2024, the US reported 285 cases with 114 hospitalisations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Health officials in New Mexico are offering a free vaccine clinic this week in an effort to boost protection. Texas also directed residents to contact their doctors or visit a clinic to get vaccinated if they have not previously received a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 23:24:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBlN1NJWmlQenVYSTlTdERoeVhaWjVmR0twTFc0Q2dkdTRibXZXbmtRS0tUWm1CTmhrV1lWbGhEUXBQTjhQdkowZzEzOFFIS1pMTzRuTWdOLU5SZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE1temxEeDVIUktMb3dael9EVFU2am9OZ3ZieFJjd2pzc0lULWNiQ1d0d043OTNVblNFa0ZkSmNXOG03dlpYNE51bzFFVTZtZUljbDhIME9CRjAtOWpwRDRB</guid></item><item><title>Optimism and Pessimism Shape Resilience and Risk - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE1MUU1BN0lXck0tUVNjd2d3bzZBT0dHNWV6UTdWUmZEYldQRktWT0RBNVFudDJmcUhsRUwxcXJMdWFEZ0hRMmxjVHBfb0VzU0VWbFVnZ0xKV0lmWVoya0x4MHdxaXN4MERNOWRaOGdFUUNyNHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers examined how optimism and pessimism influenced well-being and behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyzing data from a large-scale study of older adults, they found that optimism was linked to lower stress and greater resilience, while lower pessimism was associated with safer health behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimistic individuals worried less, felt less lonely, and exercised more, contributing to better mental health. However, when it came to behaviors that reduced COVID-19 risk, lower pessimism—not higher optimism—was the key factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with a less pessimistic outlook were more likely to stay home and avoid risky activities. The findings suggest that fostering optimism and reducing pessimism could help people better cope with prolonged stressors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimism and Well-Being:&lt;/strong&gt; Optimistic individuals had lower stress, greater resilience, and engaged in more physical activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pessimism and Risk Avoidance:&lt;/strong&gt; People with lower pessimism were more likely to avoid risky behaviors like traveling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coping Strategies Matter:&lt;/strong&gt; Behavioral adaptations, such as exercising at home or using virtual social interactions, contributed to well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Syracuse University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you see the glass as half empty or half full? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you rewind to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, chances are you experienced some level of pessimism. And who could blame you? With social isolation, health concerns and economic uncertainty, fear and anxiety became a daily reality for many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers from Syracuse University and Michigan State University recently explored the personal characteristics that help people handle prolonged stressors, such as the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Jeewon Oh, assistant professor of psychology in Syracuse University’s College of Arts and Sciences, the group delved into optimism and pessimism and how those mindsets influence well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group utilized data from the Health and Retirement Study, a large-scale panel study that gathers a nationally representative sample of Americans aged 50 and older (Sonnega et al., 2014).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, participants responded to questions assessing their levels of optimism, such as “In uncertain times, I usually expect the best,” and pessimism, such as “I hardly ever expect things to go my way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic (between March and May 2020), respondents answered questions on health-related behaviors that either increased or reduced the risk of COVID transmission, including masking frequency, travel habits and the likelihood of staying home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used this data to explore how people’s mindsets affected their psychological and physical well-being during challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among their findings, they found that greater optimism promotes resilience and well-being when faced with stressors like the pandemic, while lower pessimism is linked to safer health behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings appeared in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Personality&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following Q&amp;amp;A, Professor Jeewon Oh shares some key insights from their research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the motivation for this study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeewon Oh (JO): The pandemic introduced many changes, and we wanted to know more about personality traits that can help people cope with enduring and uncontrollable stressors like the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined optimism, because it motivates action. Since optimists view stressful situations positively, they are more likely to directly address the issue or try to adapt when things are uncontrollable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were the benefits for those who were more optimistic? How did optimism/pessimism correlate with well-being during the pandemic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(JO): Both optimism and pessimism had independent associations with psychological well-being. So, people who are more optimistic and less pessimistic worried less, were less stressed and lonely and were more resilient. This was partly because these people engaged in more physical activity and perceived more social support and less strain from their relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when it came to COVID/health-relevant behaviors, pessimism played a significant role, but optimism didn’t. In other words, individuals with a less pessimistic mindset (but not a more optimistic mindset), who have weaker negative expectations tended to engage in less risky behaviors, such as traveling, and more activities at home ranging from watching TV and gardening to meditating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does optimism or pessimism influence the way people approach challenges and setbacks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(JO): In general, regular optimism/pessimism isn’t about thinking they wouldn’t get sick, or they will be more likely to get sick (compared to others), but about knowing the reality and still thinking that things will eventually work out. This positive mindset helps people to problem-solve and cope. Afterall, if you think things would never work out, why would you even try?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a way to boost one’s optimism during times when they may be more anxious, like during the pandemic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(JO): It can be easier to think about doing what optimists do rather than trying to think differently (or change your optimism). So, people with lower pessimism mentioned changing their behaviors to adapt to the situation, meeting with people on Zoom more frequently and exercising at home (vs. going to the gym and meeting up with people in person). It was these changes in behaviors like exercising more that partly helped people’s well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this study reveal about health and psychological well-being in the post-pandemic world? What factors can we consider for maintaining and improving mental health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(JO): There has been evidence before the pandemic that optimistic people fare well in many situations. Even though more research is needed to understand why, our study found that optimists fared better even during new difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, developing optimism and learning how to flexibly cope can help maintain and improve mental health in diverse situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a4c0d0c6c1d6cac5d6e4d7ddd68ac1c0d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Daniel Bernardi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://syr.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Syracuse University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Daniel Bernardi – Syracuse University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2024.104541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Optimism and pessimism were prospectively associated with adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;” by Jeewon Oh et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Research in Personality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimism and pessimism were prospectively associated with adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study, we examined the association between optimism/pessimism before the pandemic and adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, optimism was associated with behaviors that reduce COVID-19 transmission and higher psychological well-being (βs&amp;gt;|.196|) through changes in social contacts (indirect effect βs&amp;gt; |.004|) and/or increases in physical activity (βs=|.01|).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separating optimism and pessimism, we found that only pessimism was associated with behaviors that reduce risk, but &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; optimism and pessimism were associated with psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By investigating them in the context of new public health challenges, we found that while the presence of optimism and absence of pessimism may both be resources for well-being, the absence of pessimism may be particularly important for health-relevant behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 21:27:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1MUU1BN0lXck0tUVNjd2d3bzZBT0dHNWV6UTdWUmZEYldQRktWT0RBNVFudDJmcUhsRUwxcXJMdWFEZ0hRMmxjVHBfb0VzU0VWbFVnZ0xKV0lmWVoya0x4MHdxaXN4MERNOWRaOGdFUUNyNHc</guid></item><item><title>What happens when you diet by removing ultra-processed foods?

These guidelines do not mention ultra-processed foods (UPFs), even though they are linked to serious health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chips, candy, and other mass-produced &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-tool-lets-you-check-how-processed-your-food-is-grocerydb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;packaged foods&lt;/a&gt; often replace natural ingredients with additives. Studies show eating UPFs increases the risk of diseases and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these risks, no major dietary programs focus on reducing UPF intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, researchers from &lt;a href="https://drexel.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Drexel University&lt;/a&gt; designed an intervention. The goal was to help people eat fewer ultra-processed foods using multiple strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-ultra-processed-foods-the-basics"&gt;Understanding ultra-processed foods – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are the heavily modified, lab-created stuff you find in most grocery store aisles – think packaged snacks, sugary cereals, instant noodles, and even some protein bars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They go through multiple industrial processes, packed with additives like preservatives, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweetener-neotame-has-shocking-effects-on-gut-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;artificial flavors&lt;/a&gt;, emulsifiers, and loads of sugar or refined oils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These foods are designed to be super convenient, hyper-palatable, and have a long shelf life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the catch: they often lack real nutrition and can mess with your metabolism, gut health, and even brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies link them to everything from obesity and diabetes to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweetener-erythritol-sugar-substitute-linked-to-blood-clots-heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and even mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is, ultra-processed foods are everywhere, and they’re marketed as quick, tasty, and sometimes even “healthy” options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because they’re engineered for taste and texture, they can be addictive, making it easy to overeat without feeling full. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, their ingredient lists often look more like a chemistry experiment than actual food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reducing-ultra-processed-food-intake"&gt;Reducing ultra-processed food intake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Drexel University program went beyond education. It included mindfulness strategies to handle cravings, one-on-one meal planning, and household involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also provided financial support to help participants buy healthier foods, which can be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two-month intervention involved 14 adults with overweight or obesity who ate at least two UPF items daily. On average, participants cut their UPF intake by nearly half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing UPF intake can be extremely difficult, because the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ultra-processed-foods-make-our-bodies-age-faster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; industry wants us to be hooked on UPFs,” said lead author Dr. Charlotte Hagerman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The industry designs UPFs to be ultra-delicious, convenient, cheap, and constantly present in the U.S. – even if not directly in front of us, then on our TVs, phones, and roadside signs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-promising-results-from-the-intervention"&gt;Promising results from the intervention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the small sample size, the results of the trial were encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the program, participants had nearly halved their UPF &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-ultra-processed-foods-makes-your-muscles-weaker-and-more-fragile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;intake&lt;/a&gt;, measured both in calories and total items consumed. They also reduced their daily calorie intake by more than 600 calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar consumption declined by 50 percent, while saturated fat intake dropped by 37 percent. Sodium intake also saw a significant decrease of 28 percent. On average, participants lost 7.7 pounds over the two-month period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, participants did not have meaningful increases in their fruit and vegetable consumption, suggesting that if we want to improve dietary intake more holistically, we may need to more strongly encourage people to eat these foods,” said Hagerman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-intervention-worked"&gt;How the intervention worked&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants met weekly with health behavior coaches in both group and individual sessions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They learned how to identify UPFs, cope with cravings, and improve their home food environment. Each participant received a $100 grocery store gift card to support healthier purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To track progress, the participants completed detailed food intake reports. They documented everything they ate on selected weekdays and weekends using a specialized assessment tool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers classified foods as UPFs or non-UPFs, consulting experts when needed to avoid bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-psychological-benefits-of-cutting-upfs"&gt;Psychological benefits of cutting UPFs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond physical health, the participants noticed mental and emotional benefits. Many reported feeling better overall, with improvements in mood and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ultra-processed-foods-are-harmful-to-nearly-every-part-of-the-body/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since UPFs can trigger addiction-like behaviors, reducing intake may help regulate emotions and improve mental clarity. Cutting back on UPFs also seemed to help participants feel more in control of their eating habits, making it easier to maintain a healthier diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By addressing both the physical and psychological aspects of food choices, the program helped participants develop a healthier relationship with eating. This could be crucial for long-term success in maintaining dietary changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-for-research"&gt;Next steps for research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings suggest that people can reduce their ultra-processed food intake, if given the proper tools, and that they will be enthusiastic about interventions designed for this purpose,” said Hagerman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results also suggest that reducing UPF intake will lead to meaningful health improvements – such as weight loss and better mood – in as short as eight weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team plans to expand the study. Future work will test the intervention on a larger sample and evaluate which strategies are most effective. The researchers also want to see if the program works across different populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-bigger-picture"&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the need for better public awareness and policies to reduce UPF consumption. Since UPFs dominate the food supply, long-term solutions should address accessibility and affordability of healthier alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Education, financial incentives, and community-based programs could help more people reduce their UPF intake. As research continues, these findings may shape new approaches to improving public health through better nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/osp4.70029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Obesity Science &amp;amp; Practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 21:24:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQZzlvY1Ayb1dobWxfZDRmYjByU0tobVBpQUdXTkJWT29vR21nS2pKM3RiNG1fcWs4Z2tkTnJFWEZ4cGZ2Rl85YlVuSHZLWWcwRjhicW5hOGFzR2RkTndjZUhnXzY2SThVM3lTdHBHbkQzUWY2dlRwVFBOT1J3LTZJUWN3SnUxS1pmS0VSbnl5S3ZlQmswQWJ3UklvcWRmbFNC</guid></item><item><title>Popular diet followed by Joe Rogan can cause painful kidney stones, experts warn — and that’s not all - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPZXpmdjRKQXNaejg2X092T1hDb3ZJQU9aRmRYelJ0OVhudkg1SFR5WktvcTJMT1JzdWZFT1RBRW45NEJlWlhJMHJxMHpMbVY3TVZ6cjFBaUJsUl9JYUFPYnEwZEJMaHNJeWJWVVhZLTctUXBpMUxBMmlDSG5NdkJPdktyc3doX3d4d25DRXpsM3FkQWdOMWV5ZmxkRjQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;We’ve all scoured the internet for weight loss secrets. But just because the scale drops doesn’t mean your body’s on board.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just look at the carnivore diet. The eating plan — which involves consuming only animal byproducts such as meat, eggs and dairy — has taken off among &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/02/health/influencer-swears-by-carnivore-diet-but-experts-are-not-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fitness influencers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/11/health/influencer-lost-30-lbs-on-diet-of-butter-meat-golden-jello/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;across the internet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Devotees of the high protein, no-vegetable lifestyle swear it’s a game-changer for weight loss and overall health. Podcaster &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/tag/joe-rogan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://routines.club/routine/the-joe-rogan-carnivore-diet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;among the faithful&lt;/a&gt;, recently returning to the diet even after his first stint left him with &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a30675936/joe-rogan-carnivore-diet-diarrhoea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;explosive diarrhea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;While most kidney stones can pass naturally, the process can be incredibly painful. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Peakstock – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Podcasting giant Joe Rogan has publicly touted the carnivore diet.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But experts are sounding the alarm. Many have raised concerns about the diet’s &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/critical-thinking-student-contributors-health-and-nutrition/taking-bite-out-carnivore-diet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nutritional gaps&lt;/a&gt;, and now doctors from the Indiana University School of Medicine are warning that the carnivore diet could also increase the risk of painful kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These hard deposits, made up of minerals and salts, form in the kidneys due to diet, weight, and other factors. Most people can pass kidney stones naturally, though it can be incredibly painful. Depending on their size, they can block the flow of urine, leading to potentially life-threatening infections and the risk of sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;In a recent case study published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916524014199" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, doctors revealed that a 68-year-old man adopted the carnivore diet after discovering it on YouTube — only to suffer serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While he lost 24 pounds eating 90% meat products, tests conducted six months later showed his body was already forming kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Urine analysis revealed he had an increased risk of developing all three major types of kidney stones — calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and uric acid — with levels “consistent with stone growth.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A year after quitting the diet, the doctors reported that the patient was kidney stone-free. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They pointed to the patient’s results as evidence of the “potential hazards of the carnivore diet,” noting that it creates the “optimal environment” for kidney stone development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The lack of literature on this and other fad diets’ safety and efficacy should be a cause for alarm among physicians,” the doctors wrote. They recommended a fiber- and carbohydrate-rich diet to support gut bacteria and help prevent kidney stone formation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The medical community remains divided on the carnivore diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Red meat consumption has been linked to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and even some cancers.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;bit24 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some doctors have &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/is-the-carnivore-diet-bad-for-cholesterol#1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;raised concerns&lt;/a&gt; about the eating plan’s impact on cardiovascular health. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/20/health/red-and-processed-meats-linked-to-type-2-diabetes-risk-new-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Red meat&lt;/a&gt;, butter, and cheese are &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/20/health/red-and-processed-meats-linked-to-type-2-diabetes-risk-new-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;high in saturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, which can elevate levels of “bad” cholesterol in the blood, increasing the risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/04/health/61-of-us-adults-will-have-cardiovascular-disease-by-2050-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/21/lifestyle/how-to-prevent-a-stroke-stroke-association-issues-new-advice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While cutting back on &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/11/health/influencer-lost-30-lbs-on-diet-of-butter-meat-golden-jello/#:~:text=decrease%20intake%20of%20sugary" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sugary and refined carbs&lt;/a&gt; is generally a good idea, fruits and vegetables are a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/11/health/influencer-lost-30-lbs-on-diet-of-butter-meat-golden-jello/#:~:text=fruits%20and%20vegetables%20are%20a%20rich%20source%20of%20fiber%20and%20essential%20nutrients" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;rich source of fiber and essential nutrients&lt;/a&gt; that can help lower the risk of chronic diseases, manage blood pressure, aid in weight management and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/11/health/influencer-lost-30-lbs-on-diet-of-butter-meat-golden-jello/#:~:text=weight%20management%20and-,improve%20digestion,-." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;improve digestion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;And let’s not forget the side effects. When Rogan first tried the diet for a month in 2020, the podcasting giant said he lost weight and saw significant improvements in his energy levels and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s really only one ‘bad’ thing, and that thing is diarrhea,” Rogan wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/joerogan/p/B7LPdnHlto7/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2020 Instagram post&lt;/a&gt;. “I’ve come to accept that if I keep going with this diet it’s just a matter of time before we lose a battle, and I fill my undies like a rainforest mudslide overtaking a mountain road.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While diarrhea might be embarrassing, one Florida man’s symptoms were &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/24/health/bizarre-side-effect-of-extreme-carnivore-diet-leaves-mans-hands-covered-in-yellow-nodes/"&gt;downright bizarre&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After eating nothing but butter, cheese and hamburger patties for eight months, he showed up at a Tampa hospital with ooze leaking from yellowish nodes on the palms of his hands, elbows and the soles of his feet. Doctors later diagnosed him with xanthelasma, a condition caused by high cholesterol or excess fats in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cardiologists diagnosed the Florida man with xanthelasma, a condition caused by high cholesterol levels or other fats in the blood. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;JAMA Cardiologym 2024, Marmagkiolis et al&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Still, some experts argue the carnivore diet might benefit certain individuals. A few studies have identified positive outcomes, including a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2475299122106086?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2021 Harvard study&lt;/a&gt; that found “high levels of satisfaction and improvements in overall health, well-being, and various medical conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Georgia Ede, a Harvard-trained, board-certified psychiatrist specializing in nutritional and metabolic psychiatry, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/10/health/expert-shatters-myths-about-the-carnivore-diet-and-the-real-impact-it-has-on-your-health/"&gt;told Fox News&lt;/a&gt; she has found the carnivore diet to be an “indispensable tool” in her clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not possible to say with scientific certainty whether this dietary pattern (or any dietary pattern, for that matter) is ideal for everyone, but my clinical and personal experience tell me that a well-formulated carnivore diet can be uniquely healing for some of us,” Ede said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She noted that the diet could help identify food sensitivities, resolve chronic constipation and IBS symptoms, curb food addiction and binge-eating, and break weight loss plateaus.&lt;/p&gt;

They may well be sabotaging your heart health, new research suggests.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As detailed in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651324014593#sec0150" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;span&gt;recent study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a team of Chinese researchers found that rats that were given water &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that'd been boiled and then stored in common takeout lids showed significant disruptions in the gut biome, including inflammation — a common risk factor for cardiovascular disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In many cases, they also observed extensive damage to myocardial tissue, or heart muscle. The work is the latest to highlight the alarming toll that &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/brains-microplastics-study" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;exposure to ubiquitous microplastics&lt;/a&gt; can have on the body — and how &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/children-dying-chemicals-plastics" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;easily it can seep into our food and beverages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The data revealed that high-frequency exposure to plastics is significantly associated with an increased risk of congestive heart failure," the authors wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Besides a control group, the rats were divided into three groups that drank boiled water &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that'd been exposed to the plastic takeout containers — known as leachate — for one minute, five minutes, and fifteen minutes respectively. They drank this regularly for three months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Surprisingly, no single rat pack stood out; they all roughly exhibited the same degree of worrying symptoms, like changes to the composition of their intestinal microbacteria and damage to the heart muscle. This suggests that any amount of exposure could put you at risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The study shows plastic exposure as a significant [cardiovascular disease] risk factor regardless of duration," the author wrote. "It leads to changes in myocardial tissue, gut microbiota, and metabolites, all closely tied to [cardiovascular disease]."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along with the rat experiment, the team also surveyed nearly 3,200 people in China with self-reported questionnaires about how often they were exposed to plastics and about symptoms related to their cardiovascular health. This is flimsier stuff than the rat trials, but nonetheless, it found that frequent plastic exposure was linked to a higher risk of heart failure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are, however, some notable limitations to the study. Regarding the human survey, that there was a correlation between plastic exposure and heart failure may be due to "individual differences within the surveyed population," the authors wrote, noting that only exposure within the past month was investigated. No biological samples were taken from the human respondents, either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As for the rats, the scientists weren't able to measure the amount of and kinds of plastic particles in their bodies. And while there was notable damage to myocardial tissue, none of the rodents exhibited full-blown cardiovascular disease. Still, this may be because of the short nature of the experiment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Further research is necessary to elucidate the health impacts of long-term exposure to plastic products, as well as the accumulation and distribution of plastic particles in tissues and organs, to provide a theoretical foundation for the development of appropriate safety measures in the future," the authors conclude.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the meantime? They suggest avoid using plastic takeout containers for hot food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on plastics: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/microplastics-brain-vessels-clots-mice-scientists" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Microplastics Getting Stuck in Brain Vessels Like Clots, Scientists Find, Causing "Neurological Abnormalities" in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 17:00:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFBuai1iMVFSNWhiRGgxcGZJc3JqUExTTlR5RzBGMjdScEF1RF95N1hKS2VfY0pla3lZaE9fTGFQbFA0YjhOcUVfbVIteTVEaGRKRDNZb29UOUdtTHllalFnVnpSM0NmMGhocnZ3</guid></item><item><title>The sticky, slippery promise of castor oil packs - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE5RR1Frc01tVTdKQ3BEdXhKaklReWJWa2M0SFBCYjlHa3lqcURkQXhWYlc0anhVdTQ0M0p4TkwtQ2REdnNNeGxoY0pZZ2hBaXBUSnIzWVpJMG9hZ0p0TGttSTZRc3dEQjQ4UjBvdTVlbThYejBJU2djZmdfNHFKMWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZEEFBFFS6JFIDCEVWFM6UBFQE4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Before she goes to bed, Lisa Brezinski slathers on a thick, sticky layer of castor oil — often on her stomach, but sometimes on her neck or over her upper abdomen.

Daniel Ricciardi, a pharmacist, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGewmt38FoU" target="_blank"&gt;said in a YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; that “a lot of evidence [on castor oil packs] just does not exist right now, and there’s not a huge incentive for Pharma companies to fund a lot of studies for castor oil.” He noted that skin irritation and allergic reactions are possible but that using castor oil is “relatively safe if not ingested orally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4Z4HX73J5FHQHC7MMKYBNDMGLQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drrubainadang.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Rubaina Dang&lt;/a&gt;, a naturopathic doctor, said castor oil packs are “one of the oldest old-school tricks in the book.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GEWBWOW6VVGJVPYCIXRRDW6Z6U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For her patients with hormonal imbalances and digestive issues, she prescribes castor oil packs to help with symptom relief. She tells those with painful periods to either soak a piece of cloth in castor oil or roll the castor oil onto their abdomen or uterus area, apply another cloth over it, and then put a heating pad over that. She advises her patients to do this 3 to 5 times per week for about 30 to 60 minutes. She said there’s no exact recommendation for using castor oil packs and people need to find what works best for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QYHPYT3O6ZB5NDMT5W4CKHIGEI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Dang said castor oil may lead to uterine contractions, so people should not use it during their menstrual cycle, if they are pregnant or breastfeeding. She also said not to use it on an open wound or if you are dealing with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis flare-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YMXVQBDMXZE73FOMTPRKFNFGOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Beyond internal benefits, castor oil can clear your skin, Dang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P45ONOG5GND6ZCP4VUUB5V2ZJ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The liver plays a big role in skin health,” she&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;explained. The liver processes hormones and filters toxins, but when it’s sluggish, that excess waste doesn’t clear properly, leading to acne and rashes. “By supporting the body’s elimination pathways, like digestion and regular bowel movements, castor oil indirectly improves skin health,” Dang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="E7FFYCKWCRABRFSI5BMOUEHQ3Y" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="E7FFYCKWCRABRFSI5BMOUEHQ3Y"&gt;A nightly ritual&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VYFOI6PBU5GO5KUF2JTOTTBEF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Not everyone opts for a full-on castor oil pack. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ameliarrmei?_t=ZT-8tfHWk6wNtm&amp;amp;_r=1" target="_blank"&gt;Amelia Mei &lt;/a&gt;stumbled across one of her favorite influencers on Instagram raving about castor oil for bloating.

Doctors believed there was nothing they could do for him so he was sent home, where he said his family didn't realize he was still aware of his surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While trapped in his body, Mr Haendel heard nurses call him 'brain dead' and a family member say he would likely die soon, but the most shocking thing he heard was an argument between his father and then-wife, which ended in a violent altercation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jake Haendel detailed his journey with acute toxic leukoencephalopathy (ATL) on his TikTok, Instagram and a new podcast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel's ordeal began in May 2017. He was newly married and the head executive chef at a restaurant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One day, he noticed 'I kind of felt weird.' He had a higher pitched voice than normal, &lt;span&gt;his balance was unsteady and he swerving while driving. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ellen, now his ex wife, told him he should go to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He went to the emergency department and was admitted with stroke-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I still thought I would go home and it would be like any other time I was in the hospital... b&lt;span&gt;ut life would definitely never be the same.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time morning came, eight doctors surrounded Mr Haendel's bed with 'somber looks' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said doctors told him: 'We're so sorry you have six months to live. You have an extremely rare brain disease.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel, now 36 and a Boston resident, was diagnosed with acute toxic leukoencephalopathy (ATL), a condition that damages &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-13751285/husband-suffered-brain-injury-flung-motorbike-headfirst.html"&gt;brain regions that help with communication and body movements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel's condition specifically was acute toxic progressive leukoencephalopathy (ATPL), with 'progressive' indicating his symptoms were quickly worsening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This caused 'locked in syndrome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors told him his symptoms would get worse very quickly, taking away his ability to walk and confining him to a wheelchair. After that, his body would contract and he'd be in 'a lot of pain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then would lose the ability to eat, swallow and talk. Eventually he would need tubes to breath and a feeding tube to get nutrients 'until you slip into a coma and likely die.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was told there was no chance he would get better:&lt;span&gt; 'I wished they warned me how much pain I was actually going to be in.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As time went on, everything doctors said would happen did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ATL damages the brain's white matter, which connects brain regions that help with communication and body movements and plays a crucial role in cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;White matter is full of nerve fibers protected by a covering called myelin. Myelin protects the fibers and helps send messages and electrical signals in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Haendel said two nurses were gossiping in his room. When one said they shouldn't talk in front of the patient, the other responded saying he couldn't hear them because he was 'brain dead'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Damage to these interrupts the transmission of messages and communication between brain regions, leading to problems with movement and speaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ATL has multiple causes, including environmental toxins, pesticides, chemotherapy and drug abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors told Mr Haendel his condition resulted from a toxin he inhaled. He and his doctors aren't sure exactly what toxin, but Mr Haendel had been using heroin and he said he was regularly exposed to chemicals and pesticides in his day job as a chef. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ajnr.org/content/40/2/267"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;analyzing approximately 100 patients with ATL found opioids were the second most common cause of the condition (19 percent) and led to the second worst outcome in patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel was repeatedly transferred from long-term care facility to the hospital to rehab clinics since his illness was deemed terminal and doctors didn't know how to help him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All the while, Mr Haendel heard people discussing him, thinking he wasn't conscious. Little by little, he noticed the medical staff caring for him eventually stopped acknowledging and talking to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kelley_greene/locked-in-syndrome-survivor-jake-haendel"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kelley_greene/locked-in-syndrome-survivor-jake-haendel"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;BuzzFeed he heard a member of his medical team complaining about caring for him and when there was a discussion about the high costs he was incurring, one family member said: 'Well, I have a feeling the problem will work itself out any day now.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One day, two nurses entered his room gossiping. When one said they shouldn't talk in front of the patient, Mr Haendel said the other responded: 'Don't worry, he can't hear you. He's brain dead, anyway.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel thought: 'Holy s***, they think I'm brain dead? [I have to] let them know. During this time, I realized there was something scarier than death. I thought I might be stuck like this forever.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mr Haendel's condition specifically was acute toxic progressive leukoencephalopathy (ATPL), with 'progressive' indicating his symptoms were quickly worsening. This caused 'locked in syndrome,' a coma in which a person is still conscious&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3tYCFQIelKqSuNMP26QYDy"&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;on the podcast Blink: 'I just started to panic and freak out. Am I brain dead? Could it be? Is that possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Immediately I'm on a mission. I [have to] let them know I'm not brain dead.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors performed MRIs and EEGs &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14356349/first-recording-dying-human-brain-revealed-death.html"&gt;to determine brain function and activity&lt;/a&gt;, which showed a 'catastrophic' brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel said: 'There was no possible way any neurologist thought I was with it at all. Vegetative at best. Disconnected from all reality.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was experiencing 'locked in syndrome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel said 'doctors didn't know what to do with me. I wasn't getting better but I wasn't dying either. It felt like I was stuck in limbo.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point, he was sent home to be cared for. It was then that Ellen began isolating her husband from family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the little family she still allowed to visit, Ellen established a rigid care plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Mr Haendel's father was 45 minutes late for one of his care shifts, he and Ellen began yelling at each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel heard someone shouting 'You're strangling me! You're strangling me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said on Blink: 'Then I hear a bottle pop... like a two-liter Coke bottle [bouncing] off someone's head. Then I hear a human being tumbling down the stairs, crashing into the door and I hear my dad's mumbles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I want to say I heard "why did you do this to me?" and then I heard the door open and someone crawling out the door and the door pulled shut.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then heard Ellen calling 911, saying 'My father-in-law just tried to kill me. Tried to strangle me,' though Mr Haendel said he is almost certain the voice of the person who asked 'why did you do this to me?' was his father's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel added: 'And that's all I know. l did not see my father ever again or hear anything about him again or anyone in my family ever again.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While he detailed the incident on the Blink podcast, he has yet to reveal more details on anything following that event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he has detailed his recovery, which began when a doctor at Mass General Hospital in Boston noticed him make subtle movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel said the doctor asked: 'Hey, do you guys see that? I think he’s moving something.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the doctor was dismissed and told the movements were involuntary.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Haendel said on TikTok: 'He told me that if I could hear him, I should try to move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I gathered every bit of strength I had and tensed my whole body — and it actually worked. It was the first real sign of hope.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors brought in a nonverbal speech therapist who taught him how to communicate via blinking, then use a letterboard, on which he spelled out 'I can hear you.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2019, after intensive physical, occupational and speech therapy, he began to be able to move his neck and make primitive noises. Then came the use of his fingers and arms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of 2020, Mr Haendel was able to move home and for the last four years has been continuing therapy and is now learning to walk with a cane.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'At the end of 2020, after years of hard work, I finally moved back home, though I still needed 24-hour care. Today, I’m still recovering, but I’ve come a long way.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="21" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq9q22002m35739mj9gwvx@published"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://slate.com/theslatest?utm_source=slate&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_plain_text_topper"&gt;Sign up for the Slatest&lt;/a&gt; to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq4xtn002e5gm2xpfahtgo@published"&gt;My first pimple was a defining moment in my life. I recall feeling confused as to why something dreaded by teenagers was happening to me, a 9-year-old. That first pimple soon became my first breakout. From there, my skin never cleared up, despite spending a decade in and out of dermatology offices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5kxd000o3573snammxh9@published"&gt;During one of those doctor appointments, I was given antibiotics for my acne. According to my dermatologist, the constellation of zits that marred my face was likely an overgrowth of the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Cutibacterium acne&lt;/em&gt;. It’s well known that &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; play a key role in acne, so antibiotics to fight the bacterium seemed like the logical solution. We started with topical creams, which helped at first. Once those stopped working, potent oral antibiotics followed. No matter the treatment, the outcome was always the same: temporary improvement, only for the pimples to return with a vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5l01000p35736v51j836@published"&gt;By my mid-20s, it was clear that the acne was more than a lingering symptom of puberty; it was a chronic condition. I was facing the harsh reality that modern skin care may never give me a clear complexion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5l2m000q3573g2tfn2wq@published"&gt;That was also the time when I started my Ph.D. in food microbiology and was developing a deeper appreciation of bacterial systems. Naturally, I turned to examining my acne—and its refusal to leave my face—through the lens of a microbiologist. As it turns out, people blessed with healthy skin &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13578-023-01072-w"&gt;have comparable amounts of the bacteria &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;to those with acne. The devil’s in the details when we examine strain-level differences: acne-prone individuals tend to have a greater diversity of &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; strains—and that diversity includes more pathogenic strains.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5l6p000r3573omjxbf2a@published"&gt;Much to my chagrin, I learned there is a link between &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13578-023-01072-w"&gt;antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that the &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; strains that are antibiotic-resistant are the same strains causing aggressive breakouts. This explains why antibiotics failed me time and time again: They selected for the resistant and hypervirulent strains of &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt;. While they could briefly quell the bacterium on my face, the resistant strains just ended up taking over.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5l89000s35738e16s832@published"&gt;As a zit-faced grad student, I started a new research project that used lactic acid bacteria, or LAB, as a method for food safety. Basically, the idea was to explore how LAB could be used to colonize a food environment in order to prevent the outgrowth of spoilage or pathogenic bacteria. This is what’s known as a “protective culture”: we collaborate with good microbes in order to keep bad microbes—and foodborne illness—away. It’s the microbial approach to “the enemy of my enemy is my friend”; a strategic alliance that acknowledges not all bacteria are bad. Sometimes, we just want to create an environment with our &lt;em&gt;preferred&lt;/em&gt; microbial population.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lak000t357366fs772n@published"&gt;Spending long hours reading research on LAB amid a particularly disheartening breakout, I became fixated on the idea that the key to clearer skin lay in the strategic inclusion of beneficial bacteria through probiotics rather than the indiscriminate eradication of bacteria through broad-spectrum antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="23" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lct000u3573pfhn43p3@published"&gt;Assuming a bloom of virulent &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; was to blame, I hypothesized that recolonizing my skin microbiota with probiotic LAB could effectively treat my acne.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lfa000v35733z4hh6nn@published"&gt;It’s worth mentioning that LAB is an umbrella term for a group of bacteria that share certain characteristics, with the most notable being their ability to produce lactic acid. While &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/not-all-lactic-acid-bacteria-are-probiotics-but-some-are/9701ED42C873B008AF3F26F50132D2BF"&gt;not all LAB are classified as probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, LAB are the most commonly used probiotics in food products. In fact, yogurt, one of the most well-known probiotic foods, is a product of the LAB &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7602395/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Streptococcus thermophilus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus bulgaricus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which convert lactose (the sugar in milk) into lactic acid.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lhq000w35733bnd7oth@published"&gt;Given yogurt’s well-established ties to &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408398.2014.883356"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;, I wondered if its probiotic effect was transferable to my skin microbiome. Interestingly, in 1912, a scientist named Dr. J. Peyri documented &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9318165/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus bulgaricus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the first topical probiotic studied for skin diseases in a paper titled “Topical Bacteriotherapy of the Skin.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="23" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lka000x3573c1y9t4mr@published"&gt;So, channeling Peyri, I embarked on a borderline socially unacceptable experiment where I smeared yogurt on my face in the name of science.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lmo000y3573bbf3yzz0@published"&gt;My approach was simple: I applied plain yogurt on my face twice a day for roughly a month. I stuck with plain yogurt, avoiding flavored products containing added sugars, due to the potential link &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666328722000281"&gt;between high-glycemic diets and acne&lt;/a&gt;. While I wasn’t particular about brands, my main criterion was that the label indicated “live cultures,” which means that each gram contained at least 10 million LAB cells.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7dq5lrd00103573qquurnbp@published"&gt;I felt like I won the Nobel Prize for pimple science. Excited to share my findings with my sister-in-law, a fellow woman in STEM, I anticipated an enthusiastic discussion about microbiome science. Not wanting to burst my bubble, she gently informed me that &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dr-Tiwari-7/publication/383976966_A_comprehensive_review_of_acne's_facial_impact_and_the_therapeutic_potential_of_Indian_herbal_medicine/links/66e2d88ff84dd1716ce7a02e/A-comprehensive-review-of-acnes-facial-impact-and-the-therapeutic-potential-of-Indian-herbal-medicine.pdf"&gt;yogurt face masks&lt;/a&gt; have been a natural remedy in India for generations. It turns out that what I saw as a microbiology breakthrough was just common sense in Ayurvedic practice.&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jocd.14971"&gt;clinical study&lt;/a&gt; out of Srinakharinwirot University’s Medical School found that a probiotic lotion derived from&lt;em&gt; Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; decreased both the abundance of &lt;em&gt;C. acnes&lt;/em&gt; and inflammatory lesions in patients with mild to moderate acne, with effects lasting up to four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States officially launched its "war on cancer" by signing &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/overview/history/national-cancer-act-1971" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/overview/history/national-cancer-act-1971" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the National Cancer Act of 1971&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Broadly, the intention was to spur research into the biology of cancer to better treat — and potentially cure — the disease. However, the nation has now been embroiled in this "war" for over 50 years, and we are nowhere closer to victory, argues &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thebrooklyninstitute.com/people/nafis-hasan/" target="_blank" data-url="https://thebrooklyninstitute.com/people/nafis-hasan/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nafis Hasan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cancer scientist and associate faculty member at the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new book called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=74387&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FMetastasis-Rise-Cancer-Industrial-Complex-Horizons%2Fdp%2F1945335181%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dlivescience-us-6922625869473866119-20" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/Metastasis-Rise-Cancer-Industrial-Complex-Horizons/dp/1945335181" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=74387&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FMetastasis-Rise-Cancer-Industrial-Complex-Horizons%2Fdp%2F1945335181%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id="1471" data-merchant-network="Amazon" data-merchant-url="amazon.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Metastasis: The Rise of the Cancer-Industrial Complex and the Horizons of Care&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Common Notions, 2025), Hasan writes that cancer research has hyperfocused on finding treatments for individuals at the expense of driving down cancer rates overall. For example, in the passage below, he describes how a fixation on "somatic mutation theory" — which states that mutations in specific genes are the primary drivers of cancer — ignores the dangers of environmental carcinogens and the benefits of public health efforts in curbing cancer incidence and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/11041-10-deadliest-cancers-cure.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/11041-10-deadliest-cancers-cure.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 10 deadliest cancers, and why there's no cure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that cancer may be a hereditary disease can be traced back to the early twentieth century. Around 1900, the biologists Theodor Boveri and Walter Sutton rediscovered Gregor Mendel's laws of biological inheritance and proposed that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/27248-chromosomes.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/27248-chromosomes.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chromosomes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were responsible for inheriting biological traits. Boveri later proposed that a tumor cell arose when cell division went wrong and chromosomes were improperly distributed. In Boveri's view, "the problem of tumors is a cell problem." This was perhaps the first conceptualization of the "cancer cell," a lone culprit that could wreak havoc in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first experimental proof that cancer was potentially heritable came from Harvard scientist Ernest E. Tyzzer, who showed that the selective breeding of cancerous mice resulted in a disproportionately high rate of tumor incidence across generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of cancer as a genetic disease was also advanced by the eugenics movement, which performed cancer research to assure racial "purity" in the twenties and thirties. For example, the widely used Pap smear test for cervical cancer was first &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5972093/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5972093/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;presented at the Third Race Betterment Conference&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 1928. Nazi Germany's research on smoking and lung cancer claimed that differential cancer rates between Jews and "Aryans" was due to blood (not workplace chemical exposures). The U.S. private sector also held exclusionary views, with DuPont refusing to hire workers with a family history of cancer, given the high rates of bladder cancer among dye workers. The scientist Carl Weller, following his discovery of retinoblastoma (a tumor of the eyes) in children, advocated that parents of children with retinoblastoma be sterilized. As late as 1956, Wilhelm Hueper, the first Director of the Environmental Cancer Section of the NCI [National Cancer Institute], suggested that Black workers would be most suitable to workplaces where exposures to carcinogenic chemicals were unavoidable given their alleged resistance to the carcinogenic action of coal tar, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;UV radiation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and petroleum derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other scientists pushed back on these narratives of racial traits and cancer incidence. For instance, the notion that West Africans were racially predisposed to higher rates of liver cancer lost credibility when Japanese immigrants to the U.S. suffered the same type of cancer — the cause turned out to be &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/aflatoxins" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/aflatoxins" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;aflatoxins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [toxins produced by fungi that can end up on various crops] in their diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sQQWZCayvrPUkYyAdb4WjM" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sQQWZCayvrPUkYyAdb4WjM slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/rosalind-franklin-knew-dna-was-a-helix-before-watson-and-crick-unpublished-material-reveals" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/rosalind-franklin-knew-dna-was-a-helix-before-watson-and-crick-unpublished-material-reveals"&gt;&lt;u&gt;discovery of DNA's double helix structure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the fifties generated momentum for molecular biology, but the field did not concern itself with the cancer problem until the late seventies. Many molecular biologists were skeptical of government-sponsored research and worried they would lose their independence and be pushed to find cancer-causing viruses. Ironically, institutional support from the Special Virus Cancer Program (SVCP) later laid the foundations for the resurgence of a molecular theory of carcinogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This resurgence was driven by the SVCP director, Robert Huebner. Huebner was inspired by French studies showing that bacterial genes could remain in a repressed state and proposed the "oncogene theory" of carcinogenesis. In short, he believed there were cancer-causing genes that just needed to be identified. He previously confirmed that certain viruses gave rise to tumors in hamsters but wanted to dive deeper into how this happened. He suspected that viral genes were responsible for initiating tumors in the hamsters and, as the manager of SVCP's annual $10 million budget, he had the resources and authority to pour money into molecular cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early seventies, Huebner awarded millions of dollars to both private contractors and public institutions to study the molecular actions of viruses suspected of causing cancers in humans. However, by 1974, the White House's proposed budget for the NIH [National Institutes of Health] included three times as much funding for private contractors as for traditional research grants. The use of contract work was so extensive that by 1976, SVCP project officers worked in private contractor buildings (e.g., at Meloy Laboratories, Microbiological Associates, and Flow Laboratories). Huebner's largesse towards private contractors became a focal point of attack by molecular biologists suffering from financial precarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-left inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Nafis Hasan. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Courtesy of Nafis Hasan)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Watson (of Watson and Crick fame) established a virus cancer laboratory in 1968 and was appointed to the National Cancer Advisory Board in 1972, despite his objections to the War on Cancer. Molecular biologists like Watson posed an "anti-communist critique" of the War on Cancer by contending that government meddling in their disciplines stifled their freedom. Watson wanted to make molecular biology a major recipient of NIH and NCI funding, but without the government directing the research. He advocated for his friend, Norton Zinder, to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cshl.edu/archives/expanded-commentary/cancer-and-cronyism-at-the-nih-norton-zinder-and-the-special-virus-cancer-program/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cshl.edu/archives/expanded-commentary/cancer-and-cronyism-at-the-nih-norton-zinder-and-the-special-virus-cancer-program/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lead a committee to investigate the work&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the VCP in 1974. [The Special Virus Cancer Program (SVCP) was later called just the Virus Cancer Program (VCP).]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subsequent Zinder Report was the nail in the coffin for the VCP, which was already under pressure from Congress for its inability to produce results about cancer-causing viruses or vaccines to fight them. While Watson and other molecular biologists decried the use of contracts and the VCP's goals, they readily used VCP funds and infrastructure to continue their own research. In fact, VCP infrastructure supported oncogene theory all the way to its final iteration, the somatic mutation theory (SMT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMT postulates that cancer is caused by mutations that either permanently activate or repress genes. The first validation came in 1976 with the discovery of gene &lt;em&gt;src &lt;/em&gt;in normal human cells. Continued VCP support allowed researchers at the University of California, San Francisco to grow, develop, and hone the technique of molecular hybridization, which would be instrumental in detecting the&lt;em&gt; src&lt;/em&gt; gene in human cells. By the late seventies, molecular biologists and viral cancer researchers had cataloged several viral genes suspected of causing human cancers. However, absolute proof of human gene involvement in carcinogenesis was still missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not until 1982 that Robert Weinberg would find the missing link — using hybridization probes, he showed the presence of &lt;em&gt;v-ras&lt;/em&gt; in a human bladder cancer tissue specimen. In 1983, SMT was further boosted by the discovery of proteins involved in carcinogenesis. All these discoveries and advancements — hybridization probes, viral gene catalogs, and purified proteins from viruses — were products of the VCP's financial and material infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMT eventually surpassed viral carcinogenesis theory as the leading theory of carcinogenesis and gained social and institutional acceptance (e.g., the prestigious Lasker Awards &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/1983-albert-lasker-basic-medical-research-award/" target="_blank" data-url="https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/1983-albert-lasker-basic-medical-research-award/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;went to oncogene researchers in 1982&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Vincent DeVita, the Director of the NCI under Reagan, recommitted the Institute's budget to genetic research and further cut the environmental carcinogen testing program. The discovery of oncogenes and related proteins also opened a new arena for cancer therapies and fueled pharmaceutical industry interest in collaborations with universities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most scientific retellings of this history suggest that the shift from environmental carcinogens to viruses and, ultimately, to individuals' genes happened in the vacuum of universal knowledge creation. Nevertheless, a confluence of neoliberalism, libertarian ideology, and government policy cemented the idea that genes are responsible for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhat problematically, experimental evidence indisputably determined that genetic fragments found in cancerous cells are also found in normal cells. However, the explanation for this fact was constructed by social and political forces. As early as 1975, the American Business Cancer Research Foundation, funded largely by the chemical industry, tried to shift the focus away from prevention and towards identifying the "underlying mechanism." The Reagan administration was more than happy to advance these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molecular biologists, who once decried the VCP's use of contracts, were more than happy to participate in private-public collaborations that directed money to their labs. Some had even publicly cautioned against environmental regulations when the NCI, under the previous Carter administration, moved to increase funding for environmental carcinogenesis research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMT renewed the biomedical settlement — a commitment to treating diseases instead of preventing them. It also facilitated the real subsumption of academic research under capitalism and, consequently, an explosive growth of the cancer drug market and capital accumulation by the biotech and pharma industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this line of attack in the War on Cancer has had few meaningful outcomes for cancer patients. After more than four decades since the discovery of the first oncogene, Robert Weinberg candidly reflected on his discovery of &lt;em&gt;ras&lt;/em&gt;: "The greatest decreases in cancer-associated mortality have come from reductions in disease incidence [prevention] rather than treatment, such as the therapies that some anticipated would flow directly from RAS research."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered a virus that can enter human cells in a similar way to the virus that causes COVID-19. But the germ — HKU5-CoV-2 — doesn’t enter cells as effectively, so experts caution the findings shouldn’t be “overblown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China described the virus and potential treatments for infections in the journal &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8" aria-label="Cell"&gt;&lt;em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8"&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is HKU5-CoV-2?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HKU5-CoV-2 is a virus found in bats. It’s a type of coronavirus, a large group of germs that can affect mammals and birds. Some have passed from animals to humans, like SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. Some coronaviruses cause mild symptoms in humans, while others can be lethal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists study viruses like HKU5-CoV-2 to find out how they work and how readily they might pass to humans. The Wuhan Institute researchers tested the newly-discovered germ in test tubes and models of the human gut and airways to investigate its transmission potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found the virus’s spike protein was able to bind with the membrane of human cells via a receptor enzyme that sits on their surface. This protein has a feature called a “furin cleavage site” that helps it latch on to the receptor enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Is HKU5-CoV-2 A Threat To Humans?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This potential transmission pathway is similar to that of the highly-contagious SARS-CoV-2. But although it was better adapted to human cells than certain other similar viruses, HKU5-CoV-2 did not infect human cells as readily as SARS-CoV-2. In fact, it was significantly worse at binding to human cells, among other limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, scientists have urged caution over the results. The researchers themselves wrote in their study that the “risk of emergence in human populations should not be exaggerated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Minnesota infectious disease expert Dr. Michael Osterholm told &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/chinese-researchers-find-bat-virus-enters-human-cells-via-same-pathway-covid-2025-02-21/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/chinese-researchers-find-bat-virus-enters-human-cells-via-same-pathway-covid-2025-02-21/" aria-label="Reuters"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; the reaction to the research was “overblown.” He said it was also possible that increased immunity to similar viruses could help protect the public from another &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherinehignett/2024/11/07/uk-to-launch-world-first-genomics-led-pandemic-warning-system/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherinehignett/2024/11/07/uk-to-launch-world-first-genomics-led-pandemic-warning-system/" target="_self" aria-label="pandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Despite these calls for caution, the news appears to have boosted shares in the manufacturers behind vaccines for &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherinehignett/2024/03/31/covid-19-brings-down-healthy-life-expectancy-in-the-uk/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherinehignett/2024/03/31/covid-19-brings-down-healthy-life-expectancy-in-the-uk/" target="_self" aria-label="COVID-19"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. Shares of Pfizer, Moderna and Novovax rose on Friday following the news, according to &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://news.google.com/read/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQbWhIWDFBb2thbGE1ODVGLU9aM2VQZVJHbjF0NEVyR1UwODZPeExRQ0pwYXkxSUtDOWt0WWZTV1g5RjNJSDNYOF9meWlKdUNrcHVGVXpjcE9VZGVQUTZpX1M3Vk1RLUhITGM4NHNySDhHVTZ4OE9LVHZFTmZhdEs1Nk9DUjd0OTJXRzNfdlN2UGYxVThGdFVUNHlDSXBLN3F0cXpJMVZVU1AwQ1ZJOG5IVnl3?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://news.google.com/read/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQbWhIWDFBb2thbGE1ODVGLU9aM2VQZVJHbjF0NEVyR1UwODZPeExRQ0pwYXkxSUtDOWt0WWZTV1g5RjNJSDNYOF9meWlKdUNrcHVGVXpjcE9VZGVQUTZpX1M3Vk1RLUhITGM4NHNySDhHVTZ4OE9LVHZFTmZhdEs1Nk9DUjd0OTJXRzNfdlN2UGYxVThGdFVUNHlDSXBLN3F0cXpJMVZVU1AwQ1ZJOG5IVnl3?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" aria-label="Bloomberg"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Might HKU5-CoV-2 Be Treated?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should a bat virus like HKU5-CoV-2 infect a human, the researchers said monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs might help treat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antiviral drugs are designed to stop the spread of virus around the body, potentially easing symptoms and shortening illness. They’re used to treat a range of illnesses, including flu and COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monoclonal antibodies are proteins made in labs to target a wide range of illnesses, including cancer. They have been tailored to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, for example, to try and prevent it from infecting human cells — a treatment that’s especially important for people with weak immune systems who may not gain strong protection from vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can be highly effective treatments, but their efficacy for COVID-19 varies depending on the variant a patient contracts. So scientists had to develop new monoclonal antibody treatments quickly to try and keep up with the mutating virus.&lt;/p&gt;

Added sugars in processed foods contribute to insulin resistance, leading to type 2 diabetes. High sugar intake also promotes inflammation, elevates blood pressure, and increases the risk of fatty liver disease. Additionally, sugar is detrimental to dental health, causing cavities and decay.

                        &lt;p&gt;If a pregnant woman takes &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/acetaminophen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;acetaminophen&lt;/a&gt;, an ingredient found in pain relievers like Tylenol, Excedrin, and Panadol, her &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/child-adhd-risk-linked-to-mothers-use-of-acetaminophen#:~:text=Despite%20acetaminophen's%20classification%20as%20low,spectrum%20disorder%2C%20the%20researchers%20noted." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;unborn child could develop attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; (ADHD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a study published Feb. 6 in Nature Mental Health reported by &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/child-adhd-risk-linked-to-mothers-use-of-acetaminophen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;UW News&lt;/a&gt;, the findings suggest that doctors should reconsider prescribing medications with acetaminophen to mothers during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior research shows that upward of 70% of pregnant women use acetaminophen during pregnancy to control pain or reduce fever. The drug, which is the active ingredient of many pain-relief medications, is one of the few considered safe to take during pregnancy by the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National News:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://mynorthwest.com/national/alabama-house-expedites-medicaid-for-pregnant-women-joining-other-states-with-high-mortality-rates/4046181"&gt;Alabama House expedites Medicaid for pregnant women, joining other states with high mortality rates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Acetaminophen is a common ingredient for pain relief&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen is a common ingredient in over 600 different medications, both prescription and over-the-counter (OTC). Vicodin, Percocet, and Tylenol with Codeine are also over-the-counter medicines containing the pain reliever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most of the prior studies asked women to self-report whether they had taken Tylenol or anything that contained acetaminophen,” Brennan Baker, a researcher at Seattle Children’s Research Institute, told UW News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen is often &lt;a href="https://www.bemedwise.org/health-research-and-reports/health-resources-and-toolkits/acetaminophen/acetaminophen-containing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;used to treat&lt;/a&gt; mild to moderate pain, such as headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, and toothaches, and to reduce fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This medication was also approved decades ago, and may need reevaluation by the FDA,” Dr. Sheela Sathyanarayana, a UW Medicine pediatrician, told UW News. “Acetaminophen was never evaluated for fetal exposures in relations to long-term neurodevelopmental impacts.”&lt;/p&gt;
                            
                        
&lt;p&gt;The children born to 300 mothers who agreed to give blood samples during pregnancy were followed for 8 to 10 years. Among the women who did not use acetaminophen during pregnancy, the rate of ADHD was 9%, but for the women who used acetaminophen, the ADHD rate was 18%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New study suggests higher risk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite acetaminophen’s classification as low risk by regulatory agencies such as the FDA, new evidence suggests a potential link between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and adverse outcomes, like ADHD and ADHD autism spectrum disorder, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association was stronger among daughters than sons, with the daughters of acetaminophen-exposed mothers showing a 6.16 times higher likelihood of ADHD while the association was weaker and nonsignificant in males. Researchers did not know why the association was stronger in females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker said mothers are often told to use acetaminophen, the primary agent in Tylenol, instead of ibuprofen, which is more likely to affect the fetal kidney or heart adversely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(Acetaminophen) is really the only option to control fever or pain during pregnancy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There needs to be more research to figure out if some women can tolerate acetaminophen during pregnancy with no ill effects on the fetus while others cannot, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is obviously more work that needs to be done in this area,” Baker explained. “And we need to continually update our guidance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s also the possibility of reassortment within animals like cows, now that there are multiple variants detected in herds, she pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;At the same time, the CDC’s seasonal flu vaccination campaigns were halted on Thursday as the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; for “informed consent” advertisements instead. A meeting for the independent vaccine advisers was also &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;postponed&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The US has also halted communication with the World Health Organization on influenza data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The new spillovers into dairy cattle in Nevada and Arizona, detected through the new bulk milk testing strategy recently implemented in the US, are both related to the D1.1 variant of H5N1, which emerged in the fall and has come to dominate among North American birds. A teenaged girl in British Columbia suffered severe illness and a man in Louisiana died after infection with this variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In Nevada, a dairy worker was infected after close contact with cows, and genomic sequencing revealed a mutation that has been associated in the past with more effective spread among people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“These are more opportunities for the virus to continue to adapt, and with adaptation, you worry that we’ll ultimately get to a point where we may have a virus that becomes capable of transmitting efficiently between humans, and that then really would change the dynamic of the outbreak,” Titanji said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Lakdawala raised three theories for how bird flu keeps spilling over into cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The first would be a rare event in which fluids from a sick bird somehow came into contact with a cow’s udders – for instance, if a bird defecated into milking equipment. That was a working theory for the first spillover, detected nearly a year ago in Texas cows. But it’s rare for birds to have close contact with milking equipment, and for that to happen three times was “unlikely”, Lakdawala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It’s much more common for birds to perch on feeding troughs, where their feces might mix with feed. Usually, cows infected through oral or nasal contact like this don’t see the virus spread to their udders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But it could happen in rare events – if a cow is unhealthy, for instance – that bird flu goes systemic and enters mammary tissue, where it replicates in enormous quantities, Lakdawala hypothesized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The third theory? People could be spreading the virus from birds, or another intermediate species, to cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Bird to human infections, we know happen more often,” Lakdawala said. “It’s more likely that somebody handling dead birds or chickens infected with H5 will become infected, and then it’s human to cow” transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All of these theories need more evidence and research, much of which is now threatened by halts in scientific funding from the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Two studies temporarily halted in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report have now been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Blood tests on 150 veterinarians &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7404a2.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; three of the vets showed recent infection with H5N1. One of the infected vets worked in a state with no cases among cows, and the two others did not realize they had had contact with an H5-positive animal, indicating continued gaps in monitoring spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7405a2.htm?s_cid=mm7405a2_w" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on two households in Michigan indicated that dairy workers may have spread H5N1 to their indoor cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kevin Hassett, director of the national economic council, unveiled the Trump administration’s new strategy on CBS’s &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-hassett-face-the-nation-transcript-02-16-2025/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Face the Nation&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday in a shift away from trying to contain the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Previously, officials “spent billions of dollars just randomly killing chickens within a perimeter where they found a sick chicken”, Hassett said. Infected poultry are culled in this manner because they are very unlikely to survive infection, and containment like this can help halt the spread to other animals – and to the people who care for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Hassett instead broached the idea, without providing more details, of using “biosecurity and medication” to “have a better, smarter perimeter”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 13:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE1kU21VcVJXSXdxa0JTaTJzN0JlWHRVWjFGMGFKTjJ6RnJRU3BzbDlhekdHRkV6UnhJRE1iTndhaXc5VEloTVNsWmp2MV9aR2ZnUWR0YVExQ3hRUzJQa0R5aDBBWFA4UjdsS1VQYXhFOThBbHUtd01j</guid></item><item><title>Do You Always Remember Your Dreams?

              &lt;p&gt;How frequently do you remember dreams? Have you ever woken up knowing you’ve dreamed but been unable to recall the details? It turns out that the ability to remember a dream might be influenced by a combination of factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers in Italy spent the past four years studying “morning dream recall,” as it’s termed, publishing their &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00191-z"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; on Monday in the journal&lt;em&gt; Communications Psychology.&lt;/em&gt; Their work explores how various traits and behaviors seemingly influence our ability to remember our dreams when we wake up. Understanding the dynamics of morning dream recall has significant implications for studying dreaming as a whole—a mysterious brain function that continues to evade precise scientific understanding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that dream recall is not just a matter of chance but a reflection of how personal attitudes, cognitive traits, and sleep dynamics interact,” lead author Giulio Bernardi, a psychologist from the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca, said in a university &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1073502"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “These insights not only deepen our understanding of the mechanisms behind dreaming but also have implications for exploring dreams’ role in mental health and in the study of human consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bernardi and his colleagues studied over 200 participants between the ages of 18 and 70. The researchers asked the participants to record their dreams and to wear a sleep monitoring wristwatch for a 15-day period. Before and after this period, participants completed tests and questionnaires on various personal topics, including their interest in dreams, tendency toward distraction, and anxiety levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers observed a wide range of morning dream recall abilities among participants, along with several potential influencing factors. For example, people with a self-reported positive view on dreams and a tendency to daydream remembered their dreams more frequently. The seasons seemed to play a role as well, as there was an overall higher rate of dream recall during the spring across participants as opposed to during the winter.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;People who spent more time in light sleep, as well as young people in general, were also more likely to remember their dreams. Older people, on the other hand, more often woke up with the feeling they’d dreamt, but were unable to remember the dream—a phenomenon the researchers called “white dreams.” Interestingly, their “observations support the notion that white dreams represent actual dream experiences, with memories of their content fading upon waking,” they wrote in the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Data collected within this project will serve as a reference for future comparisons with clinical populations,” said Valentina Elce, first author of the study and a PhD student in cognitive, computational, and social neurosciences also at the IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca. “This will allow us to move forward the research on the pathological alterations of dreaming and their potential prognostic and diagnostic value.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s worth emphasizing that dreams are self-reported, making the study vulnerable to biases. However, Bernardi, Elce, and their colleagues’ identification of potential influences on morning dream recall nevertheless sheds light on a mysterious brain function that has captivated humanity for millennia.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sarah Blackburn wanted peace of mind. Instead, she got an appointment to have her spleen removed.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p class="primis-wrapper ad-wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;span class="ad-wrapper__text"&gt;Featured Video&lt;/span&gt;
      
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8YRKvXB/"&gt;now-viral TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, Blackburn recounts how she and her husband booked full-body MRIs at Prenuvo, a medical imaging company known for its early detection scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-full-body-mri-reveals-an-unpleasant-surprise"&gt;A full-body MRI reveals an unpleasant surprise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We scheduled to have them done in Dallas, which is about four hours away from us in Houston, and we were gonna make a trip out of it and we were so excited,” she said. But after some hesitation (“maybe we don’t really wanna know”), they canceled.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Eight months later, she finally went through with it at the new Houston location. “I was treating it like a spa day. I was so excited and like taking pictures in my little scrubs,” she said, raving about the experience. “Everything at Prenuvo was great. I got to watch Netflix, and the waiting room was nice and everything was super pretty and clean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was also expecting a clean bill of health. Instead, she got a late-night results email that sent her into a spiral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-shocking-diagnosis"&gt;The shocking diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackburn received her results four days later at 8:30pm. “I had nobody to call,” she said. Her follow-up with a nurse practitioner was scheduled within 24 to 48 hours, but in the meantime, she panicked. “I just went into a full-blown panic attack when I got my results and ended up in the emergency room because I needed a doctor to tell me what this meant.”&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The report? “One in three mortality rate,” she recalled. “Like OK, thank you so much.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prenuvo had found an aneurysm on her splenic artery, a discovery that quickly escalated after further testing. “I got a CT scan. There are actually two aneurysms inside of my splenic artery.” Yikes. The solution? “Now I am getting my spleen removed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-internet-reacts"&gt;The internet reacts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenters had a lot to say about Blackburn’s experience. Some shared how Prenuvo scans helped ease their own health anxieties. “I got it done and I have health anxiety and they didn’t find anything and it really helped my anxiety going forward,” one user wrote, to which &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8YRwQvn/"&gt;Blackburn responded with another video&lt;/a&gt; to soothe the qualms of hypochondriacs. Others, however, were more concerned with the price tag. “I wish insurance covered this every 10 years as part of preventative medicine,” another commented.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Her story even inspired others to book their own scans. One woman, who appeared to be a nurse, shared, “I just went today for a Prenuvo scan and the other guy waiting in his room said he was there because a girl on TikTok found an aneurysm and I said THAT’S WHY I’M HERE. You are sending us all!” Blackburn responded, “Wait this is the coolest thing I’ve ever heard. Following you now so you can update me on your results!” Keep us posted, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another user shared her heartbreaking experience: “My brother-in-law just died of a splenic artery aneurysm. He was 39 and extremely healthy. You are so so lucky.” Blackburn expressed her condolences and said, “I feel very fortunate that I can get it taken care of &amp;amp; you sharing this is such a big reminder of that.” If this isn’t a wakeup call to prioritize your health, nothing else is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-does-a-prenuvo-scan-cost"&gt;How much does a Prenuvo scan cost?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A full-body scan is about $2,500. Just the torso is about half that. And a head and torso scan is $1,800. It can detect aneurysms, cysts, hematomas, neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and dementia, metabolic disorders such as fatty liver, degenerative spines, and solid tumors as early as stage 1. Overall, it can &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/prenuvo-full-body-mri-scan-7693049"&gt;detect 500 conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Prenuvo scans are not covered by insurance, per &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/prenuvo-full-body-mri-scan-7693049"&gt;Verywell Health&lt;/a&gt;. As they note:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many radiologists have been wary of full-body imaging for decades. Major medical organizations, including the &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/collections/choosing-wisely/250.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American College of Preventive Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.acr.org/Media-Center/ACR-News-Releases/2023/ACR-Statement-on-Screening-Total-Body-MRI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American College of Radiology&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/medical-x-ray-imaging/full-body-ct-scans-what-you-need-know" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;, say there’s limited evidence that these preventive screenings are cost-effective or beneficial for healthy people. There are also no insurance companies that cover the service through companies like Prenuvo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I am truthfully doubtful of whole-body screening, for example, to detect a hernia. If the hernia is not creating any issue, I’m not sure detecting it is necessarily helpful. And many times, it’s unclear that anything needs to be done and it creates unnecessary anxiety in some patients,” Zhen Jane Wang, MD, a radiologist at the University of California San Francisco, told Verywell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-should-you-get-a-prenuvo-scan"&gt;Should you get a Prenuvo scan?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prenuvo offers full-body MRIs designed to detect early signs of cancer, aneurysms, and other potentially life-threatening conditions. But as Blackburn’s story highlights, the psychological impact of these results can be intense—especially for those prone to anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;“I have a lot of friends ask me if I regret it,” Blackburn said. I mean, she’s having a lifesaving surgery soon so that should answer that question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would she recommend it? “I was just a normal anxious girlie before this, and now I’m a normal anxious girlie with debilitating health anxiety that I’m trying to overcome.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackburn did not respond to the Daily Dot for comment, but she did generously share a Prenuvo discount link in her bio for those brave enough to uncover the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarblackburn/video/7463201078146993454" data-video-id="7463201078146993454"&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt; recently used computed tomography (CT) scans to analyze skulls excavated from the Varnhem burial ground, one of Sweden’s earliest Christian settlements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41405-025-00309-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;British Dental Journal Open&lt;/a&gt;, reveal widespread signs of infection and disease among individuals who lived between the 10th and 12th centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of CT imaging in osteoarchaeology allows scientists to see beneath the surface of ancient bones without damaging them. Unlike traditional X-rays, which provide two-dimensional images that can overlap, CT scans generate detailed three-dimensional images. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technology, first introduced in 1971 for medical diagnostics, has become an essential tool in paleopathology. It enables researchers to detect conditions that would otherwise remain hidden, such as infections in the skull or signs of osteoarthritis in the jawbone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The Viking skulls turned out to provide extensive information about a number of morbid conditions, without any damage to the remains.

They examined the skeletal remains of 15 individuals and found evidence of chronic infections, degenerative diseases, and extensive dental problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="painful_lives_and_limited_medical_care"&gt;Painful Lives and Limited Medical Care&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Viking-era population of Varnhem suffered from a range of ailments, including sinus and ear infections that left lasting damage on their skulls. CT scans revealed pathological &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-3d-print-living-human-skin-and-hair-follicles-directly-onto-the-body/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bone growths&lt;/a&gt; in the cranium and jaw, indicating long-standing infections. Many of these individuals likely experienced severe pain without access to effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was much to look at. We found many signs of disease in these individuals. Exactly why, we don’t know,” said Bertilsson. “While we can't study the damage in the soft tissue because it's no longer there, we can see the traces left in the skeletal structures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dental diseases were also common. The analysis of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/worlds-first-drug-to-regrow-teeth-is-now-in-clinical-trials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Viking teeth&lt;/a&gt;, conducted in a previous study, had already revealed widespread dental caries and maxillofacial infections. The latest research confirmed that these issues often progressed to severe conditions affecting the jawbone. Given the lack of antibiotics or modern dental care, even minor infections could have led to long-term suffering or even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the benefit of today’s medical knowledge, Viking-era individuals faced chronic pain with few options for relief. “Everyone knows what it’s like to have pain somewhere. You can get quite desperate for help,” Bertilsson noted. “But back then, they didn’t have the medical and dental care we do, or the kind of pain relief—and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/revolutionary-ai-discovers-previously-unknown-antibiotics-to-kill-lethal-bacterial-infections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;—we now have. If you developed an infection, it could stick around for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="ct_imaging_preserves_historical_integrity"&gt;CT Imaging Preserves Historical Integrity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists and osteologists have long relied on physical examinations and traditional radiographic techniques to study ancient remains. However, CT imaging offers a non-invasive alternative that preserves skeletal integrity while uncovering new details. It is particularly valuable for studying intact skulls and undamaged bone tissue, where external examinations might miss key findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Pathological conditions and numbers of affected individuals.

In the case of the Viking skulls, the technique provided a deeper understanding of the health conditions these individuals endured. The ability to analyze bones in layers allowed researchers to pinpoint signs of inflammation and chronic illness that would be difficult to detect otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bertilsson and her team hope this study will pave the way for more extensive research using &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/ai/3d-body-scanner-breakthrough-uses-ai-to-predict-metabolic-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CT imaging&lt;/a&gt;. “Very many of today’s archaeological methods are invasive, with the need to remove bone or other tissue for analysis. This way, we can keep the remains completely intact yet still extract a great deal of information,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_glimpse_into_viking_age_life"&gt;A Glimpse into Viking-Age Life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Viking-era remains excavated from Varnhem offer a rare glimpse into the past. Their well-preserved condition, thanks to the mineral-rich burial environment, has allowed researchers to study them in detail. With CT imaging, scientists can continue to uncover insights about health, disease, and lifestyle in medieval Scandinavia without damaging these historical artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Computed tomography provide 3D photos and the possibility of advanced image analysis where layer by layer of bones, jaw bones and teeth are studied in detail.

			&lt;p&gt;Just two servings of yogurt a week may protect the bowels from some specific types of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="152333" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new long-term study in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years now, scientists have suspected yogurt and its living bacteria have benefits for gastrointestinal health, and yet &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35692761/"&gt;not all research&lt;/a&gt; on the topic aligns on what those benefits are and when they are reaped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new analysis helps explain some of the confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, epidemiologists did not find a significant association between yogurt and the overall incidence of colorectal cancer – the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8276357/"&gt;third most common cancer worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when researchers split colorectal cancer cases into subtypes, they did find a significant result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings align with several other &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14122506"&gt;observational studies&lt;/a&gt;, which suggest yogurt intake may have anti-tumor properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study provides unique evidence about the potential benefit of yogurt," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/long-term-yogurt-intake-lower-colorectal-cancer-rates"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Shuji Ogino from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My lab's approach is to try to link long-term diets and other exposures to a possible key difference in tissue, such as the presence or absence of a particular species of bacteria. This kind of detective work can increase the strength of evidence connecting diet to health outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the results are only observational, they cover the health and self-reported lifestyles of 87,000 females and close to 45,000 males, tracked for three decades or more. Ogino and his colleagues' dataset encompasses a combined total of over 3 million years of individual follow-up data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer who consumed two or more servings of yogurt a week were 20 percent less likely to have a &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt;-positive tumor compared to those who consumed less than one serving of yogurt a month. This was especially true for proximal tumors in the upper part of the intestinal tract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifidobacterium"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are microbes that are ubiquitous in the human intestine and in the average bowl of yogurt. In about 30 percent of colorectal cancer cases, this bacterium is incorporated into tumor tissue, where it is commonly associated with a &lt;a href="https://www.wjgnet.com/1948-5204/full/v8/i12/819.htm"&gt;particularly aggressive form&lt;/a&gt; of the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152345" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152345" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-642x343.png" alt="Bifidobacterium Role" class="size-medium wp-image-152345" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-642x343.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-776x415.png 776w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-768x411.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-1536x821.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-2048x1095.png 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Bifidobacterium-600x321.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152345" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Role of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; in gut health.

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps counterintuitively, eating more &lt;i&gt;Bifidobacterium &lt;/i&gt;could help prevent this leakage in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article-abstract/18/4/858/683400"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sweetening-your-yogurt-with-honey-could-boost-its-probiotic-benefits"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; the bacterium may have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune activation effects, possibly impacting the integrity of the gut microbiome and the intestine's semipermeable barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not yogurt can deliver these benefits will require further research, but observational evidence is mounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our finding suggests that yogurt intake might have a cancer-preventive effect for colorectal cancer with disrupted intestinal barrier," the authors of the current analysis &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2452237"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Further studies are warranted to elucidate the potential mechanisms for the effects of long-term yogurt intake on colorectal carcinogenesis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152347" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152347" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer-642x376.png" alt="Colon Cancer Graph" class="size-medium wp-image-152347" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer-642x376.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer-708x415.png 708w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer-768x450.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer-600x352.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/YangColonCancer.png 1262w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152347" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Locations of colon cancer.

These types of cancers are also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8276357/"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that food could work as preventative medicine is worth exploring further. A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.06.019"&gt;randomized trial&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 from Stanford University found that fermented foods like yogurt can influence the microbiome and immune system in healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologist Andrew Chan from Massachusetts General Hospital, who was part of the recent analysis, &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/long-term-yogurt-intake-lower-colorectal-cancer-rates"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; their paper "adds to the growing evidence that illustrates the connection between diet, the gut microbiome, and risk of colorectal cancer."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It provides an additional avenue for us to investigate the specific role of these factors in the risk of colorectal cancer among young people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2452237"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gut Microbes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALDEN, N.Y. — People gathered Friday evening in Alden, in prayer and support for a young girl who is fighting for her life.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family of 9-year-old Mia Klyczek shared that she was taken to the emergency room on Wednesday, when she &lt;a href="/article/news/health/peak-flu-health-sick-people/71-be5b2981-71a0-448c-980c-4bddcc619183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;tested positive for the flu&lt;/a&gt;. This led to bleeding and severe swelling in her brain. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mia's mother shared Friday on social media that an MRL showed no blood flow to her brain and four dead areas. There is a go fund me page called &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/miracles-for-mia-klyczek" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Miracles for Mia Klyczek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundraiser, as of Saturday morning, has raised more than $77,000 to help with Mia's medical expenses while she continues to fight her battle.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three people organized the fundraiser on GoFundMe, saying: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sean and Christina are overwhelmed and humbled by the love and support of their family, friends and community. They continue to need our prayers as their beautiful Mia continues to fight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mia went into the ER Wednesday morning, Feb 19th after a slight fever and vomiting. She started seizing and was sedated with a breathing tube to give her body time to heal. She tested positive for Flu B, which they think impacted her heart and later, bleeding in her brain. The swelling in her brain remains severe and the neurologists are continuing to do all they can for this sweet baby.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Their faith in God is strong and they are continuing to pray for a miracle. Many people have reached out asking how to help so some friends wanted to start this page to raise money for future medical bills while Mia continues to fight her battle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Almighty God, I humbly seek Your miraculous touch in every aspect of my life. Let Your divine presence be a beacon of hope and healing."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

But there’s a catch—hepatitis B doesn’t infect mice, making traditional animal testing difficult. “The only animal that gets infected like humans do is the beaver,” says Dr. David, laughing. “And my team wasn’t exactly excited about going out to catch beavers by the river.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3j1si" data-offset-key="60d9l-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="60d9l-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="60d9l-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dr. David has always loved solving puzzles—both literal and scientific. “As a kid, I loved putting together tiny puzzle pieces.

It also won him a Pulitzer Prize. (Additionally, Yong’s 2022 book about animal perception, “&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/22/books/review-immense-world-animal-senses-ed-yong.html" title=""&gt;An Immense World&lt;/a&gt;,” became a best seller. A young reader’s edition will be published on May 13.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But despite having achieved a level of success and attention that most writers can only dream of, Yong’s immersion in Covid left him feeling as utterly depleted as many of the health care professionals and patients he was covering. So much so that in 2023, he decided to leave his prestigious perch at The Atlantic. Since then, in addition to working on a new book, he has found a measure of salvation, even transcendence, in birding, a pastime that he, like so many others, took up in the wake of those grim days of social distancing and time stuck inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So as we approach the fifth anniversary of the U.S. pandemic lockdowns, I wanted to talk with Yong about his Covid lows, his hopeful response to those struggles and his perspective on the lessons we learned — or maybe more accurate, &lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;didn’t &lt;/em&gt;learn &lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;— &lt;/em&gt;from that strange and troubling time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;I want to start with a subject that a lot of people can relate to: burnout. How did you realize that you had given all that you had to give?&lt;/strong&gt; I remember talking to public-health experts for a story and hearing people say that they were feeling depressed, anxious, they couldn’t sleep, and thinking, Man, that feels very familiar. That was in June of 2020. By the middle of 2023, I realized that I was doing my best work at severe cost to all of the other parts of myself. I actually dislike the word “burnout.” It creates this image that the person in question did their job, the job was really hard and after a while they couldn’t stand how hard it was and they stopped doing it. Which I don’t think is correct. A lot of the health care workers I spoke to said that it wasn’t that they couldn’t handle doing their job. It was that they couldn’t handle not &lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;being able&lt;/em&gt; to do their job. They saw all of the institutional and systemic factors that prevented them from providing the care that they wanted to provide. For them, it was more about this idea of moral injury, this massive gulf between what you want the world to be and what you see happening around you. At some point that becomes intolerable. I think that’s much closer to my experience of pandemic journalism too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;Do you have any answers for how to contextualize your feelings in a world where people are struggling for subsistence or with the threat of violence? I often think, when I’ll be low, What right do I have to complain? I’m sure you must have had similar thoughts. &lt;/strong&gt;This is a great point because you don’t even have to go to that extreme of folks who are struggling to get by, folks who are in the middle of war zones. Let’s just talk about the people whose stories I’m trying to tell. What right do I have to say, “I have listened to your stories, and I’m trying to write about them, and that, for me, is too hard”? Doesn’t that sound a little bit pathetic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 10:15:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5mSzAwTk9vYXg1dWRxUXUyMjZJcWR1YTlicWxoazRmRGQxRGtLMUFJLWlydjBFajFvZml1XzBzWV9WeGVJbnVRa1dReU1Wa0tTTGdjd2pHelpIOG9jQVlMcWwyTDZuZWE4ZTRDdVpaODRUUkRq</guid></item><item><title>5 Exercises to Improve Your Balance and Age Well - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTFBPclBjSTZaZmo0UEotZUFwLUotdEhOZk5ibFdMcWNNLXJvMURGdzE4a0t2dWw4M2JHYlBVT2w3ak1GcURHMk1vV2VoVmtoV0NUTVJBZEk1Y3MwNFgxNlF2UEFVb3ZDdjVMYkRPY0VfWmpWekVpbGRFekZiQ19ZQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Falls are the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/falls" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;second-leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of unintentional injury deaths worldwide, worldwide, with people over 60 suffering the highest number. While balance impacts both our longevity and our quality of life, it’s &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/well/move/balance-exercises.html" title=""&gt;an often-neglected skill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/17/975" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;A 2022 study&lt;/a&gt; by a team of Brazilian researchers found that 20 percent of the 1,700 older adults they tested couldn’t balance on one leg for 10 seconds or more. And that inability to balance was associated with a twofold risk of death from any cause within 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“There’s a downward spiral of the people who don’t go out, who don’t walk, who don’t exercise, who don’t do balance training, and they become weaker and weaker,” said Dr. Lewis Lipsitz, a professor of medicine at Harvard University and the director of the Marcus Institute for Aging Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The following workout was originally created as part of &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/well/move/balance-exercises.html" title=""&gt;an article offering a 10-second test&lt;/a&gt; to assess your balance. If you have tried the test (with a wall or chair nearby for safety) and didn’t pass, don’t panic: It’s never too late to start working on balance training. And even if you &lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; pass the 10-second test, it’s important to keep working on your balance, especially if you’re over 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Having a good sense of balance doesn’t have to mean handstands and acrobatics.

He warned Chest pain that feels like pressure, tightness, squeezing, or heaviness in the chest could be a symptom of a heart attack, and it’s essential to dial 999&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; It occurs when fluid builds up in the tissue - a result of a heart that is too&lt;span&gt; weak to pump blood effectively around the body, leading to a build-up in the veins and tissues of the legs and feet.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But less than half (46 per cent) of Brits are aware that this is a symptom of heart disease, a Lloyds Pharmacy survey of 500 Brits revealed.&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 2million people in the UK are diagnosed with some form of heart disease, according to Government figures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But charities estimate that a further six million have undiagnosed high blood pressure - one of the leading risk factors for stroke and heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's often caused by fatty deposits in the arteries that can make it harder for blood and oxygen to flow properly through the vessels and to and from the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This  increases the risk of a blockage, and therefore stroke or heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While some warning signs (pictured) are easy to spot — such as severe chest pain — others are more vague and hard to pinpoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Less than half (46 per cent) were aware that leg swelling, medically known as oedema is a symptom of heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chest pain that feels like pressure, tightness, squeezing, or heaviness in the chest could be a symptom of a heart attack, and it’s essential to dial 999, Dr Shah stressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's the most recognised symptom with 80 per cent of people polled identifying it as a major warning sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shortness of breath is another, which 77 per cent of people know about.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Shah explained that if the heart isn’t pumping enough blood throughout the body, fluid may build up in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Irregular heart rhythms can also be an indication of heart disease, which 70 per cent of people were aware of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although this might not be directly linked to a serious condition, it’s important to get this checked to understand any underlying issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Extreme fatigue that makes day-to-day activities or mild exercise exhausting is another red flag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But just over half (66 per cent) of people surveyed knew to watch out for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;More than 7.6 million people in the UK are living with heart or circulatory diseases, according to the British Heart Foundation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Shah stressed that there are lifestyle factors that we should all be considering to prevent the disease - and one is cutting down on fatty foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Reducing fat intake is an effective way to not only lower your risk of coronary heart disease but also help reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, a high-fibre, low-fat diet is recommended and should include at least five servings of fruit and vegetables, as well as whole grains (oats, rye and brown rice). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS also advises limiting salt intake to no more than 6g per day and avoiding saturated fats, as they can increase cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Staying active can reduce your risk of heart disease by up to 35 per cent, according to the British Heart Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Shah said it regulate your blood pressure and lower your cholesterol, whether walking, cycling, swimming or attending a fitness class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Quitting smoking can also cut the risk of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's because smoking damages the lining of the arteries, including the coronary arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition, a chemical called acrolein interferes with the body’s ability to process cholesterol, leading to higher levels in the bloodstream, Dr Shah warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking alcohol is also a risk factor of heart disease and Dr Shah said regularly going over the 14 units a week limit over 10 years can increase your risk of developing heart disease or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 09:11:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPR283UjhWWm5rTnR6emRPZmtibEhkVGFoejZybW0yZjR2MnpCQy1WeTVaREZlQlR3bHlpbWlRUnJadUlSanZ4MGk5UzZIWHQ1RGlNck8tQnJkdDhnMG56dTZLd1duNV9FalBXUFQxOXlFeXBXUzZGZnZGaFIxWW1VVFlQVVZrbTRuemVpNUlfZnVKdzRINi1ncHBxZUV6ZHlsVGNzeTBB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE8zcVhXVlVFWlVwaGFNVnF4X2RwMnpMNmRNdm1sQWtCQ1VlaXBMWW1RTTBiTkNXWExxelg0Qkprb25ILTQyTHZZZzVNOUJVb3ZrM0lzdEhyTHBWLVRZTkdvNEl2bE5aMFJST3dHRThSYU9rLW5yVldKQ2ZBU1pISTJ1b0lfOGpxZFRiNWwtWk9xM3FjVy1MLVR4UmZkVTRCT2twVlhXUGxWNDN1RQ</guid></item><item><title>Arabia's rainfall was five times more extreme 400 years ago - Phys.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTFBRYV9WaG5pZWRycXptTzFVb212WUI3ZmhwOGY0b1NqbU9XajFuVVo3U2FvTEgwUy1HUGVqNVM0eWc3QUFmRndOM25VZEZ1MUhSQkNlSW85RkZaaU5oRmJaTlZsaXBTZDRkQ296andVRGR3d9IBcEFVX3lxTE1rQmdEU0tMNkxXblJldDFma29jbThHTFBETkdjZkc2MHJNa2podWJqUVJ4cVVGbUFnWWpJeTd3SnJQTnlVRHVERHliRmluLVp1V1YzWTYzQ0F5TENhLURBWTJOZldkRmtNVTVvTWcyVFU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study reconstructing extreme rainfall in Arabia has uncovered that rainfall in the region was five times more extreme just 400 years ago, highlighting the need for preparedness amid growing urbanization.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The findings from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science-led study suggest that the last 2,000 years were much wetter, with the region's climate once resembling a vegetated savannah roaming with lions, leopards, and wolves, unlike its present-day hyper-arid desert. The study was &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adq3173" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Feb. 21 in the journal &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As major development projects like NEOM in Saudi Arabia continue to reshape the landscape, these findings underscore the critical need for enhanced &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/climate+resilience/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;climate resilience&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/disaster+preparedness/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;disaster preparedness&lt;/a&gt; to address the growing threat of extreme weather events in the region," said the study's lead author Sam Purkis, a professor and chair of the Department of Marine Geosciences at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) at over a mile depth deployed from the research vessel &lt;a href="https://oceanx.org/oceanxplorer" target="_blank"&gt;OceanXplorer&lt;/a&gt;, the research team extracted &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/sediment+cores/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sediment cores&lt;/a&gt; from a deep-sea brine pool in the Gulf of Aqaba, an extension of the northern Red Sea. The brine's chemistry preserves undisturbed sediment layers, providing a unique and highly accurate record of Late Holocene rainfall trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;They found that the last 2,000 years in Arabia were much wetter, with the region once a vegetated savannah and about 200 years ago, rainfall was double the current amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a key record to fill in the history of Middle Eastern climate. What it tells us is that the climate, both the average and the extremes, can change dramatically in this region, and the assumption of long-term climate stability in future development is not a good one." said Amy Clement, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Middle East is considered a climate hotspot, with increasing &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/flash+floods/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;flash floods&lt;/a&gt; from torrential winter rains, interspersed by harsh droughts, in Arabia causing widespread chaos and humanitarian disasters. The variability of Late Holocene rainfall highlights the need for better flash flood and drought preparedness and understanding future hydroclimate trends as the Middle East rapidly urbanizes. The &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/catastrophic+flooding/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;catastrophic flooding&lt;/a&gt; across the Arabian Peninsula in the winter of 2024 underscores the urgency of studying the frequency and triggers of such extreme weather events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Utilizing the technology on OceanXplorer in combination with multidisciplinary experts in ocean and climate science we can further our understanding of the linkages between ocean systems and long-term weather and climate trends, to help at-risk areas be ready for the future." said Mattie Rodrigue, science program director at OceanX.&lt;/p&gt;

Suddenly, you feel very nauseous,” Sweat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this virus comes on quickly, it runs through folks pretty fast, too.

It’s a gastrointestinal illness that’s marked by vomiting and diarrhea, according to Kuritzkes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted that people with norovirus “should not have any blood in their diarrhea, unlike some of the bacterial causes of diarrhea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you may experience other ailments that go hand in hand with vomiting and diarrhea, like stomach upset, nausea and cramping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlike colds and the flu, muscle aches and fever are less common in norovirus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It typically doesn’t cause fever, and so it’s not like when you have the flu or COVID, where you’ll have muscle aches and pains and upper respiratory symptoms like a runny nose or anything,” Kuritzkes said. “None of those things are common with norovirus.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, you can still get a fever or aches with norovirus, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the CDC" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7880ee4b0cb1a004cad6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. So if you experience those symptoms along with gastrointestinal issues, you might have the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The virus spreads through contaminated food, water and surfaces.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus can survive on surfaces for multiple weeks, Lokant said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You could acquire the virus after coming in contact with everyday items — this could be contaminated food, contaminated water or contaminated surfaces like doorknobs or smartphones, especially when in close contact with infected individuals,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lokant also noted that infected persons “have the virus in their vomit and stool.” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/causes/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="So, for instance, vomit particles can float through the air" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7880ee4b0cb1a004cad6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/causes/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;So, for instance, vomit particles can float through the air&lt;/a&gt; and end up in a noninfected person’s mouth or on surfaces people frequently touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Outbreaks typically occur among people living in close quarters. That classic scenario would be an outbreak on a cruise ship, but other places to consider would be nursing homes or schools,” Lokant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also common for norovirus to be spread by food handlers, with Lokant adding, “Foods commonly involved in outbreaks include leafy greens, fresh fruits and shellfish,” while Kuritzkes noted that raw oysters from Washington state and Oregon “have been implicated in some of the current outbreaks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: RealPeopleGroup via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;RealPeopleGroup via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Thorough hand washing with soap and water can keep you from getting sick with norovirus.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norovirus is very contagious. Some of our standard hygiene methods don’t work against it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While alcohol-based hand sanitizers can kill viruses like &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/coronavirus" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="COVID-19" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7880ee4b0cb1a004cad6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/topic/coronavirus" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, that is not the case for norovirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The norovirus actually has a protective outer shell, making alcohol-based hand sanitizers less effective than hand washing,” Lokant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Sweat, the key is to wash your hands carefully for 20 seconds and to disinfect any contaminated or potentially contaminated surfaces with a bleach-based solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also recommended avoiding touching your face while you’re out because “that’s how it typically would be spread. You might touch a surface and then rub your nose or your eyes, and then you can get infected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Sweat noted that if you’re taking care of someone with norovirus, you should wear disposable gloves and a mask when cleaning up after them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you get sick, hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main thing is to do your best to stay hydrated,” Kuritzkes said in regard to potentially contracting the norovirus. He suggested drinks like Gatorade or Pedialyte, which will replace the fluids and electrolytes you lose. It’s also important to minimize “solid foods or dairy-containing foods, which are going to be harder to digest,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the only other main action you can take is to let the virus ride its course. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no vaccine and there’s no specific antiviral therapy, so it really is just supportive care, which is essentially fluid replacement,” Kuritzkes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people recover in one to three days, but the elderly, immunocompromised folks and young children are at risk of severe complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Older people may have other medical conditions where becoming dehydrated may carry additional risks because of poor circulation or heart disease,” Kuritzkes said. “If you are unable to keep liquids down, and particularly if you’re starting to feel lightheaded or lethargic, that could be a sign of dehydration, and that would be a reason to seek medical attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional signs of dehydration include dark urine and dry lips, Sweat noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re sick, you should isolate and avoid preparing food for other people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there’s anybody in the household who has symptoms of norovirus, they should not be preparing food for others,” Kuritzkes said. “And then, if somebody has those symptoms, they, of course, should stay home from work until they resolve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, folks should isolate from other people until they’re feeling well again, Sweat said. But even once you feel better, you can spread the virus for multiple weeks, Lokant warned. This is particularly true for immunocompromised people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do get sick with norovirus this season, you should stay away from others for at least two to three days after your symptoms go away, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20355296" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the Mayo Clinic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b7880ee4b0cb1a004cad6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/norovirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20355296" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;according to the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.

                          &lt;p&gt;"Biological age essentially tells you how fast your body is aging," she said. "A lower biological age tells me your training and lifestyle habits are well-rounded."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the three areas of fitness she works on with clients to lower their biological ages and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-expert-doctor-bare-minimum-tips-to-live-longer-2024-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;improve their longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="fc8770ee-ce6c-433a-916f-7a7c3b2b9c79" data-toc-id="fc8770ee-ce6c-433a-916f-7a7c3b2b9c79"&gt;1) Improve mobility and range of motion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a client is mostly &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/daily-exercise-prevent-death-sitting-all-day-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;sedentary&lt;/a&gt;, McKenzie starts off "slow and steady," and works on helping them do day-to-day movements as easily as possible, including grabbing things from overhead, getting up from a chair, and walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also looks at clients' form to ensure they aren't putting extra stress on their joints when exercising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to get people to a place where it's hard for them to practice bad form because their bodies have become so accustomed to moving the way they're supposed to," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="f10ad1fc-d748-431b-b1f2-cad126509c82" data-toc-id="f10ad1fc-d748-431b-b1f2-cad126509c82"&gt;2) Do progressively harder strength training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One 2022 review of research, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, found that for healthy adults, 30 to 60 minutes a week of muscle-strengthening activity was associated with a 10-17% lower risk of dying from chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/accepting-type-1-diabetes-insulin-shots-dinner-table-2024-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

She has since lost at least 30 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She cautioned that anyone considering the medications ‘must always go through a real doctor, though who knows what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Research is everything.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many people eager to try the groundbreaking obesity medicine find that their insurance plans will not cover the cost, which can be a high $1,200 per month. In that instance, they often shift to online prescribing platforms involving a brief medical professional consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medication typically comes from a compounding pharmacy, where pharmacists hand-mix it using its main ingredients. The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/fda/index.html" id="mol-0b494a00-f07f-11ef-8c8b-d5801fca125c" class=""&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; does not regulate this practice, so disingenuous or inattentive practitioners may use faulty ingredients or incorrect dosages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;2024 vs 2018: The 53-year-old reality star has shed more than 20 lbs thanks to the drug Mounjaro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Catania told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/811942/rhonj-dolores-catania-gets-real-about-the-menopause-and-marriage/"&gt;Hello!&lt;/a&gt; that the medicine has been ‘a life changer’ for her and her boyfriend Paul Connell, who has lost 60 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘He no longer takes a certain blood pressure medication, and it's been really positive. There are side effects like nausea, but you take a pill for that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clinical trials found that people taking Mounjaro could expect to lose around 15 to 20 percent of their body weight over roughly 72 weeks. The drug works best when taken with a healthy diet and exercise regimen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Catania shared that she used to be ‘a big carb person.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was Doritos, chips, onion dip. Now, it makes me nauseous. I absolutely don't eat that anymore.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She and her boyfriend also work out three to four times a week and while it can be hard to get herself moving, she said, ‘It's starting to feel good to me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic was designed and approved to treat type 2 diabetes but has been &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12111857/Pfizers-diabetes-drug-results-similar-weight-loss-levels-Novos-Ozempic.html"&gt;prescribed off-label for obesity for years&lt;/a&gt;. Mounjaro was approved to do the same but was similarly prescribed to spur weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Much loved by celebrities, the drugs hit protracted shortages until just last autumn because people who would not necessarily benefit medically were snapping up supplies as soon as they became available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mounjaro contains the active ingredient tirzepatide that mimics hormones in the brain responsible for regulating appetite and feelings of fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To many body positivity influencers, the drugs’ meteoric rise in popularity reversed a slow, years-long societal shift toward body acceptance. It also sparked anger toward celebrities for what many saw as jumping on the thinness bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Catania said: ‘I kind of think I broke the seal on being honest about it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was also quick to tell people that, rather than taking the medicine for vanity reasons, she had a medical need for it: ‘I'm going through menopause, I have a thyroid issue, I have inflammation and weight is hard to take off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I work out, and I don't eat crazy, and I was gaining weight, and it's a lot of different layers.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors often warn people that these medications are highly effective tools for weight management, but they are not a magic bullet for obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Amy Lee, chief medical officer at Lindora Clinic, a weight management company in Southern California, said: ‘You will acquire the symptoms of hunger and cravings that you had before starting the medication. Your body will return to the “baseline.”’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 study tracked 670 people taking tirzepatide for 36 weeks.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Afterward, half of the participants continued taking a high dose of tirzepatide for another year, while the other half received a placebo injection. Both groups also received lifestyle counseling, focusing on reduced calorie intake and regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The group that continued tirzepatide lost an additional 5.5 percent of their body weight on average, while those who switched to the placebo regained 14 percent of their weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The placebo group also showed increased cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure levels compared to when they were on tirzepatide, according to Dr. Louis Aronne, the study's lead author and director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 06:45:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQNEhBb1lMRm15M0NoVllxSk5TbFBCX2dVSXlXOXo2bkoyQzdNcTE3dzM1V3RUc2U1Q3NCUGwtUTU5X19TdUEyN0tKRHJMeGFNcEZNX2lpd3BaVUFTQWlQOEotUlhIc0N5Z1gyT2hBd3RqWXltVzFNdnFFMnJqNFcwYXpoMGZRSXNzMnpOd2twYXRCdXdUcVhaTXBJcU9ZaDJvUXhJNkRR0gGrAUFVX3lxTE02RE9OOEpjdXBOdC1KUmRjcnNxRUNCY2tWYVZwQjdkYVlkZ21IV3JPYm1SQ1g5a2xoV2hmVFdqWjhTNXRJTjVUY3Fyb0hYRnV3ME5CZ0w3U1RFM1M0YUd0bjhwZS1RU29EWEk4WEhhdkZ3OGtwcUkwNWJMM3BodzdqS0pOU3IxSjYwd09ZR0ZIbmFNemhJeE04S1BDMTVOZzZmVHJEUnFmUW1iMA</guid></item><item><title>Yale scientists who risked careers to publish bombshell Covid vaccine study issue message to shot's victims - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOSEMtcEtVMDQ5aTVCZUo0LW9COFVkNWFob2NjVHZnaG1Nc2lSYnVMTHFjTEVSMVJMTDhpdlhtZjQxSjZlTEJIRjJ2ajZfRXdnVmJETVRzUzFsYV9hMnA0cW1YYlh0MG1fek1Zbmo4ZkdRTndLbldUZmlrNmtwUnRJOVB0MnMtOWc1UzJlWW5sdmJtR0Eyd2NCVkJQMWNBbHB3V2ZETXBtMk4zV0pC0gGyAUFVX3lxTE1JcFN1S3A4NHRlX1dtNWlBTjhDQ0txbUJPT0luaWRtM0x6YUpQMkE4YjlzQjExTWlWRkpQQlotNEhhQXBLNUtQMjBLMVZpbF9rZHdoQ0s4Q2dQeEx6dEk3Rm1jbFNZNmNFMUdYQU50eURUdy1yV0FNVW1CZERGQTJ4T0Q4UVhaZ040NWROUV9uNkJzU196dUxHZ1VINHdhN2ZyRVl5c01Cb2dlRlBBQUhmblE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Akiko Iwasaki is one of the lead Yale University experts researching 'post-vaccination syndrome' following Covid vaccines.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We would like to expand our research to a larger cohort and validate our current findings,' she said. 'We need funding to carry out such future work.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC still &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-10161467/Veterans-not-vaccinated-said-worried-effects-newness-shots.html"&gt;recommends Covid vaccines, especially for those who are elderly or immunocompromised and vulnerable to the disease.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid is also still &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-8239461/Confirmed-coronavirus-cases-surpass-800-000-death-toll-hits-42-940.html"&gt;killing about 300 Americans every week&lt;/a&gt;, CDC data shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the new research, DailyMail.com spoke with dozens of Americans who report being injured from the vaccines and have expressed hope that their symptoms are being validated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of them was Kari Ponce de Leon, a 43-year-old mother from Montana who decided to get the Pfizer Covid vaccine in February 2021 out of a sense of duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, what she thought was a good deed turned into a years-long ordeal with dangerous blood conditions that could have caused deadly bleeding.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-two told DailyMail.com: 'I thought that I was doing the right thing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She stressed that while she's not anti-vaccine and has 'had all the vaccines that I can,' she does feel the government abandoned her after mandating the shot. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I've never had a problem before.

In a 2017 study, patients who took high doses of sulforaphane had much lower blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research involved 89 individuals with elevated fasting blood sugar, a key marker of prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were also had either overweight or obesity and were between the ages of 35 and 75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 12 weeks, the participants were randomly assigned either sulforaphane or a placebo, with neither the researchers nor the participants knowing who received which treatment. In total, 74 participants successfully completed all stages of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study found that participants who took the sulforaphane compound experienced a greater average reduction in fasting blood sugar levels compared to those who received the placebo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between the two groups was significant. An even more pronounced effect was observed when examining specific clinical subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest improvements were seen in individuals with early signs of mild age-related diabetes, a relatively lower BMI within the study’s context, low insulin resistance, a low prevalence of fatty liver disease, and lower insulin secretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior researcher &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/research/anders-rosengren" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Anders Rosengren, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, from the University of Gothenburg explained the key findings to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;. He told us:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have found that sulforaphane, a compound that is highly contained in cruciferous vegatables such as broccoli, reduces blood glucose in individuals with prediabetes, i.e. a pre-stage of type 2 diabetes. In early stages of diabetes, the glucose production from the liver is increased. Sulforaphane interferes specifically with increased glucose production and reduces it. By doing that, fasting blood glucose is kept at lower levels, which is beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also found that a subgroup of people with mild obesity and well-preserved insulin secretion has even larger effect,” Rosengren added. “Moreover, we found that individuals who have high abundance of a specific gut microbe that converts the inactive precursor to active sulforaphane have increased effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens an avenue for precision treatment of prediabetes to those who benefit most,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third part of the study, researchers also studied gut bacteria. They found a specific type of bacteria that interacts with sulforaphane and seems to make it more effective at lowering blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, people who took sulforaphane had fasting blood sugar levels that were 0.2 millimoles per litre lower than those who took a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a specific group of participants — individuals with mild obesity, low insulin resistance and reduced insulin secretion — the difference was of 0.4 millimoles per litre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest drop, 0.7 millimoles per litre, occurred in people who were part of that group and also had a particular gut bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prediabetes is estimated to affect 5-10% of the adult population,” Rosengren explained. “Most people don’t know about their condition but it can be suspected if you have relatives with type 2 diabetes, eat unhealthily and have limited exercise and high BMI [body mass index].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lifestyle changes is a cornerstone but we also need additional complements. Sulforaphane can be provided as a functional food and thereby open up a new form of treatment for prediabetes. It is difficult to eat pure broccoli to reach the levels used in our study (you would need several kilograms per day) but it can be achieved by broccoli sprout extracts. As a consumer you have to be careful as the content of sulforaphane vary widely in marketed products. We used [a tool called] &lt;a href="http://diaopt.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Diaopt&lt;/a&gt; in order to achieve the proper amounts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Anders Rosengren, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rutsunutrition.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Haley Bishoff, RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, a plant-based registered dietitian and owner of Rūtsu Nutrition in Las Vegas, not involved in this research told MNT that “sulforaphane is a powerful plant compound in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli,” and that “it is well known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cancer-fighting properties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The [current] research showed potential with broccoli sprout extract and its ability to help lower blood sugar levels. However, the most benefit was seen in people who already had low insulin resistance and healthy gut microbes,” Bishoff explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First and foremost, it’s important to understand that prediabetes is often preventable and reversible,” Bishoff explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many medical professionals are focused on treatment with medication, versus prevention as a primary approach. People with a healthy gut microbiome also tend to respond better to diabetic medications and see improved blood sugar control, compared to those who do not. This is another great reason to always prioritize a healthy lifestyle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Haley Bishoff, RDN, LD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An imbalance in healthy gut bacteria can contribute to elevated blood sugar and insulin resistance,” she added. “To maintain a healthy gut, it’s important to reduce eating ultra-processed foods, refined carbohydrates and high saturated fat foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eating a diet rich in prebiotic fiber, fermented foods and food in its natural form will help maintain an overall healthier gut microbiome,” Bishoff advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/weight-loss-nutritionists#courtney-pelitera" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Courtney Pelitera, MS, RD, CNSC&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian specializing in sports nutrition and wellness nutrition, also not involved in the study, said that “overall, the study shows that the [broccoli sprout extract] did not benefit blood glucose levels as much as originally predicted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, it did help to reveal that the health of the gut microbiome correlates with effective blood glucose control. Those that had a healthier gut microbiome were more likely to benefit from the [broccoli sprout extract] with a more effective fasting glucose response,” she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study could have bigger implications later on when we have more research in identifying exactly who will benefit from broccoli sprout extract as a treatment for prediabetes. “I think in my own practice, I would use this information to encourage patients to focus on having a healthy gut microbiome,” Pelitera explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can do this by including a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in the diet along with whole grains. This helps to provide both soluble and insoluble fiber and prebiotics, aiding in the improvement of the microbiome. Also, including [fermented] foods, such a yogurt, kombucha, kimchi, pickled foods, and cheeses adds probiotics and probiotics coming from whole foods into the gut microbiome. I would encourage adding these types of foods into the daily diet before supplementing the broccoli sprout extract.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Courtney Pelitera, MS, RD, CNSC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 06:33:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxOSW5aNk5TOUFtcnhpbGVCemsxT1NaZEl5S09DR1ZuRm1OQllEOXVwY1lPTU93aTdreUt3ZldUU2FycVd5ZEpwdFo1NGlrbXEyTEx2VzhJclZ3aGxDNjB4TmxYcHFqNXc4allBSndMd0NXcTdyOEQwdXlRcW5od1J6bGhsMDlMeVM5UjBES25iMHNucFBzQWVN</guid></item><item><title>7 best workouts for longevity and anti-aging - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longevity is a tricky term. It’s not just about genetics or a stroke of good luck; it’s all about balance. Many things come to mind when we speak about longevity. One would be the brain and its cognitive prowess. Then we have the heart, which is the number one killer, followed by cancer and metabolic diseases like diabetes. These metabolic diseases essentially wreak havoc on your body at a systemic level. An overload of blood glucose can reach toxic levels, thereby damaging all cells in its reach. It’s a silent killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Asad Hussain, Founder and CEO of OddsFitnes, “Longevity is all about balance. This is a curious statement as it explains why the longest-living individuals lead the most balanced lives. Their existence isn’t tilted in pursuit of anything extreme. While there are exceptions, statistically, longevity appears to be a direct reflection of balance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first and foremost disease that most Indians encounter is diabetes, and to help deal with it, strength training is highly recommended. Strength training not only enhances your ability to store glucose within muscle cells because of increased muscle mass (hypertrophy), where it is stored as glycogen but also makes cells more receptive to receiving glucose (by enhancing GLUT4 sensitivity) and disposing of it through anaerobic glycolysis (the mechanism involved in breaking down glucose for energy). This prevents the cells from being exposed to excess glucose, which should not exceed 240 mg/dL for prolonged periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does this prevent cell damage, but it also reduces the risks of all the other diseases mentioned. It is recommended atleast three 30-40-minute sessions per week of strength training. Just one session is enough to reduce HbA1c by 1.1-1.3 percent over three months without any other interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Divya Sakhalkar from OddsFitness elaborates: “Think of glycation as caramelizing your body from the inside out. Cutting down on sugar and moving more can help prevent it. Oxidative stress and glycation accelerate aging unnecessarily, but exercising correctly and eating smarter are the best anti-aging remedies. Imagine your body ‘rusting’ from the inside - exercise keeps it polished and running like new. Too much sugar gums up your cells and makes you age faster, but exercise helps clean up the mess. Strength training is your best defense against glycation. Your body is like a machine—too much sugar clogs the system, but movement keeps it running smoothly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cardiovascular diseases, most people assume that a heart attack is a sudden and acute event that probably happens due to bad luck or factors outside our control. However, cardiovascular disease can literally begin at the young age of 20, taking decades until your coronary arteries (which supply blood to the heart) start getting blocked. Exercise, especially cardiovascular exercise, not only ensures that you have healthy blood vessels but also helps the heart develop an enhanced cardiac output. Endurance-based exercises increase left ventricular volume, reducing the number of times the heart needs to contract by increasing stroke volume. A healthier heart and healthier blood vessels can be achieved through cardiovascular exercises, and 150 minutes of zone 2 (120 beats per minute) cardio per week can be divided into three 50-minute sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, cancer, which many attribute to bad luck, is a misunderstood disease. Having great metabolic health, a lower inflammatory state, a robust immune system, and a healthy lifestyle in general—all of which can be achieved through exercise—can help prevent and also increase the chances of survival from this disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the study say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the NIH (National Cancer Institute), excess body fat, especially visceral fat, increases inflammation in the body and creates hormone dysregulation, both of which create an environment that increases the risk of 13 different types of cancer. When it comes to cancer, exercising not only helps regulate body composition, but it also improves immunity, which helps inhibit tumor growth. Exercise enhances mitochondrial health, which boosts metabolic flexibility, allowing cells to efficiently switch between fuel sources. This optimized metabolism minimizes the excessive accumulation of biosynthetic intermediates and reactive byproducts that, if elevated, could create an environment conducive to cancer cell growth. By practicing a well-rounded fitness routine, you can ensure not only the prevention of cancer but also reduce the risk of death due to cancer cachexia, which now accounts for 20-30 percent of cancer-related deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer cachexia is a condition where a person loses weight drastically, especially muscle mass, wreaking havoc on the metabolic and mechanical functions. It is highly recommended to exercise to maintain healthy body composition. A well-rounded fitness routine that includes at least 100 minutes of cardio-based exercises, zone 4 (threshold training) to enhance vasculature and oxygen delivery, three days a week of strength training (to build muscle reserve and improve metabolic health), and two days a week of yoga (for mindfulness and a regulated autonomic nervous system) is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, regarding the brain and cognition, all the above-mentioned modalities help with brain vasculature, health, and size. Engaging in racket sports stimulates decision-making and critical thinking, thereby keeping the brain active.

The virus was first detected in the Japanese pipistrelle bat species in Hong Kong and has now been found to have the ability to bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors—the same receptors used by SARS-CoV-2 for infection. According to the study, which was published in the peer-reviewed journal Cell, the virus can also attach to ACE2 receptors in other mammalian species, increasing the possibility of cross-species transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is HKU5-CoV-2 similar to SARS-CoV-2?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of HKU5-CoV-2 is concerning due to its similarities to SARS-CoV-2, as both viruses rely on ACE2 receptors to enter human cells. However, researchers highlight that HKU5-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 receptors far less efficiently than SARS-CoV-2, reducing the risk of widespread human transmission. Laboratory tests confirm that while HKU5-CoV-2 can infect human cells and lung tissues, its capacity to spread quickly among humans is significantly weaker than that of SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#News#href" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/us-news-donald-trump-removes-iconic-145-year-old-resolute-desk-days-after-elon-musk-son-visited-oval-office-heres-why/articleshow/118447080.cms" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;Trump removes iconic 145-year old resolute desk days after Elon Musk, son visited Oval Office.

Researchers emphasize that the likelihood of HKU5-CoV-2 causing a human epidemic is lower than that of COVID-19. While the study recognizes that bat coronaviruses present a potential spillover risk, not all animal coronaviruses successfully transmit to humans.

As great as it is to have food standing by whenever you need it, there are also dangers lurking in that chilly appliance. Is there bacteria brewing in three-day-old cooked rice? Or on the fresh salad greens?

First, it’s important to understand your level of risk. “The truth is, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; food can potentially cause food poisoning,” said Dr. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.treated.com%2Fclinical-team%2Fdr-daniel-atkinson&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daniel Atkinson;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Daniel Atkinson&lt;/a&gt;, clinical lead at Treated.com, an online health care service company. “Food that’s been left out too long, has been kept in the fridge past its use-by date or leftovers that aren’t reheated properly can all be contaminated with harmful bacteria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be careful with high-protein foods, fresh vegetables and cooked rice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close-up of a plate of fried rice with vegetables, including peas and carrots, promoting a savory and colorful dish for a food article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are general categories of food that deserve extra care in their storage. If you’re looking for the most likely culprits, “Think of those high-protein foods that pathogens love, like meat, fish, milk, cheese and eggs,” said &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fmatt-taylor-cp-fs-cenvh-fcieh-cert-iosh-76247b34%2F%3Ftrk%3Dorganization_guest_main-feed-card-text&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Matt Taylor;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Matt Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, senior manager of food consulting at the NSF, a nonprofit organization that develops and certifies standards for food safety and sanitation.

He also said that pathogens can contaminate fresh produce, including mushrooms, leafy green prepackaged salads and sprouts. “Most fresh produce should be washed and scrubbed with a produce brush at home,” he said. “Just remember to clean and sanitize the scrubbing brush.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another possible danger comes in cooked rice, which Atkinson explained: “Before it’s even cooked, rice can contain spores of a bacteria known as &lt;em&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/em&gt;,” he said&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;This bacteria can still pose a threat after rice has been cooked, and the risk of becoming ill from eating it is much higher if cooked rice isn’t handled the right way.” He warned that rice should never sit out on a countertop at room temperature. “Refrigerate rice as soon as it’s cooled down, and eat it within 24 hours. One misconception might be that rice that’s unsafe to eat will show visible signs of being off, such as being moldy or having an unusual smell. But this might not always be the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And, he said, you need to be just as cautious with takeout rice, which might have even more potential to do harm. “Additives and spices in fast-food rice might mask signs that it needs discarding, and there’s no way of knowing how long it was stored before being cooked to order,” he said. “For this reason, you should probably avoid putting it in your refrigerator altogether and toss it out when the meal is over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sight and smell can’t always save you (nor can refrigeration).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person sniffing a carton from an open refrigerator, wrinkling their nose, possibly due to a questionable smell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you think you’ll be able to use your senses to uncover food dangers, that may not necessarily be the case, the experts said. “Don’t believe that if it smells good, it’s safe to eat,” said registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.holyname.org%2Fnutrition%2Fstaff.aspx&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tracee Yablon Brenner;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Tracee Yablon Brenner&lt;/a&gt;. “Actually, a good deal of harmful bacteria, such as salmonella and listeria, don’t influence the smell, taste or appearance of food.

But to prevent future food waste, he had this handy idea: “Keep a roll of painter’s tape and a permanent marker in your kitchen, so you can easily label items with names and dates when you store them. Always review food labels for expiration and ‘best by’ dates, as well as serving and safe storage directions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If you’re serious about avoiding getting sick from the food you eat, it always makes sense to make practical decisions,” Atkinson said. “The old adage ‘if in doubt, throw it out’ is a solid rule of thumb when it comes to food safety, and while it might feel wasteful at times to throw out food that’s suspect, you’ll feel better knowing you’re taking fewer risks.”&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fjuliekendrick%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fmost-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator_l_67ab657de4b0c52db9aac4c3&amp;amp;xcust=7834414%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 04:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQMkU1bEl0ZUZpWGxwNTNKTk4ydTRVUDA4czIyMTBDREFIRWdiT2ItcEhRRkQ1akphVlQ2ZFhaVk9xVXUzeGR3LTRUeXR2WE1MRDdUQ2phVEtlS1RLTFpFTEF4MlFZS3pLN2k0bkhZT1czblEtYlJ3WExOTUVOOWxDNnFzWWsxSlNxTE5ha0JPN3lGUTM4</guid></item><item><title>Dementia risk can be reduced with one simple habit experts say is most important you can do - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOSzJnbThucEhlQkpYS0pvRFNhX2c4MFhZNnZYZGZtS1d3QS1xUGJ0NGVtcDhkZHVjSHl1ODdtZldJYlo1RW92YWxVTnpwaHhBX1ZGRVhNdVhQdTRadTRISFhjSHFIcjNpaHo0REFFaTd0U192VXZVZjFfQWhURXZXcGdJVELSAYoBQVVfeXFMT0E1WGhUbkRPYXhxdmRFLTZlMEs3N0RfaXlaLTItT3Fza1NHX2l5NlU4bVYzd09vdXVxbzZzN0dQcC1oWXpTRi1VUFFHVnlrTnM2YV9FLTBtcUNJRWVheUFkT1VzZU9palVNRlBvUDRKanZXSHU2SG1nVW5qbHIzLU8tNmN0OERaS2J3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are nearly 1 million people in the UK with dementia, according to latest estimates, and that is expected to rise to 1.4 million by 2040. It mainly affects people over 65, though that's not to say it's impossible younger people won't also develop it. In fact, there have been many high profile cases recently of sports stars, especially rugby stars, developing the illness, thought to be because of repeated heavy blows to the head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But scientists do not believe that dementia is an inevitability of getting older, and there are things you can do to lower your risk of developing it. The two main things, broadly speaking, are exercise and a healthy diet. But before we get into that, let's look at what causes dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What causes dementia?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dementia is not a single disease and there are different diseases that can cause it. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia. Alzheimer's is thought to be caused by the abnormal build-up of 2 protein deposits which form "tangles" within brain cells, though scientists still do not fully understand this process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vascular dementia is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, which damages and eventually kills brain cells. This can happen as a result of a stroke, where the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly cut off, or lots of "mini strokes" that cause tiny but widespread damage to the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; There are also other kinds of dementia, including frontotemporal dementia, which is most often diagnosed between the ages of 45 and 65 and is caused by an abnormal clumping of proteins in the frontal and temporal lobes at the front and sides of the brain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What increases chances of dementia?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; "Studies show an association between all types of dementia and sedentary behavior," Jigar Rathod MD, a neurologist at Memorial Hermann Mischer Neuroscience Associates, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-break-to-reduce-dementia-risk-11682107" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;told eatingwell.com&lt;/a&gt;, though he added that "a definitive correlating causal risk has not been determined". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it is known that sitting or doing little movement for a prolonged period of time uninterrupted can lead to decreased blood flow in the brain: "Sedentary behavior reduces blood flow to the brain, increases the risk of cardiovascular and related diseases (diabetes, hypertension, obesity), causes brain structure changes, and increases inflammation and insulin resistance," Verna R. Porter MD, a board-certified neurologist and director of Dementia, Alzheimer’s Disease and Neurocognitive Disorders at Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in California, told the same publication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How to reduce chances of dementia&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are risk factors to many illnesses, including dementia, that you can't do anything about, mainly age, family history and genetics. However, there are things you can do to lessen your chances of getting them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take breaks from sitting down&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If a sedentary lifestyle is one of the main factors for increasing your risk of developing dementia, then clearly one of the most important things you can do is try to be less sedentary. To put it another way, sit down less or take breaks from sitting down. This doesn't mean you have to go out and run long distances. Small amounts of walking, and even household chores and walking up and down the stairs, count. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A sedentary lifestyle leads to decreased cerebral blood flow, increasing the risk of neurodegeneration. Physical activity, on the other hand, enhances circulation, which delivers oxygen and nutrients essential for brain health," said Dr Porter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exercise one part of the body in particular&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Dr Dean Sherzai, a neurologist and co-director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Program at Loma Linda University in California, recently told the Zoe podcast that &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/one-exercise-slashes-risk-dementia-30908722" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;exercise was "tremendously important for the brain"&lt;/a&gt;. But he then focused on one particularly important part of the body to exercise: the legs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He said: "It seems that for a long period of time we thought that walking and running — which is phenomenal and walking is amazing, running is great if people want to do it — but building muscle specifically makes a huge difference. Because we have the largest groups of muscles in our legs below our belt,activating those muscles can create more of these growth hormones that Dean was talking about, specifically brain-derived neurotrophic factor. So doing things like squats and lunges, and sometimes we joke and say 'bigger legs, bigger brain'. That could be a title for a really nice book. But really focusing on our glutes and our hamstrings and our quads is incredibly healthy for the brain." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improve your diet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Diet is also important, though scientists caution that the links between nutrients, dietary patterns, and dementia are still being researched. However, they believe that eating healthier diets reduces your risk. In particular, one diet, called the MIND diet, &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/one-diet-slashes-risk-dementia-30907191" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;has been said to reduce your risk of dementia by a staggering 53%&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay. It combines two proven diets – the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet – but focuses even more on foods known to boost brain health and reduce the risk of cognitive decline. This means a plant-focused diet particularly focused on green leafy vegetables, nuts, berries and whole grains, while limiting unhealthy foods such as red meats, butter, sweets and fried or fast foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Play brain-stimulating games with other people&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Cognitive games, crossword puzzles, word searches and games on the computer/phone are helpful for reducing dementia risk. Board games are also of great benefit as they allow social interaction,” said Dr Rathod. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid smoking and reduce alcohol intake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Smoking damages blood vessels, leading to reduced oxygen flow to the brain, while excessive alcohol accelerates cognitive decline and has neurotoxic properties,” said Dr Porter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOSzJnbThucEhlQkpYS0pvRFNhX2c4MFhZNnZYZGZtS1d3QS1xUGJ0NGVtcDhkZHVjSHl1ODdtZldJYlo1RW92YWxVTnpwaHhBX1ZGRVhNdVhQdTRadTRISFhjSHFIcjNpaHo0REFFaTd0U192VXZVZjFfQWhURXZXcGdJVELSAYoBQVVfeXFMT0E1WGhUbkRPYXhxdmRFLTZlMEs3N0RfaXlaLTItT3Fza1NHX2l5NlU4bVYzd09vdXVxbzZzN0dQcC1oWXpTRi1VUFFHVnlrTnM2YV9FLTBtcUNJRWVheUFkT1VzZU9palVNRlBvUDRKanZXSHU2SG1nVW5qbHIzLU8tNmN0OERaS2J3</guid></item><item><title>Ohio has reported its first pediatric flu death of the season.

"We urge parents to protect their kids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu activity typically peaks sometime between December and February, but ODH is reporting that current activity remains "very high." Hospitalizations this flu season have also been "well above" the five-year average for this time in the season, ODH said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learn what doctors are telling parents below:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;
    
        &lt;p class="VideoEnhancement-title"&gt;Ohio reports its first pediatric flu death of the season. What you should know&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
        
    
    
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the start of this flu season, Ohio has seen more than 9,000 flu-related hospitalizations. Hamilton County has had the second-highest number of hospitalizations in the state, with 539. Many of those have been children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you haven’t gotten your flu vaccine this year, get your flu vaccine," said Dr. Chris Peltier, a pediatrician at Pediatrics Associates of Mt. Carmel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peltier said one of the reasons we've seen more hospitalizations this flu season is due to the current strain: "(It's) more severe than ... other strains have been in past years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the most common reason for hospitalizations is the development of a second infection in the lungs, causing trouble breathing. But some complications are a bit rarer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Northern Kentucky family took their 5-year-old son Benjamin to Cincinnati Children's after he was unable to walk after testing positive for the flu. There, doctors diagnosed him with viral myositis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It essentially causes inflammation that causes some breakdown of the muscles … and unfortunately the only treatment for that is really sort of aggressive IV fluid, rehydration, and time," Peltier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benjamin's family told us since getting his diagnosis, he is about 90% recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peltier said if anyone in the family gets sick, remember to stay hydrated. If you think you may need to go to the hospital, he recommends calling your primary care physician first. &lt;/p&gt;

or Alzheimer’s disease, leading researchers to think he had not inherited the &lt;em&gt;PSEN2&lt;/em&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When scientists found out Whitney had inherited the gene, he earned the title of “escapee” or “exceptional resilience mutation carrier” where something in his body was stopping the &lt;em&gt;PSEN2&lt;/em&gt; mutation from taking effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Via brain scans, Llibre-Guerra and his team observed that while Whitney had high levels of amyloid protein in his brain, he only had a localized concentration of the protein tau.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/what-happens-brain-alzheimers-disease" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tau build-up;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tau build-up&lt;/a&gt; in the brain is associated with Alzheimer’s disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This unusual pattern might be indicative of protective mechanisms at play that prevent the widespread tau deposition usually associated with cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s, thus preserving his cognitive functions longer than expected,” Llibre-Guerra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More research needed to determine mechanism behind Alzheimer’s ‘escape’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, Llibre-Guerra said they are not yet sure what might be allowing Whitney to be an Alzheimer’s “escapee,” but they do have a hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It might be more a combination of factors rather than a single one,” he detailed. “From the current data, it might be that a combination of genetic factors, possibly novel protective genetic variants, environmental influences, protein expression, and inflammatory response might induce protective responses in his brain and contribute to resilience against typical Alzheimer’s progression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The study’s findings could potentially lead to new therapeutic targets, especially in understanding and manipulating the factors that limit tau pathology spread and amyloid toxicity,” Llibre-Guerra continued.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying how certain proteins and genetic variants contribute to this protective effect could open up new avenues for drug development aimed at mimicking these natural defenses in broader populations,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More research needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT &lt;/em&gt;had the opportunity to speak with &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/neurology/ca/santa-monica/clifford-segil-1457556581" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil, DO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, about this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results of this study are challenging to believe, as they highlight tau was found only in [the] patient’s &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK544320/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:occipital lobes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;occipital lobes&lt;/a&gt;, which would cause a patient to have visual complaints,” Segil said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If tau pathology was noted in patients’ occipital regions and this study’s participant was without visual complaints, there would be no expectation tau in the other parts of the brain would cause symptoms if this patient had occipital tau without visual complaints,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Segils’s view as a neurologist, ”it is awkward for the authors to say that because this carrier was without spread of tau pathology outside of the occipital region he was without cognitive sides when he had occipital tau pathology and was without visual complaints one would expect from occipital dysfunction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study actually supports that tau pathology remains unclear for any disease outside of tangles being well known to affect &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320601" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parkinsonism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parkinsonism&lt;/a&gt;,” he pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would like to see if the blocking of tau-deposition, which is well established to be related to movement disorders like Parkinsonism, more than Alzheimer’s Dementia, could be a therapeutic intervention for patients with movement disorders more than memory loss, or be used to treat &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323396" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parkinson’s disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;

Women’s Hospital Long Beach and MemorialCare Long Beach Medical Center in California, about this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is remarkable that someone with an inherited mutation that is known to cause early onset Alzheimer’s disease shows no sign of illness at age 75,” Dao commented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This just shows that even though we have identified key genes of Alzheimer’s disease that can predict with high accuracy the disease risk and age of onset of Alzheimer’s disease, there are potential genetic and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36171657/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:proteomic markers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;proteomic markers&lt;/a&gt;

These findings can then be applied to the more common form, late- onset Alzheimer’s disease to help slow progression earlier on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study has identified protective genetic variants to resist the development and progression of DIAD, more studies need to be done to understand the underlying mechanisms,” Dao added. “Specifically, how do these variants restrict pathological tau spread? Understanding this can lead to development of novel therapeutic target treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;View the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-one-mans-escape-from-alzheimers-might-tell-us-about-the-disease/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medical News Today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 00:39:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE9oWkYxdXZRTWJKQnZXa0tFeV9HME1sTlpPa2VscElaczFoYm1TemhLQ3o2SHVRakZEVkg3SW4xRm5sVTQ2ekl2OVlJa3JHRG1fdHpsSWZuOWxNbFFEVk1CWmQ0MXViM1RBc2RBNEh2WWZRbjV1VHc</guid></item><item><title>"You Actually Absorb So Much More": For Better Gut Health, Remember This 1 Easy Thing Every Time You Eat - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE1iY3JBUjk1ZktpTjlfTFl4bFhKZjcwbWsybDRXN2d4RXI1aFNMdkV6WHNVTklVTGpjVXBrTTdpWHBvaWV1OWRNTjEzZFFTakY4SU11aGNzSkxtMC1WN2JqYUFVYmNRdlpiaW1mY3hWTnh2dDFf?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;There are countless reasons to desire a healthy gut. Achieving and maintaining a robust microbiome — the trillions of beneficial bacteria and the useful chemicals they’re producing — in the lower section of our gastrointestinal tracts can aid our bodies with everything from battling pathogens to bettering our mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do we do it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I get people to do is, firstly, think about diversifying their plants and trying to get 30 different kinds of plants across the week,” &lt;a href="https://www.theguthealthdoctor.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7815631" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Megan Rossi&lt;/a&gt;, a Ph.D. holder and registered dietitian who is known in some circles as the “queen of gut health,” recently told us — Raj Punjabi and Noah Michelson, the co-hosts of &lt;a href="https://shows.acast.com/am-i-doing-it-wrong" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7815631" data-affiliate="true"&gt;HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?”&lt;/a&gt; podcast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rossi said that those plants should come from what she calls “the super six”: whole grains, nuts and seeds, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and herbs and spices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we want this diverse range of bacteria in our gut, which has shown to have a diverse range of skills and kind of like superpowers, then we need to feed them that diverse range of fertilizers, otherwise they’ll die off — they won’t grow,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rossi, the founder of &lt;a href="https://www.theguthealthdoctor.com/clinic" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7815631" data-affiliate="true"&gt;The Gut Health Clinic&lt;/a&gt; in London, also gave us a tip for better gut health that’s useful no matter what you’re putting in your mouth: Chew your food more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It really just comes down to digestion,” she said. “Not only do we start to physically break down food in our mouths, but we have enzymes in our saliva that start to chemically break it down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that the more masticating we’re doing, the more nutrients we’re coaxing out of our food, which is good for our guts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130715134643.htm#:~:text=The%20study%20found%20with%20fewer,to%20go%2C%22%20Mattes%20said." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7815631" data-affiliate="true"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; looked at almonds, and they compared people who chewed the almonds 10 times versus 40 times,” Rossi told us.&lt;/p&gt;

The virus can be transmitted via droppings, urine, blood and saliva. The rats also provide a vessel for the virus to move between farms and houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear what agency initially identified and tested the rats — or why the rats were tested. A spokeswoman for Riverside County’s public health department said she was unable to provide a response to those questions, and directed them to the USDA. The USDA did not respond to questions Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the first rats identified as having the disease in the United States since 2021, when this latest version of the H5N1 virus made its debut in North America. Other mammal species that have since been infected include skunks, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-01-18/cat-deaths-bird-flu-prompts-pet-food-new-rules"&gt;domestic cats&lt;/a&gt;, bottlenose dolphins, harbor seals, foxes, mountain lions and coyotes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 50 species of North American mammals have been infected, including &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-02-13/cdc-study-h5n1-bird-flu-in-dairy-cows-more-widespread-than-thought"&gt;tens of thousands of dairy cows&lt;/a&gt; — with cases confirmed in at least 973 herds across 17 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery, disclosed Wednesday, comes at a time when the Trump administration is trying to rehire dozens of USDA bird flu scientists it had recently fired, based on cost-cutting recommendations from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the USDA did not respond to inquiries from The Times about the rats or the fired employees, the agency said in a statement &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bird-flu-in-rats/" target="_blank"&gt;to CBS News&lt;/a&gt; that it was working “to swiftly rectify the situation,” and said it had exempted veterinarians and other emergency response personnel focused on bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency “continues to prioritize the response to highly pathogenic avian influenza,” it told the news agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 22:54:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNSDRyc1BtZjFfOGJUQnZaZkNzbkp3WXktZVVUWU44QWYxMnVUblUzUV9fQ3VsTG5Kb0Rrbm1pZy0td3FUT1BVMHk3OVI5S3NLbHc3NW1JU0QwV0kxdEpBYzFwTTNCOTMzOWEtWTNIVW1lWFVacUxaX1FobmRLWUY4dVE3a1hMempFSUw4MTVJMTdzZw</guid></item><item><title>Opinion | RFK Jr. Makes His First Anti-Vaccine Move - The Wall Street Journal</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxOOExQeXFzUDk4bEg2WFJneEhKTG53bGlmYXJ2aVpnODJNRld3cnNVUmhrQ190TEVfcmpERXlscGx2TGQ0Z3JQZE12ZURwY1k2V0pwSF9VcjRfdFNoNGFlLTdrekVqZW5RRFNyamZ6NElFTG9OZy1RN2VzeE8wNENpc1hpR3d3Z2pzQVUwazVFbWdHUmM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 22:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxOOExQeXFzUDk4bEg2WFJneEhKTG53bGlmYXJ2aVpnODJNRld3cnNVUmhrQ190TEVfcmpERXlscGx2TGQ0Z3JQZE12ZURwY1k2V0pwSF9VcjRfdFNoNGFlLTdrekVqZW5RRFNyamZ6NElFTG9OZy1RN2VzeE8wNENpc1hpR3d3Z2pzQVUwazVFbWdHUmM</guid></item><item><title>Dozens of dead birds recovered from banks of Shark River suspected of having bird flu - News 12 New Jersey</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxNLXAybnFPTk1qdUNjSEVRbjNnU1p4aUc2X1FMS1RkLW9Db3J2Z0RyXzBqNnNDWDZKUnVHWmtuUkRYZW9Wa29SSkpud1RkZ2Z4ZmpMa1BBZ3FET0gwVk5BZXJ6M0Rjcl9CeDE4OWYwQ3ZSRFRreHFJU3RMYkZsVVY5LXB3dXdKSUFCSzdGUDBvbUpXS3JOQ0dMaDM0d1BXTkRGU3BhYWJzYUVkMjRxR1pkVWUzNFA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div alignitems="normal" justifycontent="normal" direction="column" gap="1rem,1.25rem" flexwrap="nowrap" class="sc-fsYfdN hQgjIe sc-1348a9b4-0 lhdfiP"&gt;&lt;p class="block"&gt;Up to 100 dead geese, swans, and ducks have now been recovered along the banks of the Shark River in Monmouth County – all from suspected bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“We started seeing the dead birds probably about a month ago, maybe a little bit longer,” said Ken O’Brien, who lives along the Shark River in Shark River Hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“These poor swans are dying on the beach and convulsing and it’s horrible to see,” said Mary, another neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;For people like Mary and Ken, seeing these disturbing sights from their yards has become common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“I’m concerned about children because they’re always down there and there’s a playground there. If the foxes drag the birds, there it’s not too healthy,” said Mary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Arlene Sciarappa is the secretary and acting treasurer of the Shark River Cleanup Coalition – a group dedicated to preserving the beauty of the tidal estuary.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="block"&gt;“Although it hasn’t officially been confirmed, it’s pointing toward the avian flu, and we want to make sure people should avoid contact with the birds, if at all possible,” she said. “They expect with the weather warming up they expect a lessening of the avian flu."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Dead birds haven’t just been seen in Neptune Township. The suspected bird flu is affecting the entire Shark River Basin from Neptune City to Belmar to Wall Township, where 55 dead birds were recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;More dead birds were seen in Ocean County along the banks of the Manasquan River in Point Pleasant Borough. The DEP says if you see birds acting strangely, give them a call. No human cases of bird flu have been reported in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Crews have since cleaned up all the dead birds along the Shark River from the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Officials say the first case of what's known as "highly pathogenic" bird flu has been found in a Union County live poultry market. The unnamed store is under quarantine and will be disinfected. The state says no infected poultry was sold to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;If you want to report a suspected bird flu case, call the DEP at &lt;b&gt;877-WARNDEP&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 New Jersey</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 22:46:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxNLXAybnFPTk1qdUNjSEVRbjNnU1p4aUc2X1FMS1RkLW9Db3J2Z0RyXzBqNnNDWDZKUnVHWmtuUkRYZW9Wa29SSkpud1RkZ2Z4ZmpMa1BBZ3FET0gwVk5BZXJ6M0Rjcl9CeDE4OWYwQ3ZSRFRreHFJU3RMYkZsVVY5LXB3dXdKSUFCSzdGUDBvbUpXS3JOQ0dMaDM0d1BXTkRGU3BhYWJzYUVkMjRxR1pkVWUzNFA</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu discovered at poultry market in Union County - NorthJersey.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQS3VPUTNmTHRrQWZ1V2Z6V0pXdGdJb3RTQ3BhVEJTOE4wRzB0OGNyMlNvTmpkcVV2YVNVUUlCblh6U0ZVUTAxZHF2U1lmSXVqYk0ySkl3NWlMS0lNVmhwUHBzV0F3Q0V2b1BSTmlQRG9FRkFmNXVPS2kxMzVQdFloZzFtU1Zna0ctbzIybkNYazFkX3pyTkdpbU4yMDZTYzJoMl9PQUVHRC1OT2E3YWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;a class="gnt_em gnt_em__fp gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/health/2025/02/19/dead-birds-found-in-monmouth-and-ocean-counties/79186976007/" data-t-l=":l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - Dead swan, ducks, geese and sea gulls spotted along Jersey Shore waters" data-g-r="nav_mo" data-g-tn="pgcss" data-g-mtn="pg79186976007" data-g-moh="hpgm" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" data-c-id="79186976007"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_gl_i" src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/19/PAPP/79186207007-dsc-00173.JPG?crop=7007,3943,x0,y364&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=372&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" elementtiming="ar-lead-image" srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/02/19/PAPP/79186207007-dsc-00173.JPG?crop=7007,3943,x0,y364&amp;amp;width=1320&amp;amp;height=744&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" alt=""&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="23"&gt;&lt;svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg__ca"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_expand"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="Dead swan, ducks, geese and sea gulls spotted along Jersey Shore waters" aria-label="The state DEP was contacted over bird flu fears after dead waterfowl were found along the Shark River."&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul class="gnt_sh"&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_sh_li"&gt;No humans have been reported infected with the virus in NJ.

			&lt;p&gt;There's a window of time in our lives we've all passed through yet still know so little about: early gestation. Researchers have found a pair of genetic deletions associated with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="152965" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; that likely occur in that formative period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery comes from a team of researchers led by &lt;span&gt;Harvard Medical School &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;clinician-scientist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eduardo Maury, who combed through genetic data from blood samples of nearly 25,000 people with or without schizophrenia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the two genetic alterations need further validation, the findings strengthen an emerging idea that the seeds of schizophrenia aren't always inherited, yet still may be acquired long before someone meets the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152956" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152956" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/blastocyst_image_642.jpg" alt="embryo as a blastocyst" class="wp-image-152956 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/blastocyst_image_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/blastocyst_image_642-428x415.jpg 428w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/blastocyst_image_642-600x582.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152956" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Schizophrenia might begin with changes that take place when we're little more than a bundle of cells. (Juan Gartner/Science Photo Library)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, it opens the door to early prevention a fraction wider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia"&gt;Schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; is a serious neurological disorder arising from a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors, with events such as &lt;a href="https://library.neura.edu.au/category/schizophrenia/risk-factors/non-genetic/index.html"&gt;childhood trauma&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-with-schizophrenia-have-a-strange-telling-response-to-the-epstein-barr-virus"&gt;viral infections&lt;/a&gt; likely &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.686666"&gt;playing a role&lt;/a&gt;, amplifying someone's risk of experiencing its symptoms of delusional or disordered thinking later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It affects in &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schizophrenia"&gt;1 in 300 people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, usually manifesting in early adulthood. Yet there is evidence to suggest the physiology responsible for schizophrenia originates either in early pregnancy or as a result of gestational complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, scientists studying bundles of lab-grown cells resembling tiny brains &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia-begins-in-brain-in-first-trimester-of-pregnancy"&gt;found evidence&lt;/a&gt; that disorganized brain cells dividing hurriedly and differentiating too early may give rise to schizophrenia. And in 2021, researchers pinpointed &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pregnancy-problems-and-placental-genes-further-reveal-chances-of-schizophrenia"&gt;specific genes in the placenta&lt;/a&gt; that are active during complicated pregnancies and associated with the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Maury and colleagues identified two genes, called NRXN1 and ABCB11, that appear to be associated with schizophrenia when copies of the genes go missing in utero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're looking at mutations that are not inherited from the parents," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/994215"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; Chris Walsh, senior author and geneticist at Boston Children's Hospital, at the time the research was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In NRXN1 and ABCB11, the researchers found alterations called &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Copy-Number-Variation"&gt;copy number variations&lt;/a&gt;, a type of genetic error where copies of a gene or long stretches of DNA are duplicated or, in this case, deleted in one person compared to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On rare occasions, copy number variations can be inherited, contributing to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2011154/"&gt;around 5 percent&lt;/a&gt; of schizophrenia cases. Those so-called germline mutations would show up in every cell of the body, since they were written into a person's genome before the fertilized egg undergoes its first division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research also suggests &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia-is-80-genetic-according-to-this-massive-study-on-twins"&gt;four out of five cases&lt;/a&gt; of schizophrenia can be traced back to genes inherited from the child's parents, with more recent studies adding to the list of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-new-schizophrenia-risk-genes-in-first-of-its-kind-study"&gt;known genetic links&lt;/a&gt;. Yet that still leaves roughly 20 percent of cases without an obvious basis in inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the two genes identified in this study, Maury and colleagues found partial deletions of NRXN1 in five cases of schizophrenia, and none in the unaffected individuals of their control cohort. This prevalence was much higher than in population-level databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NRXN1 helps brain cells transmit signals and it has been associated with schizophrenia before – when &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3725"&gt;those mutations are inherited&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When mutations aren't inherited but acquired during early development or later life, they are termed &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_mutation"&gt;somatic mutations&lt;/a&gt;. As these arise after embryonic cells have already begun separate journeys forming the different cells that will go on to create a full human, they will be passed onto the descendants of the cell with the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152950" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152950" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/mosaic_diagram_642.jpg" alt="diagram of mosaic body" class="wp-image-152950 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/mosaic_diagram_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/mosaic_diagram_642-428x415.jpg 428w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/mosaic_diagram_642-600x582.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152950" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Genetic changes in some embryonic cells (sCNV) can be passed down to whole areas of tissue as we develop, giving rise to what's known as mosaicism. (Maury et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Genetics&lt;/em&gt;, 2023)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So somatic mutations are found only in a fraction of body cells; for example brain and blood cells, but not sex cells. This is the kind of NRXN1 mutation Maury and colleagues found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second gene identified, ABCB11, is known to encode a liver protein but its link to schizophrenia is far less certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maury and colleagues found deletions within the ABCB11 gene in another five cases of schizophrenia, all of whom didn't respond to antipsychotic medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That one came out of nowhere for us," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/994215"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Maury of ABCB11. "There have been some studies associating mutations in this gene with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but it hasn't been strongly implicated in schizophrenia per se."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(23)00139-8"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt; that alterations in these two genes "may contribute a small but significant part of the genetic architecture of schizophrenia."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to figure out just how much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(23)00139-8"&gt;Cell Genomics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in July 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, the Mediterranean Diet has dominated conversations about healthy eating, and for good reason. The Mediterranean Diet, which emphasizes fresh vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, and healthy fats like olive oil, has been shown to have heart-protective, anti-inflammatory, and longevity-promoting benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But fewer people know about the Atlantic Diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Less famous but no less nutritious, this diet is deeply rooted in the coastal regions of Portugal and Spain — much like the Mediterranean diet. A new study compared the two diets, finding that the Atlantic Diet is just as good as the Mediterranean one. In fact, it may even be a bit healthier (and cheaper) in some regards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-the-atlantic-diet"&gt;What is the Atlantic Diet?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never heard of the Atlantic Diet, you’re not alone. While researchers have studied the Mediterranean Diet extensively, the Atlantic Diet is still emerging in scientific circles. Yet, this diet — rich in seafood, whole grains, and seasonal produce — is good for your heart health, metabolic function, and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two diets are similar in many regards, emphasizing healthy fats, less meat, and fruits or vegetables as well as physical and social activity. The Atlantic Diet is more prevalent in northern Spain and Portugal, whereas the Mediterranean one is more prevalent in the south. But there are also significant differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic is all about fresh and seasonal foods, as well as hearty dishes. It has a particular focus on seafood, whole grains, legumes, and a bit more dairy products than the Mediterranean Diet. Fish, especially oily varieties like sardines and mackerel, play a central role, providing heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Vegetables such as cabbage, turnips, and onions, along with rye, maize, and potatoes, are staple ingredients, reflecting the region’s cooler climate and agricultural traditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike many modern diets, the Atlantic Diet maintains traditional cooking methods like boiling, grilling, baking, and stewing. Atlantic foods often include hearty soups. Dairy, including cheese, yogurt, and butter, is consumed moderately, while olive oil remains the primary fat source. Red wine, in small amounts, is also a customary part of meals, mirroring Mediterranean traditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, there are also differences. Whereas the Mediterranean Diet (MD) uses more wheat, the Atlantic relies more on rye and corn. Where MD favors more legumes, AD features more potatoes and cabbages. And where MD uses more citrus fruits like oranges and lemons, AD includes more apples, pears, and plums. Soups and stews are more important in AD than MD.&lt;/p&gt;

But the Atlantic Diet is probably just as good (or even better). Image via Unsplash.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How do the two diets compare in terms of health?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean Diet has been studied extensively and is linked to a lower risk of heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and even cognitive decline. But could the Atlantic Diet offer similar benefits?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AD has been far less studied, but there is some research on it nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="file:///C:/Users/marea/Downloads/10.1515_opag-2022-0406.pdf"&gt;2010 study in Portugal&lt;/a&gt; examined the relationship between the Southern European Atlantic Diet (SEAD) and heart disease. Researchers found that adherence to the Atlantic Diet reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack) significantly, suggesting that this diet might be just as heart-friendly as the Mediterranean Diet. In fact, some heart markers were better for people who followed the Atlantic Diet than the Mediterranean Diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why? The Atlantic Diet emphasizes fatty fish rich in omega-3s, known to lower bad cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and improve blood vessel function. The high fiber intake from whole grains and legumes also helps regulate blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2023 study also found that older adults who followed the Atlantic Diet had higher gray matter density in their brains, a marker for better cognitive health and reduced risk of dementia. Furthermore, fermented dairy, fiber-rich vegetables, and whole grains promote gut microbiome diversity, which is essential for digestion, immunity, and overall health. Some researchers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8401068/"&gt;suggest that&lt;/a&gt; the Atlantic Diet &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2814624"&gt;might have an advantage&lt;/a&gt; over the Mediterranean Diet because it incorporates a wider variety of prebiotic and probiotic foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why haven’t we heard more about the Atlantic Diet?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its clear benefits, the Atlantic Diet remains relatively unknown. A part of this boils down to hype and trends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the Mediterranean Diet boasts glamorous, colorful dishes like Greek salads and Italian pasta, the Atlantic Diet is simpler and heartier, often consisting of soups, stews, and boiled fish. It’s less Instagram-worthy and less fancy, though very healthy and nutritious. The Mediterranean Diet was championed by multiple countries and recognized by UNESCO, while the Atlantic Diet has not been internationally promoted in the same way. Hopefully, that will start to change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, the Atlantic Diet has received far less scientific attention. There’s not been enough spotlight on the Atlantic diet because it’s similar to the Mediterranean one and it’s hard to find more people who adhere to it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean Diet will always be a gold standard, but it’s time to put the Atlantic Diet on the map. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As research continues to explore the benefits of the Atlantic Diet, one thing is clear: Portugal’s lesser-known super diet deserves a seat at the global table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other affected counties in Texas include Dawson (6 cases); Ector (1); Lubbock (1); Lynn (1); Terry (20); and Yoakum (4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Texas, the majority of the cases continue to be in children: 26 are in infants and young children ages 0 to 4, and 51 are between ages 5 and 17. All but five cases have been in unvaccinated people. Sixteen people (roughly 18 percent) have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New Mexico, there have been no hospitalizations, and five of the nine cases are in adults. The other four cases were between the ages of 5 and 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given low vaccination rate in the area and the contagiousness of measles, health officials expect the outbreak to continue to grow. Measles is one of the most infectious viruses known; 90 percent of people who are unvaccinated and exposed will fall ill. The disease is marked by high fevers and a telltale rash and can cause severe complications in some, including younger children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, about 20 percent of people with measles are typically hospitalized. Five percent develop pneumonia, and up to 3 in 1,000 die of the infection. In rare cases, measles can cause a fatal disease of the central nervous system later in life called Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Measles also wipes out immune responses to other infections (a phenomenon known as immune amnesia), making people vulnerable to various illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

ACIP holds full-committee public meetings at least three times a year to review evidence on vaccines and vote on new recommendations. The February 26-28 meeting was to be the first under new HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is not required to accept the recommendations of ACIP advisers, the agency has traditionally adopted those recommendations and based adult and child immunization schedules on them, as have groups like the American Academy of Pediatricians. ACIP recommendations also play a role in determining which vaccines are covered by health insurers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Postponing a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices delays vital discussions and needed decisions on a variety of vaccines by trusted and well-vetted experts," Infectious Diseases Society of America President Tina Tan, MD, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2025/statement-on-acip-meeting-postponement-and-removal-of-vaccine-information/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "ACIP relies on a well-established, transparent and evidence-based process for evaluating the optimal use of vaccines that plays a critical role in strengthening public health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The postponement is adding to fears that Kennedy, a longtime critic of vaccines who in the past has accused ACIP members of conflict of interest, could make changes to the group. Voting members of ACIP are appointed by the HHS secretary and serve overlapping terms of up to 4 years. Reporting by &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223"&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt; indicates that ACIP is among the advisory committees that Kennedy is targeting for changes, and there has been concern that he may appoint people with anti-vaccine views to the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HHS has not yet said when the ACIP meeting will be rescheduled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Changes of CDC vaccine promotional campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, changes to the CDC's promotional campaigns for various vaccines could be forthcoming. Earlier this week, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated"&gt;National Public Radio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; reported that the agency was stopping its "wild to mild" flu vaccination campaign, which was launched in September 2023. The idea behind the campaign was to promote how well flu vaccines work at preventing serious outcomes, like emergency department visits and hospitalizations, even if they don't always prevent infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/"&gt;Stat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; reported yesterday that the campaign was one of several to be pulled, and that CDC officials were told that Kennedy wants future vaccine campaigns to promote the idea of "informed consent" in vaccine decision-making. Informed consent is an ethical and legal requirement that aims to ensure patients understand the risks and benefits of medical treatments before agreeing to those treatments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tan said that pulling promotional campaigns for vaccines "leaves Americans with fewer tools to make critical decisions in consultation with their doctors to protect themselves and their families." She called on Congress to hold Kennedy accountable for actions that could undermine vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Weakening our nation's vaccine infrastructure will lead to significantly lower immunization rates and result in many more outbreaks of serious, preventable hospitalizations and deaths," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;HHS did not respond to a request to confirm the status of the CDC's vaccine promotion campaigns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Long-COVID advisory committee terminated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In other news, an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/commencing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; issued this week by the Trump administration calls for the termination of the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Long COVID, a group that included long-COVID scientists and experts from several universities. The committee, which was established in November 2023, was still recruiting members and had yet to hold a meeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The order also terminated the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Health Equity Advisory Committee. Also created under the Biden administration, the committee aimed to address structural racism and systemic barriers in CMS programs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The two were among several federal advisory committees and programs axed under the order, which seeks to reduce "elements of the Federal bureaucracy that the President has determined are unnecessary."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The researchers’ findings may support continued studies, leading to a potential, novel treatment to help manage ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;div class=" figure"&gt;&lt;div id="image-caption" class="text-gray-500 italic"&gt;&lt;div class="blockText_blockContent__TbCXh"&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Amlodipine tablets | Image Credit: © Ming - stock.adobe.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that begins in childhood and persists throughout life, affecting a person’s ability to navigate daily responsibilities, including academic and professional tasks. It manifests differently among individuals, with symptoms generally falling into 3 categories: hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention. The intensity and visibility of symptoms can also fluctuate based on environmental factors and situational demands.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Traditional treatment for ADHD includes stimulants such as methylphenidate (Ritalin; Novartis), which have demonstrated significant success in real-world treatment of patients, as well as non-stimulants like viloxazine (Qelbree; Supernus Pharmaceuticals Inc). Patients may also utilize behavioral therapy or executive function coaching, as well as integrating healthy lifestyle habits. However, there is always a need for innovation and alternative options that offer patients more agency and options when receiving treatment for ADHD. Additionally, stimulants do have adverse effects such as appetite loss, high blood pressure, headaches, and sleep disturbance, as well as a potential for misuse.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;In a study published in &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;, researchers explored the potential of amlodipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, as a foundation for novel ADHD therapies. Of the 5 drugs they tested, only amlodipine significantly reduced hyperactivity.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2,3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;To assess its effects, researchers tested amlodipine in zebrafish, a widely used model for studying brain function due to their genetic similarity to humans, sharing about 70% of genes. The results showed that amlodipine reduced both hyperactivity and impulsivity—2 core symptoms of ADHD. Further analysis confirmed that amlodipine crosses the blood-brain barrier, allowing it to directly influence brain function.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2,3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The team then turned to human genetic data and found a striking link between ADHD and the same calcium channels targeted by amlodipine (α1-C; CACNA1C, β1; CACNB1, α2δ3; CACNA2D3), suggesting a relevant pathway for treatment. Additionally, a UK-wide patient data analysis revealed that individuals taking amlodipine reported fewer mood swings and reduced risk-taking behavior, further supporting its potential therapeutic benefits. Given its tolerability, cross-species efficacy, and strong genetic evidence, amlodipine presents a promising avenue for developing novel ADHD treatments.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2,3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;"Repurposing amlodipine, a well-established blood pressure medication, offers a promising and swift pathway to address ADHD symptoms,” Matthew Parker, MD, co-author of the study from the University of Surrey, said in a news release. “Our research indicates that, due to its existing approval and safety profile, amlodipine could be rapidly redeployed as a treatment option for ADHD, potentially providing relief to patients sooner than developing new medications."&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6 class="text-sm pb-4 pt-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REFERENCES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;h6 class="text-sm pb-4 pt-2"&gt;2.

            “I remember being a new nurse in the ER, and even though I had all of the head knowledge of what to do in emergencies, when that patient rolled in from EMS … I found myself having a hard time catching my breath,” said Lorenzini, who is also the host of the nursing education podcast &lt;a href="https://www.rapidresponseandrescue.com" target="_blank"&gt;Rapid Response RN&lt;/a&gt;. “And if you can’t get your body to work, to do the things that you know how to do, then you can’t help the patient.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6s00073b5vcmowo9no@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s common for the body’s natural “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/04/health/stress-health-connection-wellness/index.html"&gt;fight-or-flight&lt;/a&gt;” response to kick in, and it may be hard to react the way you would otherwise like to under pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6s00083b5vevnvqmia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But you can train the mind and body so that when the next high-stress situation arises, you are better prepared. Here’s how to keep your cool no matter what happens, according to Lorenzini and other experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t00093b5vvaimrare@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When Lorenzini was 9 years old, she went snorkeling with her family in Florida. At the time, she didn’t have the upper body strength to hoist herself up from the water, so she would need help getting back on the boat any time she left.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000a3b5vr0m6df7z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But when she encountered a barracuda in the water, she became so scared that the adrenaline her body produced gave her the strength to swim faster than she ever had and jump in the boat on her own.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000b3b5vp2gxxjwk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lorenzini noted that if she hadn’t known how to swim well or hadn’t practiced attempting to get back in the boat on her own, she would not have been as prepared for her quick escape from the predatory fish. “I would have just still floundered in the water, not knowing what to do,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000c3b5vu97kuthq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her experience shows how being prepared ahead of time can help in high-stress situations, such as completing a nursing program, practicing a speech in front of a mirror or studying for a big test.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000d3b5voeknib1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But there are also ways to build up what’s called your nervous system resilience, the ability to keep the body’s stress response in a healthy balance, ahead of such stressful situations, said Dr. Inna Khazan, a lecturer on psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a clinical psychologist specializing in health psychology and performance excellence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000e3b5vq7i81a8b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One technique she often advises is to exercise the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21773-heart-rate-variability-hrv" target="_blank"&gt;heart rate variability&lt;/a&gt;, or HRV, which is the way in which a person’s heart rate goes up and down and constantly varies. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21773-heart-rate-variability-hrv" target="_blank"&gt;Having a higher HRV&lt;/a&gt; is a sign that your nervous system is healthy and that your heart can adapt better to daily challenges and stressors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000f3b5vdjym6tzf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By working on &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8924557/" target="_blank"&gt;resonance frequency breathing&lt;/a&gt;, a slow diaphragmatic breathing that is usually three to seven breaths per minute and synchronizes with your heart rate, the HRV will increase, which will train the heart to recover from stressors more quickly, Khazan said. People with higher HRVs tend to find it is easier to make decisions, focus and respond in challenging situations, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000g3b5vqzqztv0h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By checking in throughout the day concerning smaller stressors, a person can be more in tune with the way their body responds under high stress, said Julie Uhernik, a licensed professional counselor and registered nurse in Parker, Colorado.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000h3b5v0nmcxudm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Keeping a physical or mental note of how much stress you feel on a scale of 1 to 10 throughout the day can help you identify not only your stressors but also the natural symptoms of stress that occur, she added, and doing so can help you better react in those high-stress situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000i3b5vdt3prn1d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Basic needs such as eating a healthy diet and getting enough sleep at night are crucial as well for improving your response to high stressors, Khazan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000j3b5vtm438hzg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When a person starts to feel the sensations of stress, thoughts such as “I can’t do this” or panic begin to happen, Lorenzini said. But when you’re mindful that these reactions, such as a change in breath or heartbeat, are normal, then you can use that awareness to your advantage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000k3b5ve0ml4uay@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I call it super nurse, or super Sarah, where I can function at my best,” she added. “With time, I kind of retrained myself to say, ‘Oh, these things that I’m feeling in my body, these are not hindering me. These are actually making me a better clinician, a better nurse.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000l3b5vg4v7so0z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Reminding yourself to take slower breaths is also important, Khazan said. She recommends breathing in normally through the nose for four seconds and breathing out — as if you are gently blowing out a candle — for six seconds to help rebalance the system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000m3b5vft6m5cxj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The goal is not to relax but rather “a self-regulation practice, so it can help the body get to that optimal level of activation,” Khazan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000n3b5vluka7xgh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Using your senses, such as taking note of the feeling of your feet on the ground or looking around to assess the situation and the reactions of others, can help you pause and think before reacting, said Uhernik, who is also a disaster mental health responder for the American Red Cross and a consultant in emergency preparedness for mental health professionals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000o3b5vhpbbhu8f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultimately, it is important to remember that stress is inevitable, especially when emergencies happen, Uhernik said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm75edc6t000p3b5v3lqhbw5y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A little bit of stress is good for us. It keeps our nervous systems primed to respond when we need to, and to go back to a state of calm when things are OK and there’s no threat in the environment,” Uhernik said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

The five-year average for this week in the flu season is under 500 flu-related hospitalizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="2"&gt;“We’re still in the midst of flu season, and unfortunately this latest news reminds us that flu can be serious and people should not take the possibility of getting the flu lightly,” said Dan Suffoletto, public information manager for Public Health-Dayton and Montgomery County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="4"&gt;In Montgomery County, there have been a total of 620 flu hospitalizations, accounting for 6.8% of all the flu hospitalizations in the state. This is also a rate of 5.27 flu-related hospitalizations per 100,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="5"&gt;In Butler County, there have been 193 total flu hospitalizations, accounting for 2.1% of all flu hospitalizations in the state, according to ODH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-subscription__placeholder subscription-promo b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="7"&gt;In Clark County, there have been 168 total flu hospitalizations, accounting for 1.8% of all flu hospitalizations. Greene County has seen 153 flu-related hospitalizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-nativo_placeholder--moap b-clear-both is-deferred"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="9"&gt;Flu activity usually peaks between December and February. In Ohio, flu activity has been increasing since early December and has increased more rapidly since the beginning of the year. Current activity is very high, ODH says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="10"&gt;Since the start of the season, more than 9,000 flu-related hospitalizations have been reported in Ohio, according to ODH. Influenza A is the predominant type of the flu being seen in the state, and it &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/flu-a-vs-flu-b" target="_blank"&gt;causes more severe illness &lt;/a&gt;than type B flu, the Cleveland Clinic says. Flu A accounted for 96% of flu cases reported in late 2024, according to the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="11"&gt;The current number of flu-related hospitalizations is well above the five-year average for this time in the season, ODH says. The state’s five-year average omits years from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 flu seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="12"&gt;There were 9,134 total flu-related hospitalizations by the end of the 2022-2023 flu season, according to ODH, which is in mid-May. The end of the 2023-2024 season had 10,236 hospitalizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="14"&gt;Ohio generally reports between one and six influenza-associated pediatric deaths each season. During the last flu season, five pediatric deaths occurred, down from six reported in the 2022-2023 season, according to ODH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="is-deferred MP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="is-deferred RP09 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="17"&gt;It’s not too late for parents and kids to get a flu vaccine, Vanderhoff said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="18"&gt;“It may very well prevent you or your loved ones from getting seriously ill,” Vanderhoff said. “And, especially during flu season, it’s important to maintain good hand hygiene and to stay home if you are sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="19"&gt;Flu vaccines are available at most health care providers’ offices, local health departments and retail pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="20"&gt;Other effective ways to avoid getting or spreading the flu include washing hands frequently or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer, covering coughs and sneezes with tissues or coughing or sneezing into elbows, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="21"&gt;“Staying home from when you’re sick and staying away from others is critical to helping stop the spread of the flu,” Suffoletto said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text text-center" data-index="24"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Dayton Daily News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 21:45:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOR05hWEdsb0xGWjVpNm1zdk9NQy1jbmU2dGpLR29UMVVWei1XSTFGUjI2UlJqV3dlTjhZUTZQSjBHM0FacW9VVkVSdnFyZF81MzhKTDdRMGRTQkhGdU05NC1mMHh4UjJIOW42ekpGWkxqdFE3SDhsTmRFdGpXMmttcnlMYzVBeDYxZGZvdWZWNUdQWnVPSlRxbERhVFE1allJZlA1eG1HOXZvTTI1SmgzajhsUURaQ1kxMm0zWWtVVXVIOFBZc3pBcEtpS0RTaUN5SXRWUXVKNk43TGhNZkFZWWtn</guid></item><item><title>Are you protected?

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON D.C., DC — As &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas/285-e97815dc-93d3-4943-b605-23d14e30d2ce"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; continues to spread across Texas, there are things you should know about the condition. Below are questions and answers from the Centers for Disease Control as well as a lot of bullet points about vaccination, including how to find your vaccination records if you’re not sure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is only some of the information from the CDC. You can find a lot more on &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;their page about measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Am I protected against measles?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, you are protected if you have records showing at least one of the following.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You received two doses of measles-containing vaccine and you are either a K through 12 child or an adult who is in a setting that could pose a high risk for transmission. That includes being a post-high school student, someone in healthcare or someone who travels internationally&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You received one dose of measles-containing vaccine and are either a preschool-age child or an adult in a high-risk setting for transmission&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lab confirmed you had measles at some point in your life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lab confirmed you are immune to measles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You were born before 1957&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an international traveler, the CDC considers you protected if you have records of at least one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You received one dose of measles-containing vaccine and you’re between 6 and 11 months old&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You received two doses of measles-containing vaccine and you’re 12 months or older&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lab confirmed you had measles at some point in your life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A lab confirmed you’re immune to measles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You were born before 1957&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do I need a booster?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. The CDC considers people who received two doses of measles as a child protected for life. If you’re not sure, check with your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you only received one dose of measles vaccine as a child?&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, if you were born after 1957, one dose is considered sufficient to be considered protected from measles. Some adults may need a second dose. The CDC says adults who are going to be in high-risk settings for transmission should make sure they’ve had two doses at least 28 days apart.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those high-risk adults, according to the CDC, are:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students at post-high school education institutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare personnel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;International travelers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who public health authorities determine are at increased risk during an outbreak.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Signs and symptoms of measles&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, symptoms usually begin seven to 14 days after infection. They can be dangerous, especially to babies and young children. You should contact your health provider immediately if you think you or a family member has been infected.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to more than 104°)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC says two to three days after symptoms begin, you may notice two white spots (Koplik spots) inside the mouth. Three to five days after symptoms appear, a measles rash may appear. It usually starts as flat red spots that appear on the face and hairline and spread downward to the neck, arms, legs and feet. Small raised bumps may also appear on top of the flat red spots. Spots may become joined together as they spread.  The rash could come with a fever spiking up to 104 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who is most at risk?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children younger than 5 years of age&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adults older than 20 years of age&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pregnant women&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with weakened immune systems, such as from leukemia or HIV infection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is measles deadly? What are the complications?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, around one in five unvaccinated people in the U.S. who get measles are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One in 20 children with measles gets pneumonia. One child in every 1,000 who gets measles will develop encephalitis, which is swelling of the brain. That could leave a child becoming deaf or with intellectual disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly one to three of every 1,000 children who get measles will die from respiratory or neurological complications.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For pregnant women who have not had the MMR vaccine, measles could cause premature birth or a baby with a low birth weight.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is extremely rare, according to the CDC, but can be deadly. It is a condition that results from a measles infection that happened earlier in life. It could show up seven to 10 years after a person has measles, even if the person fully recovered. The risk may be higher for people who had measles before the age of 2.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can I get measles twice?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Minnesota Dept. of Health and New York City government, you cannot get measles if you've already had it.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tgnaNewNode"&gt;What are the vaccines for measles?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The available vaccine is MMR, which contains a combination of measles, mumps and rubella vaccines. Two vaccines are available for use in the U.S.: MMR II and PRIORIX. The CDC says they’re considered interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the MMRV vaccine, which contains a combination of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella – or chickenpox – vaccines. It’s only for use in kids 12 months old through 12 years old.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find a whole lot more about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" id="isPasted"&gt;vaccines on the CDC website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can I tell if I've been vaccinated against measles?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there's no national online database, there are some things you can do to track down your vaccination records. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-adults/recommended-vaccines/keeping-vaccine-records-up-to-date.html"&gt;Here's a page from the CDC on how you can do that&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

This newly identified mechanism is independent of external stimuli and could influence vision by alternating between detail enhancement and object detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiments involving over 200 participants confirmed the effect across various conditions, including different breathing rates, lighting, and visual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests the brainstem may control this process, as the function remains intact in individuals without an olfactory bulb. Since pupil size impacts visual clarity, this discovery may help explain how breathing influences attention and perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pupil-Breathing Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Pupil size is smallest during inhalation and largest during exhalation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vision Optimization:&lt;/strong&gt; Breathing may naturally switch vision between detail focus and object detection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could inform new diagnostic tools for neurological disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Karolinska Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have discovered a fundamental mechanism that affects the size of the pupil, namely our breathing. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Physiology&lt;/em&gt;, shows that the pupil is smallest during inhalation and largest during exhalation – something that could affect our vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107906"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/breathing-visual-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Previous research shows that smaller pupils make it easier to see details, while larger pupils help us find hard-to-see objects. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the aperture in a camera, the pupil controls how much light reaches the eye. It is therefore fundamental to our vision and how we perceive our surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three mechanisms that can change the size of the pupil have been known for over a century: the amount of light, focus distance and cognitive factors such as emotion or mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now scientists have discovered a fourth: breathing. The pupil is smallest around inhalation onset and largest during exhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This mechanism is unique in that it is cyclical, ever-present and requires no external stimulus,” explains Artin Arshamian, associate professor at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since breathing affects brain activity and cognitive functions, the discovery may contribute to a better understanding of how our vision and attention are regulated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted five experiments with over 200 participants, examining how breathing affects pupil size under different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the effect persisted whether participants breathed quickly or slowly, through their nose or mouth, if lighting conditions or fixation distance varied, if they were resting or performing visual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference in pupil size between inhalation and exhalation was large enough to theoretically affect vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that the function is intact in people born without the olfactory bulb, a brain structure that is activated by nasal breathing. This suggests that the mechanism is controlled by the brainstem, a fundamental and evolutionarily conserved part of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now investigating whether changes in pupil size during breathing also affect vision. Previous research shows that smaller pupils make it easier to see details, while larger pupils help us find hard-to-see objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that our vision may switch between optimising for distinguishing small details when we inhale and detecting faint objects when we exhale, all within a single breathing cycle,” says Martin Schaefer, a postdoctoral researcher at the same department at Karolinska Institutet and the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may also be clinical applications, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One potential application is new methods to diagnose or treat neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, where damage to pupil function is an early sign of the disease,” says Artin Arshamian. “This is something we want to explore in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by the Swedish Research Council and the European Research Council (ERC).

However, evidence for a coupling between respiration and pupil size remains scarce and inconclusive, hindered by small sample sizes and limited controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the importance of pupil size in visual perception and as a reflection of brain state, understanding its relationship with respiration is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In five experiments using a pre-registered protocol, we systematically investigated how respiratory phase affects pupil size across different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiment 1 (&lt;em&gt;n = &lt;/em&gt;50), we examined nasal and oral breathing at rest under dim lighting with nearby fixation points, then replicated these results under identical conditions in Experiment 2 (&lt;em&gt;n = &lt;/em&gt;53).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiment 3 (&lt;em&gt;n = &lt;/em&gt;112) extended this to active visual tasks, while Experiment 4 (&lt;em&gt;n =&lt;/em&gt; 57) extended this to controlled breathing at different paces under ambient lighting with distant fixation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in Experiment 5 (&lt;em&gt;n =&lt;/em&gt; 34), individuals with isolated congenital anosmia (born without olfactory bulbs) were used as a lesion-type model during visual–auditory tasks to assess whether the respiratory–pupil link depends on olfactory bulb-driven oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all conditions – free and controlled breathing; different tasks, lighting and fixation distances; and with and without olfactory bulbs – we consistently found that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest during exhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We term this effect the pupillary respiratory-phase response, the fourth known mechanism influencing pupil size, alongside the pupillary light, near fixation and psychosensory responses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 21:24:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5Dak9uWlRLbGFwSzdCdVZESVRZaHRXNXAydi1Oc243RHQtT2E3ajlOcWJnY0pqOHRVOGRKOWJtV0ViNDlCM05RNGxDWWsxNDAtaS0zVm5QcmFTck00SmlZR1lweFd4ZVNRY0pHcDY4MUc</guid></item><item><title>Data suggest Paxlovid doesn't reduce severe COVID in older, vaccinated adults - University of Minnesota Twin Cities</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxPRklJeTNxNVNhZ3dqM1piNHl2VGx2Z0hmcnFXOEdxM0xkS2VnRHFCU2RPSFRacE5tTzdFMnExNm5iRXRid29hVjZEcGF4REM5LXdPVzFaOEY3cGVpNFpLNU5mcWg5QWVDZnFjRE4tbXo2VkRXRE9aLWpxcEpDQnlLWlcxaEVxdUdrRWw2cVVaa3VwRVdGY3VlcFhEaWVWYUtMT0NGSXBxNnljTmE5?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study yesterday in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; suggests Paxlovid, the oral antiviral approved for use against severe COVID-19 symptoms, did little to lessen the risk of hospitalizations and death among older, vaccinated adults in Canada.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer’s initial clinical trials on the drug were conducted on unvaccinated adults, the authors said, with median ages of 42 to 46 years. Older adults are more likely than younger adults to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and are at the greatest risk of severe complications from the virus.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2830683"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;looked at all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalizations in adults in Ontario, Canada. Between April 1 and November 30, 2022, Ontario implemented an age-restrictive policy on access to Paxlovid, with only those 70 and older able to get the drug.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since the strongest predictor of severe COVID-19 is advanced age, it has been crucial to obtain evidence on whether the results of the Pfizer trials generalized to older and vaccinated populations,” said John Mafi, MD the study’s lead author in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074346"&gt;&lt;u&gt;press release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the Univeristy of California Los Angeles.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors compared outcomes among adults just under 70 years who were not prescribed Paxlovid to those who were given the antiviral. The authors identified 1,620,884 Ontarians aged 65 to 74 years during the study period; most (87.5%) received at least 2 COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paxlovid's effect 4 times weaker than in clinical trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the authors found the prescription rate of Paxlovid more than doubled after the age-based policy was put in place, increasing by 118% at age 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the increased use of Paxlovid did not result in fewer hospitalizations or deaths for those treated with the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no significant differences just below compared with just above age 70 years (per 10,000 patients per month) in COVID-19-related hospitalizations (39.5 vs 42.9) or all-cause mortality (109.6 vs 115.7).&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors said the study showed Paxlovid’s effect on COVID-19 hospitalization among vaccinated older adults is four times weaker than the effect originally reported in Pfizer’s 2022 clinical trial, reducing hospitalizations by 1.3 percentage points. The original clinical trial showed an absolute risk reduction of 5.5 percentage points against hospitalizations.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since the study found no significant effect on COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths among vaccinated older adults, our findings underscore the urgent need for further randomized-clinical trials investigating Paxlovid’s effects in higher-risk populations, such as older subgroups who are frail or immunosuppressed,” Katherine Kahn, MD, another study author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Rice University and Vanderbilt University have made significant advancements in the fight against prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They have shown that combining a small-molecule therapy called tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) with focused ultrasound (FUS) can effectively reduce tumor size in laboratory models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings were published in the journal Advanced Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide, claiming approximately 10 million lives annually. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The collaborative study, spearheaded by Michael King, a professor of bioengineering at Rice, and Charles Caskey, an associate professor at Vanderbilt, is pioneering in its approach. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It highlights how low-intensity mechanical forces can be utilized with TRAIL to provide a new treatment strategy for cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;King highlights the pressing need for better treatment options for advanced and recurrent prostate cancer, which ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Prostate cancer is also the most commonly diagnosed cancer in over 100 countries,” he notes, highlighting the urgency for innovative therapeutic strategies. He expresses optimism that their findings could soon translate to practical clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional treatments for prostate cancer often come with severe side effects, causing a growing interest in FUS therapies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This non-invasive method enables targeted treatment directly at tumor sites, which can limit damaging effects on surrounding healthy tissues. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shrinking-prostate-tumors"&gt;Shrinking prostate tumors&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges with TRAIL therapy is its short lifespan in the bloodstream, lasting only about 30 minutes before being metabolized. This necessitates frequent dosing to achieve any substantial effect, which can lead to increased side effects and patient inconvenience. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“TRAIL specifically triggers the death of cancer cells while sparing healthy ones,” King explains, noting that previous studies indicated mechanical forces like fluid shear stress (FSS) could enhance TRAIL’s anticancer effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, FSS operates primarily within the circulatory system, limiting its effectiveness to circulating tumor cells and not addressing solid tumors directly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This limitation highlighted the need for a practical method that combines mechanical forces with TRAIL therapy in a localized manner. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers sought to explore whether FUS could serve as a viable partner for TRAIL in treating primary prostate tumors before they metastasize.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In their investigation, graduate students Abigail Fabiano and Malachy Newman conducted experiments using prostate cancer cell lines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-no-surgery-needed"&gt;No surgery needed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their objective involved varying the &lt;a href="https://news.rice.edu/news/2025/rice-led-study-finds-focused-ultrasound-therapy-improves-cancer-treatment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;parameters&lt;/a&gt; of FUS treatment to ensure that healthy cells were not adversely affected by mechanical forces while maximizing the effects on cancer cells. The results were promising. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the combined application of FUS and TRAIL substantially diminished the number of cancer cells and the overall size of tumors compared to administering either treatment alone. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This foundational study lays the groundwork for a potential new &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/health/prostate-cancer-breakthrough-speed-up-research" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;therapy&lt;/a&gt; for prostate cancer,” King states, underscoring the importance of their research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their findings could open new avenues in medical treatment, indicating a future where mechanical therapies like focused ultrasound are used alongside small-molecule treatments to tackle various cancers more effectively while minimizing adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the researchers continue to refine their approach, the hope is that &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/science/3d-genetic-map-prostate-cancer" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; insights will benefit patients with prostate cancer and pave the way for innovative cancer therapies that enhance the efficacy and safety of existing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

The issue: Sifting through the ever-growing array to find high-quality, healthful options requires some skill (and some patience).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="base paragraph" data-testid="article-1:default:blockRenderer:2:paragraph"&gt;That’s why we tapped registered dietitian &lt;a data-moduletype="Article Body" data-elementclicked="Body Text Link" href="https://www.instagram.com/realnutrition/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;Amy Shapiro&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, CDN for a little navigational help. For starters, here’s a quick refresher on the super nutrient that’s taken center stage: “Protein plays a vital role in overall health, including hormone and immune function, making it a crucial part of any balanced diet,” Shapiro says. “Short-term benefits include improved satiety, &lt;a data-moduletype="Article Body" data-elementclicked="Body Text Link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14522731/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;blood-sugar control&lt;/a&gt;, mental clarity, and muscle recovery after exercise.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2025.2469643?src=exp-la"&gt;&lt;span&gt;research letter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published this week in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Emerging Microbes &amp;amp; Infections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, researchers at the Canada Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) describe their discovery of a mutated H5N1 avian flu strain resistant to the antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu) on eight chicken farms in British Columbia in October 2024.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When investigating a widespread and ongoing H5N1 outbreak at 45 poultry farms, the CFIA National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease team sequenced the virus, identifying it as a clade 2.3.4.4b A(H5N1) strain. The virus had a neuraminidase surface protein derived from a low-pathogenic flu virus from a North American lineage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite evidence to suggest this substitution reduces viral fitness, viruses harboring this substitution spread rapidly across 8 farms in the 15 days following its initial detection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Isolates from 8 farms reveal a mutation in the neuraminidase protein (H275Y) that is exceptionally rare among clade 2.3.4.4b viruses (present in 0.045% of publicly available clade 2.3.4.4b isolates)," the researchers wrote. "NA-H275Y is a well-known marker of resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The virus likely emerged in Canada in September 2024, the authors said. The US Department of Agriculture later updated its North American A(H5N1) genotyping tool GenoFlu to designate the virus as genotype D1.1. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Despite evidence to suggest this substitution reduces viral fitness, viruses harboring this substitution spread rapidly across 8 farms in the 15 days following its initial detection," the researchers wrote. "As oseltamivir is the most widely used therapeutic and prophylactic against IAV [influenza A virus], the continued circulation of viruses harboring NA-H275Y may necessitate a re-evaluation of influenza treatment strategies in Canada."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's unclear whether the mutated virus is still circulating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four more H5N1 detections in US&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yesterday, the US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed four more highly pathogenic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;&lt;span&gt;avian flu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; detections, including a commercial turkey farm in Sac County, Iowa, affecting nearly 30,000 birds and three backyard flocks in Maine and Pennsylvania totaling nearly 500 birds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the last 30 days, 101 commercial and 55 backyard flocks have been infected, at a loss of 21.7 million birds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are fasting, calorie counting and deprivation slowing your metabolism and preventing you from meeting your weight loss goals?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The basic theory behind a calorie deficit is simple: Burn more calories than you consume and your body will dip into its fat reserves for energy, leading to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jillbrownfitness.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jill Brown&lt;/a&gt;, a certified master health coach and nutrition expert, told The Post that this concept is known in fitness circles as CICO, or “calories in, calories out.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what does it mean if you’re counting calories and not getting results?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The basic theory behind a calorie deficit is simple: Burn more calories than you consume and your body will dip into its fat reserves for energy, leading to weight loss. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Charlie's – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women typically need to eat between 1,800 and 2,400 calories daily to maintain their weight, while men require around 2,000 to 3,000, according to the USDA’s &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts agree that weight loss happens when the body is in a calorie deficit. But determining how many calories you consume and what equals a deficit is slippery math.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199212313272701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;landmark study&lt;/a&gt; found that people miscalculate how many calories they take in by as much as 1,000 calories a day. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Really counting calories&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When people tell me they’re in a calorie deficit, I ask them, ‘How do you know?’ They can’t really answer.  The truth is, if you’re not losing weight, you’re simply not in a calorie deficit,” said Brown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown explained that part of the disconnect between counting calories and losing weight is that most folks don’t know their exact resting metabolic rate, or RMR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Home smart scales are unreliable, and I see many people using this as their primary measurement,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, “getting a DEXA scan that measures your body composition is your best option,” Brown said. “The next best would be an InBody machine. These machines will give you an estimate of your RMR, or how many calories your body burns a day doing nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jill Brown says stress triggers hunger.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jill Brown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;These machine-generated estimates are based on body weight, muscle mass, bone mass and fat mass, providing a more accurate picture of your caloric expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown explained that online calculators only factor in age, height, weight and self-reported activity level, leaving ample room for error.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They can be off by as much as 20% to 30% in normal, young, healthy people. They may be even further off for older people or those who have illnesses or obesity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Not to mention, none of these calculators factor in medications or gut health status.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown noted that some drugs can mess with your hunger, alter your gut biome and even slow your metabolism, making it that much harder to create a calorie deficit.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;But how do you count calories without tech?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those looking to nail a calorie deficit without integrating technology, Brown recommends a good old-fashioned food diary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I have my clients honestly log everything they eat (even little sips and licks) for a good week or two and weigh in daily. If the scale is still the same at the end of the week, they’re burning as many calories as they’re taking in,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Brown, once that baseline is established, it’s easy to find ways to reach a deficit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Eat a little less (think smaller portions, skipping snacks or not having desserts), do a little more physical activity and get good sleep, and you’ll be in a deficit,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Brown explained that online calculators only factor in age, height, weight, and self-reported activity level, leaving ample room for error. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Monkey Business – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;While a deficit is a healthy goal, Brown says &lt;em&gt;deprivation&lt;/em&gt; is not only ineffective but counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Extreme calorie deficits only work in the short term because they place a huge amount of stress on the body,” said Brown.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“If you try to do this for weeks or months, your hunger hormones will go nuts and compel you to eat back all those calories. If you continue to fight through it, your body will respond by slowing down its metabolic rate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you continue to eat an extremely low-calorie diet, your body will simply burn less calories to preserve energy. You will even burn less calories when you exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown also noted that regular exercise suppresses hunger, but over-exertion amplifies it. Thus, she recommends people find a sweet spot between challenge and exhaustion that works for them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She counts rest and relaxation as additional requisites for weight loss: “Getting quality sleep while managing stress prevents those sneaky hunger hormones from derailing you when you don’t realize it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Indefinite changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stat asked the HHS specifically about the Wild to Mild campaign as well as promotional campaigns for other vaccines, but an HHS spokesperson puzzlingly responded with a statement saying: "No, the CDC was not told to take down the flu vaccination campaign webpage," which wasn't what the outlet had asked about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement went on to say: "Unfortunately, officials inside the CDC who are averse to Secretary Kennedy and President Trump’s agenda seem to be intentionally falsifying and misrepresenting guidance they receive." NPR received the same statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile on Thursday, The Washington Post reported that the HHS told the CDC to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-meeting-postponed/"&gt;indefinitely postpone a meeting of its vaccine advisory committee&lt;/a&gt; (the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP), which Kennedy has criticized. ACIP, comprised of independent experts, meets regularly to review and discuss vaccine safety and efficacy data and vote on recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACIP was previously &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/Xvof3"&gt;scheduled to meet February 26 to 28&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/agenda-2025-02-26-28-508.pdf"&gt;discuss a large number of vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, including those against meningitis, influenza, RSV, chikungunya, HPV, mpox, pneumococcal infections, Lyme disease, COVID-19, and CMV. An HHS spokesperson told the Post that the meeting was "postponed to accommodate public comment in advance of the meeting," but there is no rescheduled date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading medical experts and organizations, such as the American Medical Association, quickly sent &lt;a href="https://www.fightinfectiousdisease.org/post/sign-on-letter-to-preserve-acip-meeting"&gt;a joint letter urging Kennedy to preserve the meeting&lt;/a&gt;. "Each ACIP meeting holds tremendous weight and relevance," the letter states. 'Infectious diseases are constantly evolving opponents; vaccines are among the best tools for constantly adapting and responding to the latest public health threats. ... Making America healthy requires healthy discussion and timely, evidence-based decisions. This meeting should be no different."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, also on Thursday, Politico reported that &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223"&gt;Kennedy is preparing to remove ACIP members&lt;/a&gt;. And, the AP noted earlier that during a speech to HHS employees on Tuesday, Kennedy vowed to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/childhood-vaccines-schedule-kennedy-trump-hhs-4d5e6c52c602f5edbcd837748605e9d0"&gt;investigate the CDC's childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;, despite assuring senators prior to his confirmation that he would not make changes to it.&lt;/p&gt;

You can also contact your state’s health department. States, and some major cities, have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/iis/contacts-locate-records/index.html"&gt;vaccine registries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VFUJEPO47NEYNNDXUMF6J7W2MI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But there is no national database, and a state’s vaccination records may not be comprehensive for adults, experts said.

A week later, deadly outbreaks with a slower disease course occurred at two high-biosecurity chicken farms, where dead birds were found mainly near the barns' air-intake vents; the entire population was culled. All farms had their own wells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts hypothesize that the slower disease course in the chicken barns may be due to lower H5N1 transmissibility in chickens, waning concentrations of the virus over distance from the duck farm, or housing conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers, from the State Veterinary Institute Prague, used genetic, epizootiologic, meteorologic, and geographic data to reconstruct events suggesting that wind was the mechanism of H5N1 transmission between poultry on at least two of the farms. Three H5N1 strains collected from birds at all three farms were genetically identical, no large waterways were near the chicken farms, and the duck farm didn't share staff or contractors with the chicken farms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our results suggest that the contaminated plume emitted from the infected fattening duck farm was the critical medium of HPAI transmission, rather than the dust generated during depopulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What's more, meteorologic data revealed a breeze in the direction of the chicken farms, cloudy conditions that could have kept the sun's ultraviolet light from killing the virus, and virus-supporting cool air. The team didn't conduct air sampling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our results suggest that the contaminated plume emitted from the infected fattening duck farm was the critical medium of HPAI transmission, rather than the dust generated during depopulation," the study authors wrote. "They also strongly implicate the role of confined mechanically-ventilated buildings with high population densities in facilitating windborne transmission and propagating virus concentrations below the minimum infectious dose at the recipient sites."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Airborne not only or major mode of spread&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lead study author Alexander Nagy, PhD, told CIDRAP News that he and his team became convinced about the role of windborne transmission in these outbreaks when they confirmed the identical identity of the H5N1 strain in the donor and recipient farms, the nearly ideal weather conditions during the transmission event, and the slow disease progression in the chicken barns characterized by feed and water consumption before clinical signs appeared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Additionally, the affected birds [dead chickens] were located in sections closest to the air inlets," he said. "Finally, we excluded all other plausible explanations."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-left"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), publisher of CIDRAP News, said airborne transmission can be very important, "meaning that that's the most logical explanation for when you have many barns with outbreaks in one geographic area where human biosecurity cannot be implicated as a reason for transmission."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the past, he said, the poultry industry has been reluctant to acknowledge airborne transmission because of the implications it may have for its practices: "The industry's reluctance to accept this possibility is not that dissimilar to what we saw with the lack of some in the medical and public health communities to recognize that SARS-CoV-2 transmission was also airborne."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the researchers did a very good job of laying out their hypothesis and supporting data, their conclusion should be interpreted with caution, said David Swayne, DVM, PhD, a poultry veterinarian who retired as an avian flu researcher with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agriculture Research Service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I think we, as veterinarians who deal with avian influenza and other infectious diseases, would acknowledge that there is some airborne—and I'll use the word dissemination—and that may lead to transmission," he said. "But we have to be cautious to make sure people understand that it doesn't mean that it's the only way, nor that it's the major way. And each individual facility is going to be different."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montserrat Torremorell, DVM, PhD, chair of the Department of Veterinary Population Medicine at the University of Minnesota, called the researchers' argument for airborne transmission "compelling."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Meteorological conditions, timing of infection, housing conditions of the animals, susceptibility of the animal populations that became infected and the lack of other epidemiological links between the premises are supportive of airborne transmission in this case," she said in an email.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During an avian flu outbreak in Minnesota, Torremorell collected air samples inside and outside facilities housing three infected turkey and three egg-laying chicken flocks. Air samples from five of six flocks tested positive for large quantities of H5N1 virus, all of them in the active infection stage. The negative sample was from a flock in the advanced stage of depopulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The larger number of positive samples were inside the facility and at the exhaust fan (~5 m [meters; 16 feet] away from the facility), and the number of positives decreased with distance, but even with that we identified some suspects (traces of RNA material) at about 150 m and 1 km [kilometer; roughly a half mile)," she said. "Viable virus (through virus isolation) was found inside the facilities, at the outside of the exhaust fan and at about 100 m."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Entry mechanism difficult to determine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;David Stallknecht, PhD, professor emeritus at the University of Georgia's College of Veterinary Medicine and a wildlife expert, said the study provides additional circumstantial &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6692305/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to several &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0031114"&gt;&lt;span&gt;studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggesting windborne viral spread. But he added that the mechanism of disease transmission into a poultry house is hardly ever identified, because there is no way to control for variables. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It basically says that it could have happened, and I would not dispute that," he said. "But to actually come down with concrete proof like you would in an experimental controlled experiment, there's too much going on."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Influenza can be transmitted by a million different ways, probably many of them we don't even know about," he added. For example, whether the virus entered the poultry house via a raccoon, bird, person, or a person's shoes, "those kind of details never really get resolved."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-right"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stallknecht said he and his team tried to research water-based avian flu transmission associated with ducks. "And we got to the point where we just had to quit because the numbers and the probabilities were so extreme," he said. "You can't do an experiment to pick up a one-in-a-trillion event."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Swayne said that moving equipment and people in and out of poultry barns has to be done at a very high level of biosecurity to prevent viral transmission: "Yes, you could have movement of the virus by the wind, but it may be that it's tracked in to the barns by the contamination around the outside, either from wild birds depositing fecal material there as they eat, spilled feed off of grain silos, etc."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He added that just because a virus is transported via the wind doesn't necessarily mean it will enter a barn that way. "The virus can move on particles or water droplets by the wind for a distance, and then it could land and contaminate the environment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Authors were initially skeptical, too&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nagy acknowledged that airborne spread isn't typically considered a primary route of infection in poultry, and windborne spread requires "a constellation of many specific conditions" that behooves further research. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"However, when all conditions align, windborne transmission becomes a feasible mode of spread and could play a more significant role than previously thought, especially in densely populated poultry areas," he said. "The windborne route is important to consider in cases when the infection emerges in new locations without obvious links to other farms or when illness and mortality are first observed near the air inlets."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Poultry operations typically consist of confined, mechanically ventilated buildings with high population densities, a situation unlikely to change. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

James Messerschmidt&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The avian flu also can be transmitted from cats to humans, but again, the instances are few and far between, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, some activists worry the flu’s spread may have already reached the city’s felines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massaro, who feeds the stray cats of Willets Point in Queens multiple days a week and neuters them when she can catch them, has witnessed the felines stalking the slaughterhouses for scraps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cats also are notorious hunters, and strays will go after whatever they can get their paws on, even when they’re not hungry, she emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a natural instinct. They go after the birds. That’s what they do,” Massaro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;More than a dozen ducks and wild birds at the Queens and Bronx zoos are believed to have been recently killed by the virus. Kevin C Downs forThe New York Post&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an estimated 500,000 stray cats wandering throughout the five boroughs, Massaro theorized the flu might have already breached the feline population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cats become infected, they show signs of respiratory illness such as sneezing and difficulty breathing, as well as severe depression and even seizures, &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-h5n1-cats" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not yet known if cats can spread the disease to one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cats have an increased risk if they are in contact with poultry or dairy cows on farms or in backyard flocks, are exposed to sick or deceased wild birds, particularly waterfowl such as geese and ducks, consume unpasteurized dairy products or raw or undercooked poultry, including raw diets, or are in contact with people or other animals known to be infected with H5N1,” Dr. Stephanie Janeczko, vice president of shelter medicine services at the ASPCA, told The Post, adding that the overall risk to cats at the moment is considered low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We recommend that all cats exposed to H5N1 or those suspected of being infected with the virus should be evaluated by a veterinarian.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul temporarily shut down some live poultry markets as the flu runs rampant in the city. Kevin C Downs forThe New York Post&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal Control Cares of NYC, which is overseen by the city, said there are no suspected cases of the avian flu in cats but could not say how the agency knew for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency also did not answer questions about whether the organization is performing necropsies on dead stray cats without obvious body trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You know that the ones that you pick up off the street with its eyeballs hanging out of its head, it was struck by a vehicle,” Massaro said, adding that necropsies are typically only performed on abused animals or pets partly because the procedure can cost between $500 and $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think that they do them routinely,” the advocate said of necropsies on the city’s other dead stray kitties. “But maybe they should start. Maybe they should look at animals that were picked up diseased that have no body trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 18:30:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE9wbTBkbktpeGtfVUM1c3VQOE1oRjl1cVZfT0hBdVhlSGtJd2VpeUtDVl9KNm0zQnRBZDJ6RkxiV1F4T2dzbUVpdG82dTlhRm5ZRk55Q1lMcDI5bDZjWVlfd2E1MkF5Vk1q</guid></item><item><title>Baby undergoes open heart surgery during delivery - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxPR2JmS1dUNDJRTkxNZ1p0d2wydHJubmVlazFWU3pRbGJKR09RN0R2SVRNSHhsUGtzcXFTbnVYNmRGdU95U2xwb0ZXbDUtX000OG9ySEx2M1JBaVc5WHpnbTJPVzdFNHpqQUJuRlN1SkltdDFHZFE1aXhUN2ZMaGJsTXU0TVVKWlVOUk9XNlFOVURVeWpyWm5IUXBFLWRyd9IBowFBVV95cUxQRkVlT1RUdDRnRHRFVlUtUG41RnpVUkdWYk9PRDJFYnROMlVYWC1JcXNhQ1hmb0x0cnhGMlhseVJvVFBCUmJwQldmaGd5am5pV0F2NXpzLWxhWTBIcDg4SHF4ZmhVVDF4cElyVnFjVEdQazNueDQtYU9faERxeWRTeU1ha3pESXRhODBpdUVXNWxOUVJWb3liSVZmX1M2WnNlRjRn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;When Megan Wild delivered her son Luciano, she experienced not only &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/family/story/mom-shares-7-year-daughter-watch-give-birth-108342844" target="_blank"&gt;childbirth&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and Allegheny Health Network have developed a new method for deep brain stimulation. The technique, called "DeepFocus," uses transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) on the scalp and transnasal electrical stimulation (TnES) to achieve more accurate electrical stimulation in the brain. The findings are &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/adac0c" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Neural Engineering&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;DeepFocus uses close proximity and highly conductive pathways offered by thin bones between the nasal cavity and brain to create larger and more accurate electric fields in deep brain regions than traditional scalp &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electrode/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electrode&lt;/a&gt; configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By going through the nose, we can place electrodes as close to the brain as possible without opening the skull," explained Mats Forssell, an electrical and computer engineering research scientist who is a lead author on the study. "We gain access to structures on the bottom of the brain which are hard to reach in other ways. That's what makes this technique so powerful."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeepFocus could enable more efficient and lower-risk targeting of deep brain structures to treat multiple neural conditions, including depression, PTSD, OCD, addiction, and substance abuse disorder. By targeting the brain's "reward circuit" (the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/orbitofrontal+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;orbitofrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, Brodmann area 25, amygdala, etc.) and managing environmental and time of day factors, DeepFocus could disrupt the brain's associations with cravings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeepFocus could provide both short- and long-term treatments. Chronic treatments that require persistent stimulation could be delivered through an implant, while acute applications could be delivered in short sessions with endoscopic insertion and removal of the device.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"The new approach affords access to parts of the brain that have been traditionally surgically challenging," said Boyle Cheng, a professor of neurosurgery at Allegheny Health Network's (AHN) Neuroscience Institute who worked on the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The innovation from the team provides exciting advances in the delivery of energy in terms of both safety and efficacy. Ultimately, the potential for better clinical treatments with fewer complications in patients with various neurological disorders is highly motivating."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is precedent for treating neurological conditions with implanted electrodes in the deep brain, but it requires a sophisticated surgical procedure to implant the system (electrodes, battery, and associated circuitry) which is highly invasive and carries risk of intracranial hemorrhage and infection. This method also isn't steerable, which means the stimulation target cannot be changed once the electrodes are implanted inside the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Early results of invasive deep brain stimulation (DBS) in treating neuropsychiatric conditions have been very promising," said Pulkit Grover, the senior author of this study and a professor of electrical and computer engineering, biomedical engineering, and CMU's Neuroscience Institute. "But the sophisticated surgery required for invasive DBS technology makes it unlikely to be widely adopted. Also, the invasive approach offers limited flexibility to clinicians after electrodes have been placed."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Noninvasive techniques such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/transcranial+magnetic+stimulation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;transcranial magnetic stimulation&lt;/a&gt; (TMS), transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS), and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) have lower risk and are steerable, but aren't as effective as implanted electrodes due to limited depth and resolution. TMS and TES can also cause high scalp pain because of more intense electric currents. DeepFocus offers a minimally invasive solution that is more accurate, less painful, and steerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alexander Whiting, a neurosurgeon and the director of epilepsy surgery for AHN's Neuroscience Institute who worked on this study, said, "This new tool could be a game changer, offering the ability to treat deep areas of the brain in mental health disorders like depression, OCD, and addiction in a minimally invasive way that does not involve traditional incisions, or permanent placement of implanted hardware."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside DeepFocus, researchers developed DeepROAST, a simulation and optimization platform used to carefully calibrate the injected currents in this new technique. DeepROAST simulates the effect of complex skull-base bones' geometries on the electric fields generated by DeepFocus using realistic head models. It optimizes the placement of electrodes on the scalp and in the nose, and helps electrical current injection patterns to be more accurate and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With the DeepROAST platform, we can simulate how the electric field travels inside the brain realistically," said Yuxin Guo, a Carnegie Mellon University Ph.D. student who worked on this research.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"Moreover, DeepROAST automates and optimizes the placement of electrodes on the scalp and transnasally so that deep brain regions can be targeted with better efficiency and focality. This allows stimulation of deep brain targets that were previously difficult to access, enabling more precise interventions for conditions like depression, PTSD, and addiction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grover added, "The U.S. is facing a severe mental health crisis, with PTSD, depression, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/substance+use+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;substance use disorders&lt;/a&gt; among the most pressing societal challenges. While surgically implanted &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/deep+brain+stimulation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;deep-brain stimulation&lt;/a&gt; has shown promise, it lacks both widespread acceptance and the necessary FDA approvals for these conditions. Our minimally invasive, low-risk approach, which can be implemented in an outpatient setting, presents a scalable and widely applicable solution."&lt;/p&gt;

                                        It can be hard to feel sympathy for narcissists, who often lack empathy for others. But a new study sets the ground for, if not a sympathetic view, then a new way to look at those who are constantly aiming to defend their inflated ego, reports the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/02/20/narcissists-study-psychology-ostracism-exclusion/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It finds that people with high narcissism scores who show a heightened sensitivity to social cues and a desire to dominate social situations feel more excluded than their peers—and often they are. Narcissists tend to be ostracized due to their aggression, arrogance, and tendency to view benign social cues as negative, researchers say. And this can exacerbate narcissistic traits over time, creating a "self-perpetuating cycle" of pain.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        "Many people think of narcissism in terms of entitlement and arrogance, but our research highlights that narcissists also frequently experience social pain," lead study author Christiane Büttner, a postdoctoral researcher in social psychology at the University of Basel, tells the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;. Her team focused on so-called grandiose or overt narcissists, who across large-scale surveys reported being ostracized more frequently than individuals with lower levels of narcissism, per &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/20/health/narcissism-social-exclusion-rejection-wellness/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;. While experiments showed people often choose to avoid highly narcissistic individuals, these narcissists were more likely to perceive even ambiguous social interactions as deliberately exclusionary, per the study published Thursday in the &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fpspp0000547"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        "Narcissism may contribute to social exclusion, but ostracism itself can also fuel the development of narcissistic traits," Büttner says in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-02-narcissists-ostracized.html?deviceType=desktop"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, "narcissists who are excluded may become even more narcissistic in response, potentially increasing their likelihood of future exclusion," she tells the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;. The findings indicate that if we have to live with narcissists, it might be best to meet them head-on—in the proper setting. "Addressing these dynamics in structured ways, whether in workplaces, therapy, or social interactions, could help reduce the negative consequences of exclusion for both narcissistic individuals and those around them," says Büttner.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While you may be tempted to banish certain snacks in the name of weight loss because they've gotten a bad rap, know that well-planned snacks may actually support your health goals. “Snacks should have a combination of carbohydrates and protein to help you feel satisfied, give you energy and keep you full,” says Oklahoma City-based registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-d-78a88838/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Katie Drakeford, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from carbohydrates and protein, choosing snacks with nutrients such as healthy fats and fiber may also support weight loss because they take longer to digest, which helps curb your appetite.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “People often feel the fat content of nuts makes them an indulgence. But once I explain nuts' magnificent benefits, they usually try them,” says &lt;a href="https://www.oswalddigestiveclinic.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marcie Vaske, M.S.&lt;/a&gt;, a gut-health licensed nutritionist at Oswald Digestive Clinic in Minneapolis. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to a 2021 review published in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9285885/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obesity Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, higher nut intake was associated with fat and weight loss. Nuts are best known for their healthy fats, high protein and fiber content, which are nutrients that help you feel full to curb hunger between meals. “I recommend people choose nuts with the highest-quality nutrition, such as macadamia, pecan, walnut, Brazil, hazelnut and almonds,” says Vaske.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Packing healthy foods on the go gets easier with dried fruit. “When mid-meal hunger strikes, reach for dried fruit like raisins, prunes, cherries or dates for a tasty and portable snack option,” says &lt;a href="https://www.bethstarknutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beth Stark, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Pennsylvania-based, Beth Stark Nutrition. Stark shares the weight-loss benefits of these snackable sweet bites. “Dried fruit is packed with essential vitamins, minerals and fiber to promote appetite satisfaction.” Look for no-added sugar varieties when shopping and be mindful of your portion size. If you’re eating dried fruits at home, pair them with sources of protein, such as cottage cheese or nuts, for longer-lasting appetite control, says Stark.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People may refrain from popping open the chip bag as a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893676/how-to-lose-weight-when-you-dont-know-where-to-start-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight-loss strategy,&lt;/a&gt; but chips can play a helpful part in boosting your nutrition, believe it or not. “Having chips as a snack while trying to achieve weight loss can help satisfy a craving for something crunchy and salty,” says &lt;a href="https://jennfinkrdn.com/about-2/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jenn Fink, RDN&lt;/a&gt; a registered dietitian nutritionist based in the greater Minneapolis-St. Paul area. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To increase the nutritional value of your chip snack, always pair it up with something that’s both tasty and nourishing. “Consider pairing chips with either salsa or Greek yogurt seasoned with lime juice, salt and pepper. Salsa elevates the taste and provides valuable nutrients such as fiber, lycopene, quercetin and capsaicin, which may reduce inflammation and support weight loss,” says Fink. Meanwhile, Greek yogurt adds protein, further assisting in appetite control,” adds &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasminilkay/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jasmin Ilkay, M.P.H., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition and food communications expert in New York City.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is a nutrient known for supporting weight loss, and you’ll find higher-fiber chips in the snack aisle, depending on how they’re made. “For a healthier choice, opt for chips made from cauliflower or beans,” says Ilkay.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cutting back on carbs is sometimes seen as the ultimate weight-loss hack, and while it may work for some, many people feel deprived of eating the snacks they enjoy, including crackers. Despite what people who follow a low-carb diet may say, eating &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/18002/6-carbs-to-add-to-your-diet-to-help-you-stay-slim/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;carbs can help you lose weight&lt;/a&gt;. “Crackers alone aren’t likely to keep someone full for long, but pairing them with a flavored tuna packet and an apple boosts the fullness factor by adding protein and fiber,” says Fink. Another idea is to smear crackers with hummus or nut butter for “a valuable source of protein and healthy fats, which can assist in stabilizing blood sugar levels and curbing hunger,” says Ilkay.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no denying the skepticism around eating bananas and losing weight. But bananas are too nutritious to avoid, and they are an easy and affordable snack. “Bananas are a rich dietary fiber and potassium source,” says Ilkay. Bananas (especially when green) have resistant starch, a type of fiber and prebiotic that enhances your gut health, and a healthier gut may aid in long-term weight management, according to a 2023 review in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37503494/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cureus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “When bananas are combined with almonds and yogurt, this trio elevates the snack's protein content and provides beneficial monounsaturated fats. These components work together to assist in stabilizing blood sugar levels and promoting a longer-lasting feeling of fullness,” says Ilkay. When you're in the mood for something sweet, try this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/262113/yogurt-banana-sundae/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Yogurt Banana Sundae&lt;/a&gt; (pictured above).

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re not convinced snacking on cheese works for weight loss, maybe we can help. “If you crave savory foods for snacking, cheese is the way to go. Packed with protein, cheese digests and absorbs slowly to deliver maximum appetite satisfaction,” says Stark. Not to mention, cheese provides a wide variety of essential vitamins and minerals. “Cheese has an impressive nutrient profile that includes calcium, phosphorus, potassium and B12 that contribute to one’s overall health,” she adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013604/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-cheese-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cheese has multiple health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also a rich source of calories and fat, so if you’re considering giving cheese a chance, here’s how to do it: “To incorporate cheese into your snack routine, try building a personal-sized charcuterie board with an ounce of your favorite cheese, along with fresh veggies, hummus and a few whole-grain crackers,” says Stark.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Snacks don’t have to stifle your weight-loss goals. Well-planned snacks that include filling, satisfying and essential nutrients like protein, healthy fats and fiber can help make losing weight achievable and sustainable. “Being mindful of your snack portions is also imperative. Snacking wisely, instead of mindlessly, is key in meeting weight-loss goals,” adds Drakeford.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Journal&lt;/a&gt; has reported on the intense argument breaking out between chicken and egg companies who both want different things to fix the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conflict comes down to whether we should vaccinate the flock against the raging &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/bird-flu/"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egg companies believe a stronger government response in necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Craig Rowles, vaccine adviser to an industry trade group and &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/science/"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt; chief at Versova, one of the largest U.S. egg producers, agreed with this suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="read-more-container theme-money read-more-container--article-entry t-010-background-color"

now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egg companies are also campaigning for regulators to greenlight a vaccine that could be administered on farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, this is a sharp reversal from the position they held just a few years ago, further reported by the&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bird-flu-outbreak-chicken-shortage-egg-prices-eb8cced2?mod=article_inline" rel="nofollow"&gt;

The virus has also been detected in dairy cows, raising further concerns about its spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative said: "This is simply a normal step in the research and development phase, not in the implementation of a vaccine strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Clifford, a former chief veterinary officer at the USDA, said: "It’s about developing a strategy that we can share with our trading partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Would you still accept our broiler product if it’s not going to be vaccinated? Is there more reception to that? I don’t know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has signalled its receptiveness to a change in &lt;span id="74b6d179-85cb-49bb-9814-1b631b3841e3" class="suggested-link"&gt;bird flu&lt;/span&gt; policy, particularity whether chickens should be killed when the virus is identified in a flock, which is what currently happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USDA plans to release strategy to combat &lt;span id="220ec60b-7ce6-4cdc-b013-1caf389ba9a6" class="suggested-link"&gt;bird flu&lt;/span&gt; in the coming days, according go the rep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any vaccine that was approved by them would need commercial approval and a clear distribution strategy for the some 300 million US currently hens at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__media"&gt;&lt;div class="article__media-img-container open-gallery" data-index="3"&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;img alt="Woman selecting eggs at a grocery store." data-credit="Getty" data-img="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" data-caption="In the middle of this lies the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture), who seem to be on the fence" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 335px, (max-width: 520px) 480px, 620px" srcset="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=335 335w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=480 480w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=620 620w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=670 670w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=960 960w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=1240 1240w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=1005 1005w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=1860 1860w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=1340 1340w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=1920 1920w, https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?w=2480 2480w" loading="lazy" src="https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/2025-austin-texas-labor-department-971461507.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960" role="img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="article__gallery-count"&gt;&lt;span class="article__gallery-count-value"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article__media-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="article__media-span"&gt;In the middle of this lies the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture), who seem to be on the fence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="article__credit"&gt;Credit: Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The US Sun</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 17:36:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOLWZVVUlTLVpnRjE3VGFGVUZ2T0l0QldBV3pFUkVfVXYxdTFNUE44bE9IbmZob2FhQkVSOU5WTFd3SzVWQ3NMYmowcG1MNVh0Ykp5Z0ZWRTRJV3pHQVE3eXl4dVUzNW8xekE3dFJwQkVzX19kaFluR1NHLWZtcXVSVzY0LTgwVnFiMlHSAY8BQVVfeXFMT3A2aE5IRHNaWkp1NTZfUWk2U1dYTk9KdUpURWlLOTJTQXJTMGhHM2ZOTkJ6TXFKT0V4aHh4WHpLVTdoaEFrc0owYTc2dngyZWtGMFg2Y2NPNnlpcU0wZnZhUWNsbXRSV0cwWUdjWkZqZVFhaDBXc0s4bHBBYjRNdVEzOGh0dnZBVDJLVVZKeE0</guid></item><item><title>Deadly motor-neuron disease treated in the womb in world 1st - Livescience.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxQSnNSSTlnNmlsSndHUUlEQTZ1QW9XNUgwVF9sOUpwLTBTM2JIMEVLUEl3QUxCS2ppNTc2Vlc0emxpUTYtcXBmTDZiN1cwVlhPQ2lsN2M3Y3V1OV9KaElHNkFwcE1Uemk4VnpVUTJTNmdGMmY5M05mVmJncnFiSS0zQlFNLUxIbTE2UkJxa2hla0xWN2FZR3VtS0h6Y1d3d2FEemJ4SjZBM1FaX1BrQ1Bz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A child was treated for a rare, potentially deadly genetic disorder while still in the womb — and now, she has survived past the age of 2 with no signs of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks the first time that this condition, called spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), has ever been tackled before birth, according to a new report published Wednesday (Feb. 19) in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2300802" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2300802" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Over time, SMA eventually leads to the weakening and wasting away of the muscles. It's estimated to affect around 1 in every 10,000 live births.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/the-exceptionally-rare-disease-that-causes-holes-to-form-in-your-brain" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/the-exceptionally-rare-disease-that-causes-holes-to-form-in-your-brain"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The exceptionally rare disease that causes holes to form in your brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mda.org/disease/spinal-muscular-atrophy" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mda.org/disease/spinal-muscular-atrophy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;is usually caused&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by mutations in a gene called SMN1, which contains instructions for how to make a protein called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/smn1/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/smn1/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;survival motor neuron (SMN) protein&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This protein is critical for motor neurons to make proteins and grow the "wires" that send signals out to the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the SMN1 gene is mutated, the body cannot make enough SMN protein, and the nerves cannot adequately send out signals to muscles. As a result, the muscles — especially in the thighs, back, shoulders and hips — begin to weaken and shrink from disuse and a lack of nerve stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pFAqGhhqywPcxs5umvsYTh" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pFAqGhhqywPcxs5umvsYTh slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The severity of these symptoms differs depending on the type of SMA a person has.

Earlier onset symptoms — which show up before or shortly after birth — typically lead to worse survival outcomes. Infants with SMA type 1, which manifests within six months after birth, develop severe weakness that causes difficulty breathing and swallowing, and they often die within the first few years of life without treatment or breathing support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMA type 1 is the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558933/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558933/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;leading genetic cause of infant death&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infant involved in the recent case was found to be at risk for SMA type 1 after undergoing genetic testing in the womb. The parents had already had one child with confirmed SMA type 1 who had previously passed away. The tests revealed that the growing fetus also had mutations in the SMN1 genes on both &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/27248-chromosomes.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/27248-chromosomes.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chromosomes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug risdiplam (brand name: Evrysdi) is one of three treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SMA in infants. A tablet taken by mouth, it causes the body to boost the activity of a second gene, called SMN2, which also carries the instructions for building SMN protein but typically makes less than SMN1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, this drug had only been administered after birth, but in this case, the drug was given to the fetus in the womb upon request from the parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They had already experienced a loss from this horrible disease," study lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.stjude.org/directory/f/richard-finkel.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.stjude.org/directory/f/richard-finkel.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Richard Finkel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical neuroscientist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, told Nature News. Risdiplam is approved for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-oral-treatment-spinal-muscular-atrophy" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-oral-treatment-spinal-muscular-atrophy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;children who are at least 2 months old&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so the FDA gave special clearance for the drug's early use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 32 weeks of pregnancy, the mother started taking risdiplam daily for six weeks. Testing at the time of birth indicated that the drug had indeed been entering the baby's system while in the womb. Roughly one week after birth, the baby herself was given the drug orally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At birth, the infant was found to have higher levels of SMN protein and less nerve damage than other babies born with SMA type 1. In the months since her birth has shown no signs of abnormal muscle development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's obviously very reassuring," Finkel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child will likely have to take risdiplam for the rest of her life, into adulthood, and she will be closely monitored for any changes in her muscle development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that this result is based on only a single case, but despite this, these findings indicate that SMA and other genetic conditions might be more effectively tackled if treatment is started before birth. They hope to investigate if these results can be replicated in larger studies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-pFAqGhhqywPcxs5umvsYTh-5rbT5ZL20WlBYblMA91l1uQRrEHs6iYt" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-pFAqGhhqywPcxs5umvsYTh-5rbT5ZL20WlBYblMA91l1uQRrEHs6iYt slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This means modest weight reduction, reduced stress, a healthier diet, and more physical activity “can all work to restore normal function of the body’s organs and tissues,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;How weight loss can reverse diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Weight loss&lt;b class="cXscX "&gt; &lt;/b&gt;is the most effective way to induce diabetes remission because "insulin resistance is closely linked to high levels of visceral fat," says O.

Although we don't understand exactly how it occurs, Duru says, "we know that visceral fat communicates with the organs that absorb glucose from the blood, causing these organs to develop the insulin resistance that leads to type 2 diabetes." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;(&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/why-is-bmi-inaccurate" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i class=" "&gt;We’ve been measuring BMI since the 70s—but is the flawed metric still helpful?)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This is further evident as &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2791310" target="_blank"&gt;longitudinal research&lt;/a&gt; shows that a high body mass index (BMI) significantly increases one's risk for type 2 diabetes.

New research suggests overuse of products like whey powder or creatine may be affecting young people’s mental health as well as their their physical health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A Canadian study, published Wednesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/mentalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmen.0000217" target="_blank"&gt;PLOS Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;, finds that young people who consume multiple muscle-building products are more likely to show symptoms of a condition called muscle dysphoria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;About 2,730 Canadian teens and adults ages 16–30, mostly white males and females, were recruited via Instagram and Snapchat advertisements. They were asked about their use of six different common workout products — amino acids, creatine monohydrate, pre-workout drinks or powders, protein bars, weight or mass gainers, and whey protein shakes or powders. Protein bars were the most commonly consumed, followed by whey protein shakes or powders and creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study also asked about body image, asking for responses to statements such as, “I feel like I have too much body fat” or “I feel depressed when I miss one or more workout days.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Whether they used supplements or not, 26% of the boys and men scored above the level for muscle dysmorphia — that is, being extremely preoccupied with a perceived lack of muscle mass or tone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Use of the workout supplements and products was associated with more symptoms of muscle dysmorphia, what the researchers called greater “drive for size” (the desire to have bigger muscles) and “functional impairment” (the inability to work or maintain a social life). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On the positive side, young people who used supplements were generally satisfied with how their bodies were responding to them, the study showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Boys and young men can be susceptible to fixating on their muscles, which can lead to obsessive thoughts and exercising to build muscle — weightlifting for many hours a day, for example — to the point it interferes with daily life, &lt;a href="https://socialwork.utoronto.ca/profiles/kyle-t-ganson/" target="_blank"&gt;Kyle Ganson&lt;/a&gt;, lead study author and assistant professor of clinical social work at the University of Toronto, said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s not known how many people in general are affected by this kind of body dissatisfaction, but it’s thought to be “quite rampant in the gym space,” Ganson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ganson said the findings reflect data and trends seen in the U.S. as well. About&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335522000857?via%3Dihub#ab010" target="_blank"&gt; 55% adolescents and young men in the U.S. &lt;/a&gt;use bodybuilding supplements, according to some estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade association and lobbying group that represents businesses that manufacture supplements, said in a statement released after the study: "The most obvious explanation is that people who are dissatisfied with their appearance take steps to change it. That might mean adjusting their diet, exercising more, or taking supplements to support their goals. In fact, the study itself found that supplement users were actually more satisfied with their progress than non-users." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Experts said the findings spotlight how unrealistic body ideals — often fueled by &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=muscle%20growth%20supplement&amp;amp;t=1739811742505" target="_blank"&gt;fitness influencers&lt;/a&gt; who promote or sell workout supplements online — may be driving more children and young adults to overuse powders or pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It doesn’t help that many fitness influencers use filters that deceive others into thinking their appearance is real or naturally attainable, said &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/jesse-mills" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jesse Mills&lt;/a&gt;, a urologist and men’s health specialist with UCLA Health, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a global trend towards anime-like figures and cartoonish proportions,” Mills said. “I really think body dysmorphia in general is the new pandemic.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a study Ganson published last year, nearly half of respondents said &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211266924000215" target="_blank"&gt;online influencers who promoted workout supplements &lt;/a&gt;were a “primary” motivation for their own use of the products. The hashtag &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/creatine" target="_blank"&gt;#creatine&lt;/a&gt;, for example, has over 382,000 posts, many of which are flagged with “creator earns commission” warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The pressure to meet muscular body standards may motivate young men and boys to use supplements more often, to the point where “it’s like second nature,” Ganson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Interestingly, among girls and women, supplement use was also associated with stronger desires for bigger, more toned muscles.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study’s findings underscore the dangerous reality that “companies are profiting off the mental health distress of young people,” said &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/eating-disorders-striped/team/bryn-austin/" target="_blank"&gt;S. Bryn Austin&lt;/a&gt;, a social epidemiologist and behavioral scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. “We have a public health problem here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;What’s more, these companies don’t have to prove their products’ safety before hitting the market, Bryn added. Some bodybuilding supplements have been found to be contaminated with &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/caution-bodybuilding-products-can-be-risky" target="_blank"&gt;prescription drugs, anabolic steroids&lt;/a&gt; and toxic heavy metals like lead and cadmium, according to a &lt;a href="https://cleanlabelproject.org/wp-content/uploads/CleanLabelProject_ProteinStudyWhitepaper_010625.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;recent report by the Clean Label Project&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Evidence is mixed whether the supplements do all they claim, like enhance athletic performance and improve muscle stamina. But when used appropriately, many of the ingredients in muscle-building supplements such as whey protein are safe. Some, like creatine, have been&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211266924000215" target="_blank"&gt; shown to boost muscle mass &lt;/a&gt;and strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Using supplements isn’t “inherently problematic,” Ganson said. Once started, though, “it’s kind of like a Pandora’s box,” especially for boys and young men who often turn to social media for advice. “That’s why you should be careful when taking these supplements; they can only support your goals in so many ways.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Mills, the men's health specialist, cautioned that, for some young men, supplement powders may not be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Imagine you’re an impressionable 18- to 25-year-old who’s working out but not seeing the gains that other guys have,” said Mills, who emphasized that genetics can make it harder for some people to grow muscle. “That is certainly a gateway to, ‘what else is out there?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Bryn’s team conducted a study published last year in the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2827804" target="_blank"&gt;journal JAMA Network &lt;/a&gt;Open that followed 4,000 boys and young men ages 10–27 over 14 years. The group found that people who used muscle-building supplements were eight times more likely to start anabolic steroids compared to those who didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Steroids are “an incredibly effective way to put on lots of mass in a very little bit of time,” Mills said. Because even low doses are associated with side effects, this dangerous mental and physical cycle has become a “public health concern.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 17:14:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNZHFtcEhIVmppUjM4YWw0N0FaNTRwcEp5ZmJpVEJBQVZnRE5kbnJuNHpwd0dPRlVNdDhNZF8zRjZNV1BDRXZFSkRXdVZNeWJUOXhUMUFXLXlOa0NqVUo4NnhRTUtwdTN5MEtjNWNzMlJXbTdhYk1fdlJvamdkYnQzV2tjVnBSenlGZUk1cV9hRHJnYUcxSXlpaTExazhQR215bnBCbDlxc0F0d1EyNm55MEI1dFZuRDFjbmfSAVZBVV95cUxNT05yNy1wcWxGcnpFYnVpeFFyd3lJcjA4LWFMRFozVUxoS1l1SzY0Ni1uRU5Bc0FRSGM3OGVpSHZxMm5JM2ZjcDFXVjVibHMtNFU1TXY1UQ</guid></item><item><title>Report: RFK Jr. Planning to Remove Advisors on Vaccine Committee - Medpage Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE5YT3BzX3ZQRTFEVXZMdU9OYnBMZlZpYm5OZWlOZXJYYjN2T1BkOV92b1BlMlJuRWE3SU1ESWVpTUlsZTE0WEhVSHlyZGl0U1c5M2U3cC1KaThJWG1oaUZCM2NNbFZxZVJTYkFfRUNQUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content-region mpt-article-page" id="js-main-content-region" itemtype="http://schema.org/articleBody" itemid="#main-content-region"&gt;

The process of reviewing committee members has just started, and there is no firm timeline for the removals, nor is it known how many people will be removed, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACIP Meeting Postponed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key committee involved in overseeing vaccine use is the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). That committee was scheduled to have a meeting next week, but that meeting &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/vaccines/114303" target="_blank"&gt;has been postponed&lt;/a&gt; and no new date has been announced. The postponement &lt;a href="https://www.fightinfectiousdisease.org/post/sign-on-letter-to-preserve-acip-meeting" target="_blank"&gt;triggered a letter&lt;/a&gt; signed by the American Medical Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (DSA), and several other medical groups urging the Trump administration to reschedule the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"ACIP had a full agenda of critical, vaccine-related decisions, including discussion linked to deadly illnesses like meningococcal disease," said the letter, which was addressed to Kennedy as well as the acting CDC director, Susan Monarez, PhD, and Sen. Bill Cassidy, MD (R-La.), chair of the powerful Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter noted that the online portal for public comments  --  which is usually made available prior to ACIP meetings  --  was not available for this one. "Rescheduling this critical meeting and reconciling the absent portal for public remarks would represent a meaningful early follow-through from the Trump administration and its new HHS secretary to ensure Americans receive the information needed to protect themselves against vaccine-preventable illnesses," the letter concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, delaying the meeting "delays vital discussions and needed decisions on a variety of vaccines by trusted and well-vetted experts," IDSA President Tina Tan, MD, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;MedPage Today&lt;/em&gt;. "ACIP relies on a well-established, transparent, and evidence-based process for evaluating the optimal use of vaccines that play a critical role in strengthening public health."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concerns About Kennedy's Actions &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility that Kennedy might remove some of the members of ACIP has Georges Benjamin, MD, the executive director of the American Public Health Association, "very worried."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="module-group columns-group" data-preset="body-illustrated-list" data-type="synopsi" data-title="Medical News from Around the Web" id="recirculation-article-body" data-count="3"&gt;
                    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is one of the reasons we opposed him  --  we knew he was lying when he said he was not going to touch this group in particular," Benjamin said in a phone interview. He added that although it's not uncommon for administrations to change members of these committees and he "doesn't want to overstate" his concerns, Kennedy "has views we don't trust on conflict of interest."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad flex-ad" data-pos="bodytext" data-slot="text5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committee members are "thoroughly vetted for conflict and balanced in terms of views," Benjamin said. And contrary to Kennedy's assertion that the committees aren't properly constructed, "they are properly constructed  --  while you might change the people [on them], I don't know how you can not have people with a similar kind of mix."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACIP members include several academics, a chief medical officer of a community health center, a state public health higher-up, and the owner of a family medicine practice. One committee member, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said they were informed of the meeting's postponement from news reports, according to &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, President Trump issued an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/commencing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/" target="_blank"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; that required "the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, and the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy [to] identify and submit to the president additional unnecessary governmental entities and federal advisory committees that should be terminated on grounds that they are unnecessary." Because ACIP is a federal advisory committee, it would be one of the committees under review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy's views on vaccines were a subject of controversy during &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/healthpolicy/114003" target="_blank"&gt;his Jan. 29 confirmation hearing&lt;/a&gt; before the Senate Finance Committee. "Committee staff have examined thousands of pages of statements, books, and podcast transcripts in a review of his record, and the receipts show that Mr. Kennedy has embraced conspiracy theories, quacks, and charlatans, especially when it comes to the safety and efficacy of vaccines," said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Kennedy is fond of saying he's not making recommendations about whether parents should vaccinate their children  --  he's just asking questions and giving people choices," Wyden added. "It's a slippery tactic to dodge any real responsibility for his words and actions, and it is, in my view, absurd, coming from somebody who's trying to win confirmation for a job that is entirely about making recommendations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy tried to lay to rest concerns that he was anti-vaccine. "I believe that vaccines play a critical role in healthcare," he said. "All of my kids are vaccinated. I've written many books on vaccines. My first book in 2014, the first line of it is, 'I am not anti-vaccine,' and the last line is, 'I am not anti-vaccine.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad flex-ad" data-pos="bodytext" data-slot="text6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ceasing of Some Vaccine Campaigns Ordered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan to remove advisors may conflict with &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/washington-watch/114079" target="_blank"&gt;a number of promises Kennedy made&lt;/a&gt; to Cassidy that cinched Cassidy's "Yes" vote on Kennedy's confirmation. Most of the pledges revolved around vaccines, including that Kennedy will work within current approval and safety monitoring systems, and not establish parallel systems. Kennedy also told Cassidy he would maintain recommendations from ACIP without changes, and said that statements that vaccines don't cause autism won't be removed from the CDC website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to those promises, Kennedy "committed that the [HELP Committee chair] may choose a representative on any board or commission formed to review vaccine safety," Cassidy &lt;a href="https://www.c-span.org/clip/5154258" target="_blank"&gt;said in remarks&lt;/a&gt; on the Senate floor on Feb. 4th. "If he is confirmed, HHS will provide 30-day notice to the HELP Committee if the agency seeks to make changes to any of our federal vaccine safety monitoring programs, and the HELP Committee will have the option to call a hearing for further review."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-slot ad box-ad" data-pos="body" data-slot="box"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I will use my authority as HELP Committee chair to rebuff any attempt to remove the public's access to lifesaving vaccines without ironclad causational scientific evidence that can be accepted and defended before the mainstream scientific community and before Congress," Cassidy added. "I will watch carefully for any effort to wrongfully sow public fear about vaccines between confusing references of coincidence and anecdote. But my support is built on assurances that this will not have to be a concern."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News of Kennedy's possible plans for advisory committees came as the CDC was told to stop some of its promotional campaigns for vaccines, including its "Wild to Mild" flu vaccination campaign, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;STAT&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. An HHS official told the CDC that Kennedy wanted advertisements that promote the idea of "informed consent" in vaccine decision-making instead, according to the story. A search for "Wild to Mild" on the CDC website turned up a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2023-2024-new-campaign-wild-to-mild.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu-resources%2Fphp%2Fshareable-resources%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;2023 press release&lt;/a&gt; announcing the campaign but little else.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“The Queen’s had an attack of gout! Hurry!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So exclaimed the crotchety Mrs Meg in Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite, in which Olivia Colman plays a moribund and overweight Queen Anne. The queen was afflicted with, among many other conditions, gout – a disorder which causes joint inflammation and severe pain.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the film, while screaming out in pain, her swollen feet are wrapped in strips of soothing beef. The next day her soon-to-be new favourite, Abigail, collects wild herbs to make a poultice for her. A bit more effective than raw steak, she finds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve got to feel sorry for Queen Anne. She really didn’t have much of a chance, since doctors of her day had no options for treating gout other than quackery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She may have been subject to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40674-015-0012-9"&gt;many other absurd treatments&lt;/a&gt; of the time to alleviate the symptoms, like scorching the blood vessels supplying the feet, slathering them in goose fat, or bloodletting with leeches. By the time she passed away in 1714 aged just 49, death may have come as a welcome relief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queen Anne wasn’t the only member of royalty to suffer with gout. Prince Regent George (later &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1007301/"&gt;George IV&lt;/a&gt;) was similarly afflicted. Gout, then, came to be associated with the aristocracy and over indulgence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gout still affects many people. In fact, it is estimated that in 2020 gout affected &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(24)00117-6/fulltext"&gt;nearly 56 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, a figure that’s predicted to grow to 96 million by 2050. So, a condition that was once considered the disease of kings and queens is a now a disease of the masses, with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21169841/"&gt;younger patients&lt;/a&gt; also being diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, raw meat strips and herbs are no longer required. We now know much more about how to treat gout and how to prevent it recurring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding gout&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gout/"&gt;Gout&lt;/a&gt; is a crystal arthropathy – a group of joint disorders that occur when crystals build up in joints and soft tissues. Gout develops when uric acid levels rise in the bloodstream, before infiltrating the joints where it solidifies and becomes needle-like crystals that inflame the joints, making them incredibly sore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when I say “sore”, &lt;a href="https://patient.info/foot-care/gout-leaflet"&gt;I really do mean sore&lt;/a&gt;: many people who experience gout often describe it as one of the worst pains they have ever felt. It most commonly affects &lt;a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/gout"&gt;the big toe&lt;/a&gt; and it can make even the lightest touch to the  skin unbearable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some gout patients sleep with a &lt;a href="https://www.oxfordhealth.nhs.uk/leaflets/title/advice-for-managing-gout-2/#What_can_I_do_to_manage_gout"&gt;special cage&lt;/a&gt; over their foot that lifts up the bedclothes because they can’t bear even the weight of a bed sheet on the affected joint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gout can affect other joints. It may also cause “tophi” to develop (hard swellings around joints and the ears).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/649762/original/file-20250218-44-uhu4vg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The Gout by James Gillray. Published May 14th 1799.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_gout_james_gillray.jpg"&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gout typically occurs in bouts or attacks, before settling with treatment and becoming dormant. But it can reoccur, requiring more acute treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A diagnosis of gout is based around the classic symptoms: excruciating pain, 
swelling in and around the affected joint and redness. Microscopic examination of the fluid taken from the swollen joint may also show crystals and there is usually raised uric acid levels on blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;High uric acid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High uric acid levels are usually linked to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39702222/"&gt;alcohol excess, obesity, diabetes and hypertension&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://patient.info/news-and-features/gout-diet-foods-to-eat-and-avoid"&gt;diet high in purine-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; has been found to have the strongest association. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/lifestyle-changes-to-reduce-the-risk-of-gout-attacks"&gt;Purines&lt;/a&gt; are compounds comprised of uric acid. &lt;a href="https://www.ukgoutsociety.org/docs/goutsociety-allaboutgoutanddiet-0113.pdf"&gt;Purine-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; include meat and offal, oily fish like mackerel and anchovies, and yeasty foods, like Marmite and beer. It may be a good idea to &lt;a href="https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/nutrition/healthy-eating/which-foods-are-safe-for-gout"&gt;avoid these foods&lt;/a&gt; in excess if you suffer from frequent episodes of gout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Medication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But dietary changes alone are unlikely to stave off symptoms of gout. &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng219"&gt;Medications&lt;/a&gt; can treat both an acute episode of gout and prevent it recurring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the joints are inflamed, options include anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen, naproxen, or steroid medications. Another option is &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/colchicine/"&gt;colchicine&lt;/a&gt;, which is typically used for short periods and can be very effective – though it commonly causes &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/63/4/936/7455266"&gt;bouts of diarrhoea&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the inflammation has settled down, it is important to prevent future attacks. &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/allopurinol/"&gt;Allopurinol&lt;/a&gt; can reduce uric acid levels and therefore the risk of further bouts. There’s also evidence to suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/nutrition/healthy-eating/are-cherries-cure-for-gout"&gt;eating cherries&lt;/a&gt; or drinking &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cherry-juice-for-gout"&gt;tart cherry juice&lt;/a&gt; could reduce the risk of gout attacks, especially if &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3510330/"&gt;combined with alloprinol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to stay free of gout then perhaps it’s time to consider taking preventative action by making subtle lifestyle modifications. Maintain a healthy weight, eat a balanced diet, cut down on alcohol and avoid binge drinking, take regular exercise and keep yourself well hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Researchers found that experiencing shame or guilt while using psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in magic mushrooms, is surprisingly common, affecting about two out of every three users. However, the study also offered a positive perspective, indicating that how well individuals process these difficult emotions, rather than the intensity of the feelings themselves, is linked to their wellbeing in the weeks following the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing interest in psychedelic substances for potential therapeutic uses has largely focused on the positive outcomes and transformative experiences they can induce. However, researchers recognized that a complete understanding of psychedelics requires acknowledging the full spectrum of experiences, including the challenging ones. Historically, negative experiences, sometimes casually referred to as “bad trips,” have been somewhat sidelined in both public conversation and scientific exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists sought to address this gap in knowledge by specifically examining the occurrence of shame and guilt during psilocybin experiences. They were interested in understanding how often these feelings arise, what factors might predict them, and how these emotions relate to a person’s overall wellbeing after using psilocybin. The researchers hypothesized that while psychedelics are sometimes thought to reduce self-focused thinking, they might also, in some cases, bring feelings of shame and guilt to the forefront. This could be due to the profound self-reflection and emotional intensity that these substances can trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work came from me witnessing firsthand the complex ways that psychedelics could affect people — who were sometimes challenged in ways they couldn’t even find language to describe,” said study author David Mathai, the medical director of &lt;a href="https://sattvamedicine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sattva Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and a clinical assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those experiences reminded me of clients that I have seen working as a mental health clinician in traditional settings who struggled with feelings of shame and guilt. I began to realize this was an underexplored but critically important area when it came to understanding psychedelic use, as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers designed a study that tracked individuals planning to use psilocybin in their everyday lives, outside of a controlled clinical setting. They recruited 679 adults who were proficient in English and at least 18 years old through online advertisements and word of mouth. These participants were asked to complete a series of online questionnaires at different points in time surrounding their planned psilocybin experience. The study was conducted over a period of two years, from July 2020 to July 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questionnaires were administered at six different time points: two weeks before, one day before, one to three days after, two to four weeks after, and two to three months after their psilocybin use. The initial survey, completed two weeks beforehand, gathered demographic information and used established psychological scales to measure baseline levels of trait shame (a person’s general tendency to feel shame), anxiety (both current and general), depression, past adverse childhood experiences, and cognitive flexibility (the ability to adapt thinking and behavior). Just before their psilocybin experience, participants were asked if they would have a guide or sitter present and completed a questionnaire assessing their level of psychological surrender or anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the days immediately following their psilocybin use, participants were asked to rate whether they considered the experience to be ultimately positive or negative. They also completed questionnaires measuring the intensity of any mystical-type experiences and challenging experiences they had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially for this study, they also filled out a questionnaire designed to assess feelings of state shame and guilt – that is, shame and guilt experienced specifically during the psilocybin session. This questionnaire was slightly modified to directly ask about these feelings in the context of their psychedelic experience. For those who reported experiencing any shame or guilt, additional questions were asked about how long these feelings lasted, how difficult they were, and whether they felt they were able to constructively process these emotions during the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two to four weeks after their psilocybin use, participants were again asked to complete the trait shame questionnaire and to rate any lasting changes in their personal wellbeing or life satisfaction resulting from the psilocybin experience. Finally, two to three months after their psilocybin use, they completed the trait shame questionnaire one last time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathai and his colleagues found that feelings of shame or guilt during psilocybin use were indeed common. Almost 70% of participants reported experiencing either shame or guilt at some point during their session. Specifically, about 56% reported shame, and approximately 52% reported guilt. For a small percentage, about 12%, these feelings were reported at the highest possible intensity. The duration of these feelings varied, but for most, they lasted between 10 minutes and an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the only factor that consistently predicted experiencing shame or guilt was age. Younger participants were more likely to report higher levels of both shame and guilt during their psilocybin experience. Other factors, including pre-existing levels of trait shame, anxiety, depression, or past adverse childhood experiences, did not reliably predict acute shame or guilt during the psychedelic session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most significant finding was the link between processing shame and guilt and later wellbeing. The study found that the degree to which participants felt they could constructively work through feelings of shame or guilt during the psilocybin experience was a significant predictor of their wellbeing two to four weeks later. In fact, individuals who reported being very capable of processing these emotions during their session actually reported higher levels of wellbeing and mystical experience compared to those who did not experience shame or guilt at all. This suggests that navigating challenging emotions during a psychedelic experience, and finding a way to process them, may be connected to positive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was surprising to see that individuals who were most able to work through feelings of shame or guilt during psilocybin use had the highest mystical experience and wellbeing ratings, even compared to individuals who did not experience those feelings whatsoever,” Mathai told PsyPost. “It may be that a certain degree of contact with psychologically challenging material during psychedelic use allows for greater overall benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of longer-term effects, the study found that, on average, psilocybin use was associated with a small but statistically significant decrease in trait shame that was maintained for at least two to three months after the experience. However, it is important to note that this was an average trend. While most participants showed a decrease in trait shame, a notable minority, about 30%, actually experienced an increase in their general level of shame. This highlights the variable nature of psychedelic experiences and their potential impact on individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are three main takeaways based on our study aims,” Mathai summarized. “1) Acute feelings of shame and guilt may occur more commonly than people expect during psilocybin use and are very difficult to predict; 2) The ability to constructively work through shame and guilt when they arise seems to predict well being for individuals, rather than the magnitude of those feelings; 3) Psilocybin was shown to decrease trait shame on average but increased shame in some individuals, suggesting the importance of appropriate psychological support for psychedelic use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study, like all research, includes some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Shame is a difficult construct to research, and different ways of measuring it may lead to different outcomes,” Mathai noted. “Unfortunately, we were unable to characterize patients’ specific experiences of shame and what it looked like to work through these feelings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build upon these findings by examining shame and guilt in more controlled clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted therapy.Further research could also explore whether different psychedelic substances elicit different types of challenging emotions and investigate the role of cultural background and diversity in these experiences. Understanding how to best support individuals in processing difficult emotions like shame and guilt during psychedelic experiences could be essential for maximizing the potential benefits and minimizing potential harms associated with these powerful substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An important next step would be to use mixed-methods and qualitative analysis to better characterize shame-related experiences with psilocybin,” Mathai explained. “It would also be valuable to replicate this research in more carefully controlled clinical trial settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on our findings and other emerging research, the activation of challenging emotions and memories with psychedelics could pose a unique and context-dependent learning condition for both therapeutic and detrimental forms of reconsolidation. This is an important consideration that deserves further study as we think about optimal safety and support for psychedelic use. However, it’s also worth pointing out that these types of experiences and their potential outcomes are not likely to be detected by the questionnaires routinely used in psychedelic drug development trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02791072.2025.2461997"&gt;Shame, Guilt and Psychedelic Experience: Results from a Prospective, Longitudinal Survey of Real-World Psilocybin Use&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by David S.

                    &lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/1/pgae543/7960038"&gt;PNAS Nexus&lt;/a&gt; found that our mouth microbiome can help identify early signs of cognitive decline. The researchers determined that specific kinds of oral bacteria are associated with cognitive impairment, specifically memory decline and Alzheimer’s disease.  By analyzing the oral microbiome, dentists can potentially offer a unique and non-invasive method for assessing the risk of developing this debilitating condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new study analyzed the oral microbiome of 110 people over the age of 50 in the U.K., according to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63833506/mouth-bacteria-alzheimers-risk-study/"&gt;Women's Health&lt;/a&gt;.  One group had no decline in brain function while the second group had mild cognitive impairment. The group with good memory function had large amounts of the bacteria Neisseria and Haemophilus in their mouths. The second group had higher levels of the bacteria Porphyromonas, common in periodontal disease, and were more likely to suffer memory problems. The researchers noted that the bacteria Prevotella, which is also commonly found in periodontal disease, is also associated with individuals who have the APOE4 gene, which is linked to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists theorize that bacteria in the mouth can trigger inflammation, which then travels to the brain, causing dementia. Another possibility is that when the bacteria is imbalanced, it can impact the formation of nitric acid from the nitrate found in the diet from sources such as vegetables. Nitric acid helps boost memory and communication in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts say it’s too soon to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between oral microbiome and Alzheimer’s, but other researchers believe it’s possible. A study conducted by a team from the &lt;a href="https://www.dental.columbia.edu/news/cdm-researcher-finds-link-between-oral-health-and-dementia"&gt;Columbia College of Dental Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found a “clear link between poor periodontal health and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive aging.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Bramen, a senior research scientist and director of neuroimaging at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, suggests that eating nitrate-rich foods like vegetables can “benefit the oral microbiome by promoting bacteria associated with better oral and cognitive health outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top researcher Panos N. Papapanou, a professor of dental medicine, who was one of the scientists who found the link between periodontal health and Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers, warns that periodontitis is highly prevalent among elderly Americans, and especially among those who have limited access to oral healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are data that demonstrate that people who take care of their oral health have lower general health care expenditures,” he says. “Taking care of your mouth is important for your oral health and function, but also an integral part of general wellbeing as people age.”&lt;/p&gt;

While for others, hunger cues start as soon as the alarm goes off in the morning. Turns out, there’s a lot your body might be trying to tell you if you’re waking up hungry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hunger is the body’s way of signaling it needs fuel, but it can offer a few clues about other aspects of your health and lifestyle, too. How hungry you feel in the morning can be a matter of dehydration, over- or under-eating the night before, what you ate the night before and how well you slept — all things you can remedy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s not better or worse to wake up hungry. Hunger is our body’s natural response to when blood sugar is low to stimulate you to eat and keep the blood sugar higher,” Dr. Deena Adimoolam, a specialist in endocrinology and obesity medicine, tells TODAY.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, if you find yourself ravenous in the mornings, nauseated or disrupted in the middle of the night because of hunger, there might be something more serious going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it mean to wake up hungry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People might worry when they wake up hungry because they think it means they didn’t eat enough the night before or that they’ll be prone to overeating at breakfast, but “waking hungry is perfectly normal,” says registered dietitian Natalie Rizzo, TODAY.com’s nutrition editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;This is especially true if the last meal you ate before bed was dinner, she adds. “For example, if you eat dinner at 6 p.m. and then go to bed at 10 p.m. and wake up at 6 a.m., you have fasted for 12 hours. Being hungry after a 12-hour fast is normal! And while there’s nothing wrong with eating after dinner, limiting food in the hours before bed leads to better sleep and less indigestion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;What you eat is as big a factor as when you eat. “The type of food you eat at night definitely plays a role in how you feel the next morning,” says Rizzo. “If you eat a small meal that doesn’t have enough protein or fat, it won’t curb your appetite and can lead to extreme feelings of hunger that night or the next morning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Those hunger pangs first thing can also be the result of lack of sleep or a sign of dehydration, Dr. Reshmi Srinath, an endocrinologist for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, tells TODAY.com. Thirst is often mistaken for hunger, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If you’re routinely waking up hungry which, again, isn’t necessarily a bad thing, here are some other possible reasons, according to the experts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're taking a medication that increases appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You had a bowel movement overnight or late at night&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're exercising more than usual&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You consumed more alcohol than usual the night before&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does waking up hungry mean you have high cortisol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There are no studies showing that hormonal causes are contributing to morning hunger,” says Srinath, but it's a widely spread belief. Cortisol, the body’s stress hormone, naturally spikes in the morning. Like other hormones, cortisol levels rise with the sun and fall throughout the day leading to a slump around 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. and then sleepiness at night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While cortisol can impact day-to-day functioning if levels are especially high, Srinath says, there’s no correlation between the hormone and a.m. hunger.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does waking up hungry say about your metabolism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After a night of sleep, it might feel as if your last meal wasn’t all that long ago, but the hours you spend getting shuteye are enough to work up an appetite and break down the calories from the night before. If you’re waking up hungry, it’s likely not the result of a fast or high-functioning metabolism, the experts say, but a normal occurrence.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is waking up hungry a concern?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If waking up hungry is bothersome or especially distracting in the mornings, the experts suggest hydrating more, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-times-to-eat-rcna58563" target="_blank"&gt;timing your dinner later&lt;/a&gt; and incorporating more fiber and protein into your diet so that you’re more satiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If morning hunger accompanies headaches, lightheadedness, dizziness, brain fog or sweat, Adimoolam suggests a 15-gram serving of “fast-acting sugar” to get your blood sugar levels up and hold you over until breakfast. Some options she suggests include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon of sugar, honey or corn syrup&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4–6 ounces of juice or regular soda&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roughly 3–4 glucose tablets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 dose of glucose gel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Approximately 3 pieces of hard or gummy candies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Consider reaching out to a doctor, however, if you’re regularly hungry in the morning and your blood sugar falls below 70 mg/dL, says Adimoolam. Chronic low blood sugar can be associated with conditions including diabetes, kidney disease, malnutrition, adrenal insufficiency and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The same goes for hunger that disrupts your sleep. “If you wake up in the middle of the night and feel extreme hunger pangs in your stomach, there’s a good chance you aren’t eating enough,” adds Rizzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“This may happen when someone is trying to lose weight, but extreme hunger is never good for anyone. It’s fine to wake up hungry and be excited about eating breakfast. But if you’re waking up at 3 or 4 a.m. and feel like you could eat a huge meal, you may want to look at your overall eating patterns,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 17:04:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5NYmpFOGhlSzlSX3hOd0FCMmM1R2VKODVFcFYxQ0NJSzJFYkl0YjZ3bElTQTVrRU5oSEliaDlxOVdPSUpsMlJoQW54aWE2VzhHMmg2cTdaUzN5NHY3ck5lZU93bWVXeEpGdU02b2Y1LXDSAVRBVV95cUxNZUZOTTctUDRLdjlhd1ZvcEQzcTNTWjU1VnJucG51czh5WElHLXh4Mk00aGE5aWtFYTRRNU41LXZjWm1fXzBNdDdWeFpCV0JtNloyTjk</guid></item><item><title>Waking up hungry?

and has over 25 years of clinical research under her belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Bowring often takes to her TikTok to share her advice on longevity and staying healthy, and this time was no different, as she offered viewers four new pointers to keeping your body in tip-top shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Tip number one is to get out in the sun without sunblock on, without your sunglasses,' Dr. Bowring shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is so important to get natural sunlight exposure on as much of your body as possible to help prevent disease,' she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/benefits-sunlight#benefits"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;, getting outside and being in the sun is good for you, as it can boost your mood and Vitamin D levels, which is beneficial for bone health, immune function, and even muscle health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, per the&lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.aad.org/media/stats-sunscreen#:~:text=Dermatologists%20recommend%20using%20sunscreen%20on,not%20just%20during%20the%20summer."&gt; American Academy of Dermatology Association&lt;/a&gt;, it is important to wear sunscreen on the areas of your body that aren't covered by clothing when you go outside, as it can help to prevent sun damage and skin cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Next on Dr. Bowring's list was to get exposed to the cold, even if it may be uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Janine Bowring, a naturopath who is based in Canada and has over 25 years of clinical research under her belt, has revealed four daily hacks that can help you prevent disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'It is so important to get natural sunlight exposure on as much of your body as possible to help to prevent disease,' she said (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cold exposure, your cold showers, will help with your mitochondrial health,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It helps to give you more energy, and [it's] really important for longevity,' Dr. Bowring added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Per &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/6-cold-shower-benefits-consider"&gt;UCLA Health&lt;/a&gt;, cold showers can have a lot of benefits, like improving your circulation and reducing inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Bowring also advised people to limit their exposure to electromagnetic fields or electromotive force, also known as EMF, which emit from your phone while its in use, per &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet"&gt;National Cancer Institute.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recommended making sure your phone and Wi-Fi routers stay at a distance from you, especially when you're sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You gotta shut these things down so that you're preventing that mitochondrial DNA damage,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study published in November 2018 in the &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6250044/#:~:text=Numerous%20studies%20revealed%20the%20detrimental,main%20cause%20of%20EMF%20damage."&gt;National Library of Medicine &lt;/a&gt;'revealed the detrimental effects of EMFs from mobile phones, laptops, and other electric devices on sperm quality.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, Dr. Bowring told viewers that they should make sure that they are eating foods that are fresh and growing in the season and area where you live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She also recommended taking cold showers because they 'help with your mitochondrial health' (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Per &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://diet.mayoclinic.org/us/blog/2022/picked-at-their-peak-the-benefits-of-buying-seasonal-produce/"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, eating produce that is in season and 'picked at its peak' can be beneficial to your health, as the food will be packed with more nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is really important because sunlight imprints like a barcode on our food, based on that energy from the sun and we can better metabolize our foods if we're eating in the right season,' Dr. Bowring shared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the comments section of her video, many thanked her for the tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Love these tips, so simple yet not so obvious,' one person wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another agreed, 'Great list.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 17:01:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQOVVHVUExb2Uwdy1sNnR4cUJEZUxSZlo3LUNkMjYwdVlLMVF1aDJOY0lpdzB3NWVqME42TUltQnlpYkxESllHWDNMTnMxakVCUWZNQ3dfbVNOUEdQeXZIM3NkUXVTSHMyTndKVmlrMnFtZENzZVc0T2xiOF9OaUx5emdBcHlrTXV0X1o0WC1CNjBKakdYUEVHMXF6bkxoQdIBowFBVV95cUxOR2hSTFhKckVyYjQxRlF5YUJ4OFQzR1JqcW1VWGxFbWJHSUxndUlaMGhEbVRYVzk5empPOWEyLXlKamVTdmN0V2hXeXQtLUUwNWNTNm1LdDFRNXg1SkFLYzYyS2xqWkdZRHhldWlRM3J3azRIZjJYLUVNbVJPQ3lTZFV2V2U1YU9tNC1taWxQeXdGV3BqMWFlS2MxekNtOEZhWjcw</guid></item><item><title>Eating grapes every day can transform your body in a unique way - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxQQXlGUWlFRENMNmk3YjNOR1hWWnNhQjV3TEhDVXd0X2RuTG9KT1p3QUx3RkpFYUd3dk9BdEhlYVJWSmc3V3RGUkNaZkh3V1BqaXhfN0RfVHdZSGRTLTlXSVVaVEQ4VTFpRHRjeFpVemgyRXczclpJN1N0clZEVzROYk5scm4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle health plays a vital role in overall well-being, affecting strength, mobility, and longevity. While exercise and protein intake have long been the cornerstones of muscle maintenance, new research suggests that diet alone may have a powerful influence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study from Western New England University (WNE) has introduced an unexpected player in muscle health – grapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study reveals that consuming grapes daily could alter muscle gene expression, potentially enhancing strength and resilience. These findings offer a new perspective on how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/resveratrol-may-boost-female-fertility-naturally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;natural foods&lt;/a&gt; impact the body at a genetic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With millions of people struggling with age-related muscle loss, the potential benefits of grapes in maintaining muscle function are both exciting and significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exceeding-nutritional-benefits"&gt;Exceeding nutritional benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, people around the world consume approximately 30 million tons of grapes, making them one of the most widely eaten fruits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they are valued for their rich nutritional content, their health benefits extend well beyond basic nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific research has shown that grapes positively impact various aspects of health, including cardiovascular function, kidney health, and skin vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, grapes contain compounds that support eye health by protecting against oxidative stress, which can contribute to vision decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their role in gastrointestinal health is also noteworthy, as grapes promote digestion and contribute to a balanced gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their wide-ranging &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/muscles-defy-aging-with-remarkable-resilience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;health advantages&lt;/a&gt;, grapes have become more than just a tasty fruit – they are a natural source of essential compounds that support overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-grapes-change-muscle-genes"&gt;Grapes change muscle genes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this study, researchers have shed light on the dynamic influence daily grape consumption exerts on muscle gene expression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects are significantly more profound in females, which intriguingly brings male and female muscle characteristics closer to each other at a metabolic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genes tied to lean muscle mass showed an upward trend, while those related to muscle degeneration displayed a decline, pointing towards improved muscle function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These revelations open up potential pathways for tackling age-related &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-muscles-may-soon-be-able-to-regenerate-like-other-muscles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle&lt;/a&gt; loss, a challenge faced by 10-16% of elderly individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. John Pezzuto, senior investigator of the study, is the Dean of Pharmacy and Health Sciences at &lt;a href="https://wne.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Western New England University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides compelling evidence that grapes have the potential to enhance muscle health at the genetic level,” noted Dr. Pezzuto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given their safety profile and widespread availability, it will be exciting to explore how quickly these changes can be observed in human trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-grapes-affect-muscles"&gt;How do grapes affect muscles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fascinating field of nutrigenomics discusses the influence of diet on gene expression and the corresponding impact of genetic variation on dietary responses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined how daily intake of two servings of grapes impacted genetic expression patterns within muscle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the male and female muscles that usually exhibit significant differences converged into a unified phenotype under the grape-inclusive diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DNA of a single species, including humans, doesn’t vary notably from one individual to another. However, the primary factor that sets us apart is the expression of DNA, otherwise known as the phenotype. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ingestion of grapes brought about changes in the phenotypic gene expression of male and female muscle, predominantly in females, resulting in an aligned metabolic parameter between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another fascinating observation, specific genes linked with favorable muscle health – such as lean muscle mass – were enhanced. At the same time, genes associated with deteriorating muscle health were reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-research-directions"&gt;Future research directions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to conduct further studies to understand the specific biological processes responsible for these genetic changes in muscle function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also aim to determine how quickly these changes occur after regular grape consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By identifying the exact mechanisms behind this phenomenon, scientists can better assess how grapes contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-fuels-neuron-growth-through-muscle-signals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle health&lt;/a&gt; and whether their effects vary among different individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As nutrigenomics advances, this study represents a significant step toward developing new dietary strategies for maintaining muscle strength and preventing age-related decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future research confirms these findings, incorporating grapes into daily nutrition could become a practical and accessible way to support muscle health across all age groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study opens the door for a deeper exploration of how natural foods can positively influence the body at the genetic level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/14/4/695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 16:33:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQQXlGUWlFRENMNmk3YjNOR1hWWnNhQjV3TEhDVXd0X2RuTG9KT1p3QUx3RkpFYUd3dk9BdEhlYVJWSmc3V3RGUkNaZkh3V1BqaXhfN0RfVHdZSGRTLTlXSVVaVEQ4VTFpRHRjeFpVemgyRXczclpJN1N0clZEVzROYk5scm4</guid></item><item><title>Cutting Ultra-Processed Foods Leads to Weight Loss and Better Mood - Technology Networks</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxQY0VXX1FwRmozZjluVTBCa2RnWEF3YVN2NkY0MTF6UXptMlZISVJSNDhvVVhFaTlJLWZJZUc3eHlOT055NTM0QTBrR254b2xyd0hKaHdBSXNZek5iYjgtYmZ3VnJUcVlfSUdpVVRRaDRGeko4VHBfZkRNc0FYejN3c3FDdjNONjBKZnNHOFE0SlB2bDJTZTkzM3E1bGpQU1NRRmhYYlYtSzdhYmlsR1FrT2VGem5xNUoybGhadThSMG52Z0E1cWlNYTdn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_content_body_text" id="inner_content_body_text" data-content-id="396430"&gt;

In an 8-week trial, participants &lt;span data-start="1127" data-end="1157"&gt;cut UPF consumption by 50%&lt;/span&gt;, lost an average of &lt;span data-start="1178" data-end="1192"&gt;7.7 pounds&lt;/span&gt; and improved &lt;span data-start="1207" data-end="1233"&gt;mood and energy levels&lt;/span&gt;, showing potential for broader adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-start="1278" data-end="1302"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1282" data-end="1300"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul data-start="1303" data-end="1530"&gt;&lt;li data-start="1303" data-end="1368"&gt;&lt;span data-start="1305" data-end="1366"&gt;Participants reduced UPF intake by nearly 50% in 8 weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start="1369" data-end="1450"&gt;&lt;span data-start="1371" data-end="1448"&gt;Weight loss, lower sugar, sodium and saturated fat intake were observed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-start="1451" data-end="1530"&gt;&lt;span data-start="1453" data-end="1528"&gt;Mindfulness and household food environment played key roles in success.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1453" data-end="1528"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1453" data-end="1528"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most dietary programs are designed to help people achieve weight loss or adhere to U.S. nutrition guidelines, which currently make no mention of ultra-processed foods (UPFs). UPFs – like chips or candy – are the mass-produced, packaged products that contain little or no naturally occurring foods. Eating UPFs is &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/385/bmj-2023-078476" target="_blank"&gt;strongly associated with increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of diseases and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because almost no existing programs focus specifically on reducing UPF intake, researchers from Drexel University’s &lt;a href="https://drexel.edu/coas/" target="_blank"&gt;College of Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt; designed an intervention that included a variety of tactics to target the uniquely problematic aspects of UPFs, including being &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/well/eat/food-addiction-fat.html" target="_blank"&gt;engineered to be addictive&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to providing education about UPFs, the program integrated mindfulness and acceptance-based strategies, to help participants cope with cravings; one-on-one meal planning; a focus on improving the home food environment by involving a household member in the intervention; and financial support to help participants purchase healthy foods,&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/27/healthy-foods-are-often-more-expensive-heres-why.html" target="_blank"&gt; such as fresh fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; which can be more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently published in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/osp4.70029" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obesity and Science Practice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers tested a two-month intervention with 14 adults with overweight or obesity, who regularly ate UPFs (two UPF items per day). On average, participants successfully reduced their UPF intake by almost half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="featuredVendors"&gt;&lt;div class="featuredVendorInner"&gt;&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Want more breaking news?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subscribe to &lt;i&gt;Technology Networks&lt;/i&gt;’ daily newsletter, delivering breaking science news straight to your inbox every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.technologynetworks.com/subscribe-to-breaking-science-news" target="_blank" class="btn"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Subscribe for FREE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing UPF intake can be extremely difficult, because the food industry wants us to be hooked on UPFs,” said lead author &lt;a href="https://drexel.edu/coas/faculty-research/faculty-directory/psychology-well/faculty-core/hagerman-charlotte/" target="_blank"&gt;Charlotte Hagerman, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant research professor in the College. “The industry designs UPFs to be ultra-delicious, convenient, cheap, and constantly present in the U.S. — even if not directly in front of us, then on our TVs, phones, and roadside signs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hagerman noted that although the sample was small, the results of this intervention were very promising. By the end of the program, participants had reduced their UPF intake by almost half – both when measured as calories from UPFs and as the total number of UPFs consumed. Participants also reduced their calorie intake, on average by over 600 calories per day. Further, sugar consumption declined by 50%, saturated fat consumption declined by 37%, and sodium consumption declined by 28%. Participants also self-reported losing an average of 7.7 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, participants did not have meaningful increases in their fruit and vegetable consumption, suggesting that if we want to improve dietary intake more wholistically, we may need to more strongly encourage people to eat these foods,” said Hagerman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team highlighted that participants had highly positive feedback about the intervention and were enthusiastic about the benefits they noticed. During interviews, many reported that they experienced improvements in their mood and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the two-month intervention, the 14 participants worked with coaches with expertise in health behavior change at weekly group sessions that included one-on-one meetings, discussion and activities. Participants received education about identifying UPFs and their harmful effects, learned acceptance-based strategies for coping with the cravings and withdrawal of reducing UPFs and learned the importance of the household food environment for reducing UPF intake. Participants also had individual meal-planning sessions and financial support in the form of a $100 grocery store gift card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess their dietary intake, participants completed the &lt;a href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/asa24/" target="_blank"&gt;Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary Assessment Tool&lt;/a&gt; (ASA-24) to ask participants to report everything they ate over the past 24 hours. Before and after the intervention, participants reported everything they ate during two weekdays and one weekend day (since eating behavior tends to be different during the weekend). The assessment tool automatically reported servings of specific food groups (e.g., fruits), macronutrient intake, and calorie intake, to help the team and participants identify consumption patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A member of the research team categorized each entry as UPF or not and consulted with a UPF expert for a second opinion on ambiguous cases. Researchers were not aware of whether each entry was from before or after the intervention, to avoid biasing their coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data allowed the team to determine whether participants had significant changes in their UPF intake, sodium, added sugar, saturated fat, weight, and fruit/vegetable intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings suggest that people can reduce their ultra-processed food intake, if given the proper tools, and that they will be enthusiastic about interventions designed for this purpose,” said Hagerman. “The results also suggest that reducing UPF intake will lead to meaningful health improvements – such as weight loss and better mood – in as short as eight weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team plans to continue testing the intervention – on a larger sample, testing efficacy of the specific components of the intervention and testing on different populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reference: &lt;/b&gt;Hagerman CJ, Hong AE, Jennings E, Butryn ML.

It’s not too late for parents and kids to get a flu vaccine. It may very well prevent you or your loved ones from getting seriously ill. And, especially during flu season, it’s important to maintain good hand hygiene and to stay home if you are sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Flu activity usually peaks between December and February. In Ohio, flu activity has been increasing since early December and has increased more rapidly since the beginning of the year. Current activity is very high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Since the start of the season, more than 9,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations have been reported in Ohio, which is well above the five-year average for this time in the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Ohio generally reports between one and six influenza-associated pediatric deaths each season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Flu vaccines are available at most healthcare providers’ offices, local health departments, and retail pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Other effective ways to avoid getting or spreading the flu include washing hands frequently or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer, covering coughs and sneezes with tissues or coughing or sneezing into elbows, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;More information about flu and flu activity in Ohio is available at &lt;a href="https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2f7ictjwgbb.cc.rs6.net%2ftn.jsp%3ff%3d001pO1i2Z94ndg10KuGuLaOIqaB8jnw3cGg9GleFiUh8gpxfHzwtVOTSb0NOyaRyfpmjA_G4OdzUWo3SMu0owTEJjzj-oJ9SS1q96aqjbGRbmJ_1YgWyzV3PIAmjvy4mtRquTXJOIXG0Dy1n0NheSbvJQ%3d%3d%26c%3dIyQ5id0ovYGBbMvXOEtuQh1b1gmLQmhlTMwXAZojthhPBba-3hPymQ%3d%3d%26ch%3d2Saf57bG1wxS5ax94ZOXVk35L7ZCi_b22IYHumZO11xrxe6bGhNS8Q%3d%3d&amp;amp;c=E,1,zQtNkcFMzJ5emjK9bfD23yceskSwfffNeHhQngmbqnEPq7GLOx144dRRLyOCt0jj4G6Gjarp6-AlnF_tZMyWAVnBayhDnQmp86ir8dOqbehU&amp;amp;typo=1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;www.flu.ohio.gov&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.13abc.com/news/" target="_self"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Latest Local News&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.13abc.com/weather/" target="_self"&gt;&lt;b&gt;First Alert Weather&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.13abc.com/news/crime/" target="_self"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crime&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.13abc.com/news/national/" target="_self"&gt;&lt;b&gt;National&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.13abc.com/franchises/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;13abc Originals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="copyright |"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 WTVG.

&lt;p&gt;Some private schools have shut down because of a rapidly escalating measles outbreak in West Texas. Local health departments are overstretched, pausing other important work as they race to limit the spread of this highly contagious virus.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Since the outbreak &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-gaines-county-public-health-measles-vaccine/"&gt;emerged three weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;, the Texas health department has confirmed 90 cases with 16 hospitalizations, as of Feb. 21. Most of those infected are under age 18. Officials suspect that nine additional measles cases reported in New Mexico, across the border from the epicenter of the Texas outbreak in Gaines, are linked to the Texas outbreak. Ongoing investigations seek to confirm that connection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health officials worry they’re missing cases. Undetected infections bode poorly for communities because doctors and health officials can’t contain transmission if they can’t identify who is infected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is the tip of the iceberg,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer for &lt;a href="https://immunizeusa.org/"&gt;The Immunization Partnership&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, a nonprofit that advocates for vaccine access. “I think this is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An unknown number of parents may not be taking sick children to clinics where they could be tested, said Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas. “If your kids are responding to fever reducers and you’re keeping hydrated, some people may keep them at home,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most unvaccinated people will contract measles if they’re exposed to the airborne virus, which can linger for up to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/transmission.html"&gt;two hours&lt;/a&gt; indoors. Those infected can spread the disease before they have symptoms. Around &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html"&gt;1 in 5 people&lt;/a&gt; with measles end up hospitalized, 1 in 10 children develop ear infections that can lead to permanent hearing loss, and about 1 in 1,000 children die from respiratory and neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gaines has a large Mennonite population, which often shuns vaccinations. “We respect everyone’s right to vaccinate or not get vaccinated,” said Albert Pilkington, CEO of the Seminole Hospital District, in the heart of the county, in an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/at-the-epicenter-of-the-west-texas-measles-outbreak-one-hospital-in-gaines-county-works-towards-containment/"&gt;Texas Standard&lt;/a&gt;. “That’s just what it means to be an American, right?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Local health officials have been trying to persuade the parents of unvaccinated children to protect their kids by bringing them to pop-up clinics offering measles vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some people who were on the fence, who thought measles wasn’t something their kids would see, are recalculating and coming forward for vaccination,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Local health departments are also operating mobile testing units outside schools in an attempt to detect infections before they spread. They’re staffing clinics that can provide treatment prophylactically for infants exposed to the virus, who are too young for vaccination. Local health officials are advising day care centers on how to protect young children and babies, and educating school nurses on how to spot signs of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am putting 75% of my staff on this outbreak,” Wells said. Although Lubbock isn’t at the center of the outbreak, people infected have sought treatment there. “If someone infected was in the [emergency room], we need to identify everyone who was in that ER within two hours of that visit, notify them, and find out if they were vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Local health departments in rural areas are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7427223/"&gt;notoriously underfunded&lt;/a&gt;. Wells said the workload has meant pressing pause on other programs, such as one providing substance abuse education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zach Holbrooks, executive director of the South Plains Public Health District, which includes Gaines, said health officials were following CDC guidelines, as of last year, by advising schools to keep unvaccinated children home for 21 days if they shared a classroom or the cafeteria with someone infected. This means that many parents may need to stay home from work to care for their kids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot of private schools have closed down because of a high number of sick children,” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The burden of measles outbreaks multiplies as the disease spreads. Curbing a 2018 outbreak in Washington state with 72 cases &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/147/4/e2020027037/180774/Societal-Costs-of-a-Measles-Outbreak?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;cost about $2.3 million&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to $76,000 in medical costs, and an estimated $1 million in economic losses due to illness, quarantines, and caregiving.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health researchers expect such outbreaks to become larger and more common because of scores of laws around the U.S. — pending and recently passed — that ultimately lower vaccine rates by allowing parents to exempt their children from vaccine requirements at public schools and some private schools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such policies are coupled with misinformation about childhood vaccination now platformed at the highest levels of government. The new director of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has erroneously blamed vaccines for autism, pointing to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0310-248b"&gt;discredited theories&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-virology-092818-015515"&gt;shown to be untrue&lt;/a&gt; by more than a dozen &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa021134"&gt;scientific&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X14006367?via%3Dihub"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS postponed an important meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, without saying when it would resume. In addition, the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240408191802/https:/www.cdc.gov/measles/toolkit/state-health-departments.html"&gt;letter template to school principals&lt;/a&gt;, advising unvaccinated children to remain home from school for 21 days if they’ve been exposed to the measles virus, is no longer on the agency’s website. An old version remains &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/150924"&gt;posted on its archive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a rule, at least 95% of people need to be vaccinated against measles for a community to be well protected. That threshold is high enough to protect infants too young for the vaccine, people who can’t take the vaccine for medical reasons, and anyone who doesn’t mount a strong, lasting immune response to it. Last school year, the number of kindergartners &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm#T1_down"&gt;exempted from a vaccine&lt;/a&gt; requirement was higher than ever reported before, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Gaines, exemptions were far higher than the national average, approaching 20% in 2023-24. Gaines has one of the lowest rates of childhood vaccination in Texas. At a local public school district in the community of Loop, only 46% of kindergarten students have gotten vaccines that protect against measles. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amid an outbreak that displays the toll of measles in under-vaccinated pockets of America, Texas lawmakers have filed about 25 bills in this year’s legislative session that could limit vaccination further. Lakshaman said the public — the &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-january-2025/"&gt;majority of whom believe in the benefits&lt;/a&gt; of measles vaccination — should contact their representatives about the danger of such decisions. &lt;a href="https://immunizeusa.org/get-involved/"&gt;Her group&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.safecommunitiescoalition.org/"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; offer resources to get involved. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve got children winding up in the hospital, and yet lawmakers who’ve got their blinders on,” she said, referring to pending policies that will erode vaccination rates. “It’s just mind-blowing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"It was either accept those baby chicks, or over the next year, we slowly exit farming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Egg farmers are in the fight of our lives and we are losing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Though the avian flu, or H5N1, has circulated among American poultry flocks for years, an outbreak starting in 2022 has wreaked havoc on farms, killing over 156 million birds and sending egg prices skyrocketing. The virus then got a foothold among dairy cows last year, and this month, a different strain - tied to severe infections in humans - was found in the cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/739f/live/e0353080-efc6-11ef-99f8-e52313609a22.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/739f/live/e0353080-efc6-11ef-99f8-e52313609a22.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/739f/live/e0353080-efc6-11ef-99f8-e52313609a22.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/739f/live/e0353080-efc6-11ef-99f8-e52313609a22.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/739f/live/e0353080-efc6-11ef-99f8-e52313609a22.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/739f/live/e0353080-efc6-11ef-99f8-e52313609a22.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/739f/live/e0353080-efc6-11ef-99f8-e52313609a22.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/739f/live/e0353080-efc6-11ef-99f8-e52313609a22.jpg.webp" alt="Kreher Family Farms An aerial view of a farm in New York " class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 fxQYxK"&gt;Kreher Family Farms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;Mr Kreher and other farmers have had to implement a host of safety precautions to ensure their birds are safe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The worsening outbreak comes as President Donald Trump's new administration makes sweeping cuts to government staffing and research funding that public health experts say threatens the country's ability to respond to bird flu and other potential pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;This week, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) told the BBC it fired several officials who were working on the response to bird flu before trying to hire them back days later. The administration also promised billions in funding cuts to the National Institutes of Health, which scientists say could hamper research that helps them understand the evolution of viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Right now, the risk to most Americans remains low, but the virus is continuing to surprise us, and so that could change, and could change quickly," said Michaela Simoneau, a global health security fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I worry, as all of these funding cuts are in the political conversation, that we don't cut those programs that have been shown to be most essential."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Trump officials said they are working on a new plan to respond to bird flu, one that includes more safety precautions and vaccines while moving away from culling - a process where farmers kill all their birds after one flock becomes infected to prevent the spread of the highly contagious and fatal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;When asked for details about the new strategy, the White House did not provide specifics to the BBC, but said Joe Biden's administration had "crushed American agriculture with regulatory uncertainty", inflation and "radical environmental policies".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;Red flags as a virus mutates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Scientists have seen a number of warning signs in recent months that the avian flu is adapting to infect humans, said Andrew Pekosz, a molecular biology professor at Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Influenza viruses don't typically grow well in mammals, so the length of time the virus has circulated in dairy cows is concerning because it allows more opportunities to evolve, Mr Pekosz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Bird flu infected cattle for the first time ever in the US at the beginning of last year. Since then, there have been nearly 1,000 confirmed cases across 17 states. There also have been 68 confirmed cases among humans, most of whom worked closely with animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Then, in February, a new variant of the virus - called D1.1 - was detected in dairy cows and an infected worker in Nevada for the first time. The strain also caused two severe infections in humans in North America, a teenager in hospital in British Columbia and a patient in Louisiana who died from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The new variant also means there are now at least two instances in which cows have caught the virus from wild birds, and not other dairy herds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"We're seeing these little red flags, real signs that the virus is making some inroads," Mr Pekosz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The virus has upended poultry and dairy farms where workers have had to kill millions of birds to prevent more infections. It's a battle US consumers have felt at the grocery store and a recurring theme during the presidential campaign - in January, the average cost of eggs in the US rose more than 15% from a year ago, to $4.95 a dozen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Mr Kreher said that despite a host of security measures, including washing vehicles on farms, wearing steel-toed boots and using lasers to deter wild birds, the outbreak continues to worsen across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Bird flu "is on our minds from the moment we get up to the moment we sleep, if sleep comes", he said. "We need new strategies to fight this virus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;A new Trump strategy for farmers in crisis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;California poultry farmer Christian Alexandre has seen firsthand the financial and emotional devastation of a bird flu outbreak. In 2022, he had to kill all 45,000 of his chickens when the virus spread at his family farm near the Oregon border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It was extremely painful," said Mr Alexandre, president of the American Pastured Poultry Producers Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In response to soaring egg prices, Trump officials now say they want to move away from the slaughtering, focusing instead on preventative measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told the BBC's US partner CBS News last week that he is working on a plan with newly confirmed USDA leader Brooke Rollins to combat the virus "with biosecurity and medication".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Rollins and I have been working with all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world, to have a plan ready for the president next week," Hassett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Mr Alexandre said he was not sure that vaccinations and other precautions could replace the need to cull flocks - but he said new ideas were desperately needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"What farmers and the USDA have been doing has just obviously not worked," he said. "We're in a crisis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Vaccines for birds against the avian flu already exist in countries around the world, and last week, the USDA granted conditional approval to a new shot developed by Zoetis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Still, many poultry industry groups oppose vaccinating birds against the virus. This is because most countries don't accept exports of poultry that are vaccinated because of fears that it masks the presence of the virus, said Tom Super of the National Chicken Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Public health experts have been critical of the US government's response to bird flu since the virus first spread to dairy cows, arguing Biden officials fell short in their disease surveillance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But Trump's team has slowed communications about the disease, which also concerns public health experts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reportedly withheld weekly reports on bird flu and canceled weeks of briefings with lawmakers and state health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I haven't seen anything from this administration that would say that they're taking this outbreak any more seriously," Mr Pekosz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Ms Simoneau sees one encouraging sign from the Trump administration: Gerald Parker, a bird flu expert, veterinarian and former top-ranking health official, was chosen to lead the White House's Pandemic Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;At the same time, she said, the wide cuts and the decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization under Trump's leadership could hamper efforts to respond to H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"We're cutting ourselves off from that global information system at a time when we really need all of those signals that we can get," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Ms Simoneau said fatigue and a decrease in trust in public health officials following the Covid pandemic makes for a difficult environment for any administration to respond to a potential health crisis. But, she said, the threat is one Trump officials should take seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"We don't know if this could be an emergency for humans next week, or if it could be several months from now, or if it might not happen at all," Ms Simoneau said. "But taking your eye off the ball isn't really an option."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 16:10:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9vb3FYOUx1RXVsb3FrYXVOc1VkTlM0SjlSYV9PRW5Tb3Vsd1lVVkNuVnQyalZobl81cWdlUkJWR1l3bHVvQjdEMlplR2JkTGYyV0VNRVlzSEZnZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE5BeUkwTVJ3NUh3RV9rbUZ0d3VfaGdTNzNxdWhmVXZQTTJYSE5rSS1yNHZ5NldvZjNnSnU4QU5lVFpYQWVabXo2QUFwUUpTR3NaWXpRQ1JfWTI0dVVnMjZB</guid></item><item><title>We're Infectious Disease Experts.

Here’s what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bird flu does not spread human-to-human yet, but that could change rapidly. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that variants of H5N1 have been around since the 1990s and it has yet to evolve into a strain that could cause a human pandemic. That’s because of how the virus is currently spreading, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, there are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-01142025.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="no reports" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b605f8e4b06e2d4c97bdbf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-01142025.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;no reports&lt;/a&gt; of sustained human-to-human transmission associated with the current avian influenza strains circulating in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A majority of cases have been in farm workers. Schaffner said unless you work closely with dairy cattle or with poultry like chickens, your risk of catching bird flu right at this moment is “essentially zero.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Russo, chief of the infectious disease division at the University at Buffalo, said there is not “grounds for panic” yet for a human pandemic because of the virus’ current inefficiencies. He noted that the bird flu infections in humans have occurred primarily in individuals that have had close contact with poultry or dairy cows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;H5N1 “does not efficiently infect humans, you need a more prolonged contact, probably a much higher dose,” he said. “And equally importantly, if not more importantly, those individuals that get infected, it doesn’t transmit well from human to human.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“This virus is now demonstrating some of those hallmarks of a potential public health threat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Suresh Kuchipudi, veterinarian and chair of the infectious diseases and microbiology department at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this does not mean the threat of a bird flu pandemic could not happen in the near future. “It may never be able to do it, but we don’t want to rule out that possibility,” Russo said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said the avian influenza virus’ ability to infect so many different mammals ― including us ― is worrisome. Because the virus is now infecting multiple hosts simultaneously and continuously, “this virus is now demonstrating some of those hallmarks of a potential public health threat,” said Suresh Kuchipudi, a veterinarian and chair of the infectious diseases and microbiology department at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each time it gets into a new host, that could accelerate the changes in the virus for adaptation,” Kuchipudi continued. “The more frequently that happens, the chances of the virus ... learning the skill of infecting that host becomes higher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sustained human-to-human transmission could just take the virus “one or two” mutations and “could happen anytime,” Kuchipudi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one worst-case scenario, an animal like a pig could be infected both with bird flu and with human flu, and learn how to spread the virus better in what is known as “recombination,” Schaffner said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on top of the virus’ uncertain evolution, the federal public health infrastructure that is necessary for fighting against pandemics is also facing an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, President &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="announced" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b605f8e4b06e2d4c97bdbf" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; he was pulling the U.S. out of the World Health Organization, which coordinates global responses to pandemics.

It is believed that dairy workers got the H5N1 virus through infected milk splatters and “touching infected milking equipment and then rubbing their eyes,” Russo said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To combat this, personal protective equipment, such as high-quality, well-fitting masks, eye protection and gloves should be used when in contact with animals known to carry the virus.

&lt;p&gt;Results from four of the 11 children were &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02812-5/fulltext"&gt;published in The Lancet&lt;/a&gt; Feb. 21.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;Visual acuity—measured with a child-friendly, game-like touchscreen test—in treated eyes improved after four or more weeks, while the acuity in untreated eyes became unmeasurable, according to the published results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of treatment “extended outside the meaningful effects on vision and result in life-changing benefits in all areas of development including communication, behavior, schooling, mood, psychological benefits and social integration,” MeiraGTx's CEO Alexandria Forbes, Ph.D., said in the biotech's accompanying release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="t1-ad-slot" data-ad-slot-id="38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One child developed cystoid macular edema, a build-up of fluid, in their treated eye due to the therapy, researchers wrote in the article, which partially improved over time and didn’t prevent the child’s vision from improving. There were no other safety concerns, the scientists said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;Evercore ISI analysts described the findings as “strong clinical data with clear evidence of efficacy in a huge unmet need pediatric population.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As should be expected from a subretinal approach, safety was clean,” the analysts added in a Feb. 21 note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After positive conversations with the U.K.’s medicines watchdog, the firm now plans to submit the gene therapy, called rAAV8.hRKp.AIPL1, for expedited approval in that country, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MeiraGTx, which is headquartered in New York and has R&amp;amp;D and manufacturing in England, has also been in discussions with the FDA on how to pursue accelerated approval in the U.S., the company added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10" class="olytics_injection"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The therapy uses an adeno-associated virus to deliver functional copies of the AIPL1 gene and is injected once directly into the eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study began with four children between the ages of one and three who were born with severe retinal dystrophy associated with mutated copies of the AIPL1 gene. These children were each treated in one eye. After the researchers saw the treatment was safe and seemed to be working, they gave the gene therapy in both eyes of a further seven children.&lt;/p&gt;

"Ultra-processed food is driving the obesity epidemic. When we get President Trump back in the White House and me to Washington, we're going to fix our broken food system and Make America Healthy Again,” he said in an earlier X post. He has also pledged to remove ultra-processed foods from school lunches due to their potential link to cancer in young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods are typically high in unhealthy fats, refined sugars, sodium, and artificial additives, and often lack essential nutrients and fiber, making them detrimental to overall health. are linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, mental health disorders, diabetes, obesity, sleep problems, and even premature death, according to multiple researchers. Long-term studies suggest that diets high in processed foods increase the risk of chronic illnesses and reduce life expectancy. So, it's certain that they have to go from your diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the MAHA movement is leading efforts to reform the nation’s food system, here are some changes you can make in your homes.

You can swap them with some better choices instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of common &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/ultra-processed-foods-linked-with-buck-teeth-in-children-says-study/articleshow/117211464.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; you will easily find in the grocery store or supermarket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sweetened sodas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are loaded with sugar and artificial sweeteners, which significantly contribute to obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders. Though artificial sweeteners may seem like a healthier option, studies suggest they alter gut bacteria, increase cravings for sweet foods, and may even contribute to weight gain. Some research also links artificial sweeteners to an increased risk of metabolic disorders and digestive issues. Excessive consumption can also lead to dental issues and increased cravings for unhealthy foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong " data-ua-type="1"&gt;Processed meats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meats such as hot dogs, sausages, and deli meats contain nitrates, preservatives, and high sodium levels, which are linked to an increased risk of cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Kids’ breakfast foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the breakfast products like toaster patisserie, and sweetened cereals marketed as ‘healthy’ are actually high in sugar and artificial flavorings, leading to insulin resistance and weight gain over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Instant meals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though instant noodles and other ready-to-eat and make meals are convenient, they contain unhealthy preservatives, excessive sodium, and refined carbohydrates, which are linked to an increased risk of high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases. Processed foods typically contain unhealthy preservatives such as tertiary-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), which can have adverse health effects when consumed regularly. They are also loaded with excessive sodium, which can contribute to water retention, increased blood pressure, and a higher risk of hypertension. The presence of refined carbohydrates, which are stripped of essential nutrients and fiber, can lead to rapid spikes in blood sugar levels, increasing the likelihood of insulin resistance and metabolic disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Packaged snack cakes and pastries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercially produced bakery goods are highly processed and packed with refined flour, trans fats, and artificial additives. These sweet treats provide empty calories that spike blood sugar levels, leading to energy crashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="u strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Healthy alternatives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="u strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt; to ultra-processed foods &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Proteins &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of consuming processed meat, choose fresh meat, poultry, fish, and seafood. Add protein-rich beans, nuts, and seeds to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Whole grains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ditch the processed carbohydrates and instead purchase rice, oat,s and other whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dairy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose milk and unsweetened yogurts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fruit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of gulping sugary drinks, buy fresh or frozen fruit. Eat them as a whole, and occasionally make juices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Bradley Cooper Cooks Up Philly Pride For Super Bowl Attendees In New Orleans | WATCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Vegetables&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporate more vegetables into your diet.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweden's Viking Age population appears to have suffered from severe oral and maxillofacial disease, sinus and ear infections, osteoarthritis, and much more. This is shown in a study from the University of Gothenburg in which Viking skulls were examined using modern X-ray techniques.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, researchers published a report based on the examination of a large number of teeth from the Viking Age population of Varnhem in the Swedish province of Västergötland. Varnhem is known for its thousands of ancient graves and excavations of well-preserved skeletons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, odontologists at the University of Gothenburg have taken this research further, looking at not only teeth but also entire skulls, by using modern computed tomography, also known as CT scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Detailed image analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41405-025-00309-9" target="_blank"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;, presented in &lt;i&gt;BDJ Open&lt;/i&gt;, suggest that the 15 individuals whose skulls were examined suffered from a broad range of diseases. The CT scans show pathological bone growths in the cranium and jawbone, revealing infections and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several individuals showed signs of having suffered from sinus or ear infections that left traces in the adjacent bone structures. Signs of osteoarthritis and various dental diseases were also found. All the skulls came from adults who died between 20 and 60 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study lead, Carolina Bertilsson, is an assistant researcher at the University of Gothenburg and a dentist within Sweden's Public Dental Service. The study was performed with specialists in dental radiology at the University of Gothenburg and an archaeologist from Västergötlands museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, they conducted the examinations and analyzed the images. CT scans provide &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/three-dimensional+images/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;three-dimensional images&lt;/a&gt; that enable researchers to study in detail the various types of skeletal damage, layer by layer, in the different parts of the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/skull/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;skull&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Greater understanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There was much to look at. We found many signs of disease in these individuals. Exactly why we don't know. While we can't study the damage in the soft tissue because it's no longer there, we can see the traces left in the skeletal structures," says Bertilsson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The results of the study provide a greater understanding of these people's health and well-being. Everyone knows what it's like to have pain somewhere, you can get quite desperate for help. But back then, they didn't have the medical and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/dental+care/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dental care&lt;/a&gt; we do, or the kind of pain relief—and antibiotics—we now have. If you developed an infection, it could stick around for a long time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is described as a pilot study. One important aspect was to test CT as a method for future and more extensive studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Very many of today's archaeological methods are invasive, with the need to remove bone or other tissue for analysis. This way, we can keep the remains completely intact yet still extract a great deal of information," says Bertilsson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Costco seems to have everything a homeowner could possibly need. Whether you're on the hunt for &lt;a href="https://www.housedigest.com/1764984/costco-affordable-dinnerware-kitchenware/" target="_blank"&gt;affordable dinnerware and kitchenware&lt;/a&gt; or shopping for bulk inexpensive food items your household always plows right through, the Costco warehouse is always filled to the brim with opportunity. And, this newest viral product is further proof that the supermarket has the answer to every home issue; Costco's &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/thomasville-dillard-accent-chair-with-storage-ottoman.product.4000180371.html" target="_blank"&gt;Thomasville Dillard accent chair with storage ottoman&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable, cozy piece of furniture that will add storage and style to any room.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accent chair has over 600 five-star reviews on Costco's site, with users lauding its comfort, affordability, and storage. "This chair makes my living room look cozy and very classy," one Costco buyer wrote, adding that it's "very comfortable, and the extra storage space is a plus." Another reviewer chimed in: "I love that it has springs and not just foam. It's nice to curl up in and watch TV or read." Some shoppers warned that the chair is heavier than they expected, but Costco will typically assist shoppers with delivery and setup: "They delivered and set up free which was helpful to me as I'm a senior," one reviewer wrote. It retails for $599.99 but is part of the &lt;a href="https://www.housedigest.com/1770010/what-is-costco-direct-how-to-use-benefits/" target="_blank"&gt;Costco Direct program, which you can use to your advantage&lt;/a&gt; and save money on this purchase if you bundle it with other items. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="news-article"&gt;
                
                &lt;h2 class=""&gt;How to style the Thomasville Dillard accent chair&lt;/h2&gt;
                                
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the few gripes that Costco buyers had about this chair was its lack of color options. The light grey coloring can feel limiting, and it's also hard to fully get an idea of the color with just online photos. One reviewer described it as "a mix of grey and white, more on the warm side but not super warm toned." Another shopper called the chair "a very light grey that ... can match any style." With this input, it's safe to assume that the chair will fit in well with any gray tones, and will especially &lt;a href="https://www.housedigest.com/1740641/best-wall-paint-colors-complement-gray-floors/" target="_blank"&gt;complement gray floors&lt;/a&gt;. Try painting a matching accent wall, then get bookshelves to complete your reading nook, and fill them up with colorful books behind the chair. This is how Instagram creator That's My Bookshelf styled the piece in her home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if your space is more about earth tones, you can treat this chair as you would any white piece of furniture. Consider swapping the three gray pillows for your own colorful throw pillows that match other components of your living room, or placing a vibrant throw blanket on the arm to give it a pop of color. If the chair seems to be taking up too much space in your living room, you can move the ottoman to another place in your house, as it easily doubles as a storage bench that would be perfect in kids' playrooms or at the foot of a bed. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/article&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of California, Los Angeles researchers have discovered that chronic stress flips brain activity between two amygdala-striatal pathways, disrupting flexible decision-making and promoting inflexible habits.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The research identifies distinct roles for the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/basolateral+amygdala/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;basolateral amygdala&lt;/a&gt;–dorsomedial striatum (BLA→DMS) and central amygdala–dorsomedial striatum (CeA→DMS) circuits in action-outcome learning and habit formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress impairs goal-directed decision-making, often leading to rigid, habitual behaviors that underpin several psychiatric conditions. Understanding the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neuronal+circuits/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neuronal circuits&lt;/a&gt; involved could illuminate vulnerabilities in disorders like substance use, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/obsessive-compulsive+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;obsessive-compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt;, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "A dual-pathway architecture for stress to disrupt agency and promote habit," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08580-w" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, researchers used a systems neuroscience approach in male and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/female+mice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;female mice&lt;/a&gt; to uncover the underlying &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt; mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic mild unpredictable stress was induced through pseudo-random unexpected exposure to stressors, including damp bedding, cage tilting, white noise, continuous illumination, physical restraint, and footshock over 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;While the intentionally mild stress level did not produce pronounced anxiety or depression-like phenotypes in classic tests, blood corticosterone levels were elevated, and body weight decreased in stressed mice compared to controls, confirming stress induction. Controls received handling only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohorts underwent short training sessions in which lever presses earned food pellets. Fiber photometry recorded neuronal signals in distinct amygdala–striatal projections. Optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations pinpointed how these circuits control goal-directed learning or habit formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral assessments involved lever-press tasks under random-ratio and random-interval reinforcement schedules. Outcome-specific devaluation and contingency degradation tests measured action-outcome learning and habit formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control mice reduced lever pressing when the reward was devalued, indicating preserved agency. Stressed mice displayed insensitivity to devaluation, indicating disrupted action-outcome learning and premature habit formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal activity in BLA→DMS and CeA→DMS pathways were recorded using fiber photometry. BLA→DMS projections were activated by rewards during learning in control mice but suppressed in stressed mice, disrupting action-outcome associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, CeA→DMS projections, typically inactive during &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/early+learning/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;early learning&lt;/a&gt;, became progressively engaged following stress, facilitating habit formation.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations further clarified these pathways' functions. Inhibiting BLA→DMS activity during learning in unstressed mice disrupted agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activating BLA→DMS projections during learning restored agency in stressed mice. In contrast, inhibiting CeA→DMS projections during learning prevented stress-induced habits, while activating this pathway in mildly stressed mice promoted habit formation. Neither manipulation affected instrumental learning acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings reveal that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt; diminishes BLA→DMS-mediated flexible decision-making and recruits CeA→DMS circuitry to promote inflexible habits. These results highlight the amygdala's dual influence on the dorsomedial striatum in balancing goal-directed and habitual behaviors under stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also suggests that stress-induced vulnerabilities to compulsive behaviors, including those linked to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/substance+use/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;substance use&lt;/a&gt; and other psychiatric conditions, might have targetable brain circuitry for therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

It causes fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea and vomiting, and can be fatal in severe cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only two patients in the US have ever tested positive for MERS - both in May 2014 -and each case was linked to travel from the Middle East. There is no vaccine against the virus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Merbecoviruses have been detected in minks and pangolins - the animal believed to be the intermediary for Covid between bats and humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, the scientists wrote, 'suggests frequent cross-species transmission of these viruses between bats and other animal species.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added: 'This study reveals a distinct lineage of HKU5-CoVs in bats that efficiently use human [cells] and underscores their potential zoonotic risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HKU5-CoV viruses were first detected in bats in 2006, but the new data suggests HKU5-CoV-2 has a 'higher potential for interspecies infection' than others.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the potential for HKU5-CoV-2 to spill over to humans 'remains to be investigated.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research was conducted by the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/wuhan/index.html" id="mol-21275be0-f067-11ef-983a-d59410a7a5f9"&gt;Wuhan&lt;/a&gt; Institute of Virology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The WIV is at the center of the lab-leak theory, which claims &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13220019/probe-covid-origins-lab-leak.html"&gt;Covid-19 was manufactured in a Chinese lab&lt;/a&gt; and accidentally leaked to the public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The newest study states a zoonotic spillover is believed to be responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic as bats have the highest proportion of coronaviruses and are considered reservoirs for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bats have the highest proportion of coronaviruses and are considered reservoirs for them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while SARS and MERS have documented evidence of transmission between animals to humans, the 'intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study claiming to support the Covid-19 zoonotic theory is a 2023 report published &lt;span&gt;in the journal Nature and led by virus expert Ralph Baric of the University of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;North Carolina. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It found the strain of coronavirus harbored in pangolins, endangered animals in China that are sometimes consumed by humans, was nearly identical to the Covid-19 virus that caused the pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This has led some scientists to theorize the first cases of Covid-19 likely jumped from the animals to immunocompromised humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This gave the novel virus ample opportunity to mutate and replicate until it reached its full pandemic potential. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, another camp of scientists insist the pandemic was sparked by a lab leak. This theory, subscribed to by some US federal agencies, posits Covid-19 was manufactured in a lab and accidentally escaped, which set off the pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a 2018 research proposal, which was ultimately denied funding and did not go forward, saw scientists seeking to create a novel virus that had four characteristics matching features of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One study claiming to support this theory was conducted in 2024 by researchers from Australia and Arizona.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They used a risk analysis tool - which they described as the most comprehensive yet - to determine the chances the SARS-CoV-2 virus was of 'unnatural' or 'natural' origin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team compared the characteristics of the virus and the pandemic to 11 criteria that analyzed things like the rarity of a virus, the timing of a pandemic, the population infected, the spread of a virus and the unexpected symptoms of a virus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based on the nature of Covid, researchers assigned a score to each category - less than 50 percent meant the pandemic would be classified as a natural outbreak, but 50 or more percent would mean the pandemic was an unnatural outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid received a score of 68 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 15:23:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxPYjNTT0JYWXAtQlZpYi05cXhBU01rd3Rwc182b2tpVWM1b0cySy1vU21iRFZWdFpvTGNFX2NDZl94OThqY2xQdS1Wb2p5dUxiak81TnZSelFteEk3UHBWMFoxZ0tmT0VUcG5JQ3IzMXNvTms2Ni1jNDk0YzI5LWRSYzd6clVpX21IU3J6akhTZkwzREs5RkZpQTc3bUNTNS1oTmRtRkJPSWN1emhXOXF30gG0AUFVX3lxTE1adTZ4anNnNVBXekluRlNsMjBta1h4V2pjc05KWWpfc2RWaWNsSGtEVVBiT2JNZzBzWkVVTkpYcjNiNTQ5TmJxbjJOLUdtcGczYVIwVWRNWWlES2ZzdVg0ZEt1YlVDV1MzT3RTTGxXLXd2NTJQT0xvZ0N6dDB4d2tRMW43SWlJSkdlbHc4R1VDdFpPdGUyVFVBeFg4R050eUp4SWROMXVqdTZMQjU2VkI1UmthVg</guid></item><item><title>Woman's Unwelcome Souvenir From Trip: a Brain Worm - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOd01ZX0VqdElnTkhISy1Dd2ZlQ2dXT1FWZFZLZVpQb1U2MnNVaEt4UEUyODZIUDNwM3h5ZW1RUVE1RUNObGJDNnJwSmdhN2Nmd1JObk5mSXJpODY0Q1I3SWhPVjFkNEdpNVh2LVJPcFo0X1FrRU9ZOFc1VzZZUTVFOG4wOGNvU2tXZ2V3RVVCNWdnN3ZSTmFHRmVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;

                                        A woman on a whirlwind three-week junket to Hawaii, Japan, and Thailand returned home with an unwanted memento: a parasite that embedded itself in her brain and made her legs feel like they were burning. That odd sensation started out in the New England 30-year-old's feet after she got back from her travels, per a case study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412514"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Concerning spread: &lt;/strong&gt;Soon, that sensation had spread to the woman's legs, which had become very sensitive, and she began feeling run-down, though she thought that fatigue was just jet lag. The woman went to the ER, but tests found nothing amiss and she was sent home.

Measles is caused by the morvillivirus, which can lead to serious health complications, especially in children under 5 who aren’t vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Measles is a great exploiter of unvaccinated individuals," Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, told Yahoo News. "If you have a significant population that has not been vaccinated, then measles can rip through those populations very quickly because it's one of the most highly transmissible virus agents we know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-does-measles-spread"&gt;How does measles spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is spread through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes or talks. It’s so contagious that nine out of 10 people exposed to the virus will get infected if they have not been vaccinated, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#cdc_disease_basics_causes_risk_spread-how-it-spreads" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles "has a reproductive number of between 12 and 18," Hotez explained. "It means a single individual can, on average, infect another 12 to 18 unvaccinated individuals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Airborne droplets of the virus can remain in a room for two hours, even after the person with measles has left the room, according to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8584-measles" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.

However, that can change as we age because we're at an increased risk for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2682456/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;low vitamin consumption&lt;/a&gt;, partly because our bodies can no longer effectively absorb certain nutrients. So if you're dealing with deficiencies, are on specific medications or have particular health conditions, your doctor may advise you to take certain supplements to make sure your body has all the nutrients it needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;These are the top six vitamins and minerals that doctors recommend you focus on for healthy aging. Just be sure to talk to your doctor first before adjusting your diet or trying new supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is a mineral that provides several key functions in the body. It keeps your muscles strong, regulates blood sugar levels and contributes to heart health. &lt;a href="https://www.vitality101.com/about-dr-teitelbaum" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internist in integrative medicine, told us that "magnesium is critical for well over 300 reactions in the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said an unprocessed diet has about 600 mg of magnesium daily, but the average American diet has less than 250 mg of magnesium after processing. For reference, the daily recommended amount of magnesium is &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/are-you-getting-enough-magnesium" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;400 to 420 mg per day for adult men&lt;/a&gt; and 310 to 320 mg for women, but more is needed for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum warned that the effects of low magnesium may include an &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.105.588327" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased risk of metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. This can lead to heart attacks, strokes and dementia. You may also feel exhausted or experience widespread muscle pain if you're not getting enough magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find magnesium in a wide range of ingredients. &lt;a href="https://fatlotofgood.com.au/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Dr. Peter Brukner&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist sports and exercise physician, said you can find magnesium in nuts, seeds, whole grains and leafy green vegetables like spinach. In extra yummy news, you can also get magnesium from dark chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some older adults or those who take specific medicines (such as diuretics or drugs for acid reflux) may not receive enough magnesium from their diet and might need &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/5-best-magnesium-supplements/" target="_self"&gt;a supplement&lt;/a&gt;," he said. "However, too much magnesium can cause stomach issues, so be careful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. B vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Laurie Ambrose/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also need a range of B Vitamins, including B12 and folate (also called folic acid), to maintain your health as you age. Vitamin B-12 works with folate to help your body make new cells, including blood cells and nerve cells. While you don't usually require more B12 as you age, your &lt;a href="https://aging.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nutrition-Needs_Vitamin-B12_FINAL-2.18.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;body cannot absorb it as well&lt;/a&gt; when you get older. Brukner said this is because "stomachs make less acid, and this acid is necessary to take the vitamin from food into the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum said B vitamins are critical for energy production, and suboptimal levels can affect your health. He warns that B vitamin deficiency has been associated with "a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8079632/#s5" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;marked increase of dementia&lt;/a&gt; (especially folic acid) and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379715000732" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased risk of heart attack and stroke&lt;/a&gt; (especially in those with elevated homocysteine levels)." Symptoms of B12 deficiency include weakness or poor balance, loss of appetite and numbness and tingling in the hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B12 is found in animal proteins like meat, fish and eggs. Brukner said that if you don't eat these foods, you may want to turn to foods like cereals and nutritional yeast with added B12. "Older people, especially those having certain stomach issues or taking medicine that lowers stomach acid, might need to take a B12 vitamin supplement," he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amelia-ti/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Amelia Ti&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in New York City, who is also part of CNET's medical review board, adds that people taking medicine that blocks B12 absorption, like omeprazole or metformin, may also need a vitamin B12 supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Calcium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institute on Aging says that calcium is especially important for &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/vitamins-and-supplements/vitamins-and-minerals-older-adults#calcium" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;older people at risk for bone loss&lt;/a&gt;. The Institute recommends 1,000 mg each day for men between the ages of 51 and 70, and 1,200 mg per day for men 71 and older. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-vitamins-for-women-50-plus/" target="_self"&gt;Women aged 51 and up&lt;/a&gt; are recommended to take 1,200 mg each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Calcium is well-known for making bones strong, but it is also crucial for muscles to work right," Brukner said. "As people become older, their bodies take in less calcium from food, which can cause bones to become weaker." You can get calcium naturally from sources like milk, yogurt and cheese. The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health notes that &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/calcium/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;calcium is also available&lt;/a&gt; in kale, salmon, tofu, almonds and spinach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for supplements, Brukner said, "If you are at risk for bone troubles or don't get enough calcium in your food, taking supplements might be useful. But too much calcium can cause other issues like kidney stones, so talk with your doctor first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Malorny/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is often called the sunshine vitamin because you typically absorb it through the skin just by being outside. However, during winter months, if you live in a cloudy climate or avoid natural sunlight as you age, you may not get enough. Your body &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/vitamin-d-supplements-explained-who-should-take-them/" target="_self"&gt;needs vitamin D to properly absorb calcium&lt;/a&gt;, making it an important nutrient for bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brukner says that in addition to sunshine, you can get vitamin D from fatty fish like salmon and mackerel, fortified milk and cereals. Your doctor may also recommend a supplement if you're experiencing bone loss or at risk of osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to bone health, Teitelbaum said vitamin D can help you fight off disease. He said, "Suboptimal vitamin D is associated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6047889/#S8" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased autoimmunity,&lt;/a&gt; higher risk of severe infectious diseases (&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/supplements-white-house-advisor-fauci-takes-every-day-to-help-keep-his-immune-system-healthy.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Dr. Fauci noted that he took vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID pandemic) and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3440651/#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20deficiency%20has%20been,it%20a%20potential%20risk%20factor." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Omega-3s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are essential to many of your body's functions. They play a role in both heart and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/multivitamins-memory-and-aging-everything-to-know/" target="_self"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;. However, as Cleveland Clinic points out, your body &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;isn't able to produce enough omega-3s on its own&lt;/a&gt;. This means you need to get more from &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/reap-the-benefits-of-omega-3s-with-these-heart-healthy-foods/" target="_self"&gt;the foods you eat&lt;/a&gt; or supplements you take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Omega-3 fatty acids are very good for heart health and can help lessen swelling, which is important for older people," Brukner explained. "They are also beneficial for brain well-being and might help guard against memory loss and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4019002/#:~:text=More%20than%20a%20dozen%20epidemiological,as%20Alzheimer's%20disease%20(AD)." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;diseases such as Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;." Ti adds that omega-3s help lessen swelling by reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish like salmon are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. Brukner said you can also turn to flaxseeds, chia seeds and walnuts but added a warning: "These give a different type of omega-3 that the body does not use so easily." Fish oil and algae oil can also serve as supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Zinc&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/pba.v5.25592" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;2015 paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in Pathobiology of Aging and Age-related Diseases, calls zinc an "essential micronutrient for human health in general, and particularly for the elderly." The authors say zinc plays "an important role in the aging process" and that zinc deficiency may be connected to several age-related chronic illnesses, which include hardening of the arteries, degenerative diseases of the nervous system, age-related changes to the immune system and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we get older, our immune system becomes weaker, and if we don't have enough zinc, this can make it even worse," Brukner explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find zinc in shellfish, red meat, poultry, beans, nuts and seeds. Brukner said oysters are particularly zinc-rich. He added, "Some older people might find zinc supplements helpful, especially if they often get sick or do not eat enough foods high in zinc. But taking too much zinc can cause problems with other minerals in the body, so it's important to follow advised amounts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating well can help boost your bones, immune system and more as you age. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/pumping-iron-is-key-for-healthy-aging-heres-how-to-start/" target="_self"&gt;Along with exercise&lt;/a&gt; and other good habits, getting the right minerals and vitamins may improve your health. Try to get enough magnesium, B vitamins, calcium, vitamin D, omega-3s and zinc in your diet each day. Talk to your doctor before you take any supplements to find out how they may interact with your existing medications and health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPTHluRTZnQngwdlF0OEpHdGRLWlVENkZaTW1mODFWWUxCOEVRbzhWUmNlTXBuNll0Y3A4RUJWalYzQzNPbjI0cVRaN2c4Rk4zQVNIVEk5ZF9GbjJXWXkyMzEtV3JyX1puQXhINDJiWG9xOGV5Q3BCdHhiQnp1YUFDYzluZkVKZnpNLUF1MERRUWduV3BhMndsblpFSDlmM1NHV0Z0eU9IWUFPSFUyUzBxdVFWQ3U</guid></item><item><title>Ohio reports first pediatric flu death of the season - WKBN.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQaHZ3ZTM2M1d4Q2pUcFNTY0ZzRU9qakxJZXB1V29TUVkxSDVmaklBSVRjRWI0SzhPcjBDWUw1cGhYU0pXUWgzUW9kU2hMa3lmUTNjcjEtSGNFa0tqUmdkazhURENNWXloOXFTUzNEWXdENU1lOWlPVWN6cEgxMXpRcG9ZdFl2aGJUb0ZGQdIBkgFBVV95cUxPUFJrUFNlNGRaVG1jNzRKUkMyV2pYNW53QllFVnBaZmdCdFRwV3BZZi1yUS1RWFExRnRQY0dYSHphTTJacEM5QVJncnNjeDZMU2F0Rmwwb1o5bzFCQzJRNW1nZVRoNzFOTWh4aHFGdVpjT21XTmR0ZElHelBJN0QwLVJEUTRrczJTRDV5YkhKUUMyQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the American South was crawling with intestinal hookworms. Some initial surveys in the 1930s suggested nearly 54 percent of the population was infected, with prevalence in some areas as high as 76 percent. Through concerted deworming efforts and improved hygiene, the worms were largely flushed out over the subsequent decades. But as one medical editorial put it in 2017: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5817787/"&gt;We still got 'em&lt;/a&gt;. That year, a study detected genetic traces of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/97/5/article-p1623.xml?tab_body=fulltext"&gt;N. americanus in the stool of more than a third of people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; tested in an impoverished community in Lowndes County, Alabama. In Lowndes, approximately 50 percent of households have failing or no sewage systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creeping eruption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that's something you can enjoy thinking about before bed tonight, let's not forget that there's a second category of hookworms: the ones that bore into your body &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/zoonotichookworm/index.html"&gt;but generally don't make it into your intestines&lt;/a&gt;. This may seem like the better scenario than the intestinal group. But, that's only the case if you're ok with hookworm larvae wandering aimlessly through the layers of your skin, leaving an intensely itchy, serpentine rash, marked by redness and little pus-filled blisters in their wake. The rash is called cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), or "creeping eruption."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second type of invasion is borne from worm-infested animals. The pack of parasites that cause CLM in people include hookworms that infect dogs and cats (&lt;em&gt;Ancylostoma caninum, A. braziliense&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Uncinaria stenocephala&lt;/em&gt;), and in rarer cases cattle (&lt;em&gt;Bunostomum phlebotomum&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In animals, these hookworms live out a life cycle much like the intestinal cycle described earlier, with the parasites making themselves at home in the animals' small intestines. But, in humans, the worms find a dead-end. Most never make it out of the skin, roaming randomly until their death, which, without treatment, can take about five to six weeks. In their desperate meandering, some larvae—which measure 500 to 600 micrometers (0.05 to 0.06 centimeters) long—will travel several centimeters each day. Others can make it into deeper tissue, but become stuck. On occasion, &lt;em&gt;A. caninum&lt;/em&gt;—which normally infect dogs—have been known to make it to the intestines and partially develop. But they never complete their life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breast cancer: Even “a little” might be too much&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Breast cancer is the most &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/info-2024/breast-cancer-disparities.html" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/cancers-linked-to-alcohol.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP.

Within that massive number is another: About 16 percent, or more than 44,000 cases of breast cancer, &lt;a data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/cancers-linked-to-alcohol.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP.

A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" data-displayoverlay="displayOverlay" title="breast cancer and alcohol" rel="noreferrer" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21858" target="_blank"&gt;are attributed to alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, according to a 2024 research review published in the American Cancer Society’s flagship journal &lt;i&gt;CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Research consistently finds that alcohol can alter or raise hormone levels, including estrogen. Higher levels of the hormone can lead to mutations in breast tissue that cause cancer. “Even drinking within the guidelines, so one a day for women,” can increase the risk of developing breast cancer, LoConte says.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Put another way, research finds about 11 out of every 100 women who consume less than one alcoholic beverage will develop breast cancer in their lifetime, as noted in the Surgeon General’s advisory. Two more than that, or 13 in every 100 women, who have one drink a day, and 15 in 100 women who have two drinks per day, will develop breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;Of course, drinking is but one prominent risk factor that could raise a woman’s risk of developing cancer. Many others, starting with age, obesity, genetics/family history and environmental exposures (to radiation, for example), can also stack the deck against a person. Doctors encourage &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/info-2023/mammogram-guidelines-breast-cancer-screening.html" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/cancers-linked-to-alcohol.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="breast cnacer screenings"&gt;considering all risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;“If you’re a postmenopausal woman and there is a reason why your risk is higher than normal for breast cancer,” it’s important to factor that in when choosing whether to drink — and how much to drink, says William Dahut, M.D., chief scientific officer for the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouth, throat and esophageal cancers: The “dose-dependent” dangers of drinking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Although head and neck cancers aren’t as common as breast cancer, the alcohol-related risk of developing these cancers is more pronounced and increases more sharply the more a person drinks.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;That risk is present even when a person stays within the recommended limit, which is two drinks per day for men (and, again, one drink per day for women), LoConte says. She recommends abiding by those guidelines at a minimum, “but really getting as low as comfortable” is ideal, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;LoConte was the lead author of a 2018 statement on &lt;a data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/cancers-linked-to-alcohol.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP.

A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" data-displayoverlay="displayOverlay" title="alcohol and cancer" rel="noreferrer" href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2017.76.1155" target="_blank"&gt;alcohol and cancer&lt;/a&gt; by the American Society of Clinical Oncology that outlined those “dose-dependent” relationships between total alcohol consumption and rates for certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;Heavy drinkers — which the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines as men who consume five or more drinks on any day or 15 drinks or more per week, and women who have four or more drinks on any day or eight or more per week — developed oral cavity (mouth) and pharynx (throat) cancers and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma at around five times the rate of non-drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;A predominant cause of these and other alcohol-related cancers (and a contributor to breast cancer) is a byproduct of the body’s breakdown of alcohol called acetaldehyde, which can damage DNA. Once damaged, cells can grow out of control and turn into tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
            
        &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.realitytea.com/tag/dolores-catania/"&gt;Dolores Catania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is always trying to look better. &lt;a href="https://www.realitytea.com/show/real-housewives-of-new-jersey/"&gt;The Real Housewives of New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; has had &lt;a href="https://www.realitytea.com/2024/11/04/dolores-catania-reveals-recent-cosmetic-procedure-rhonj/"&gt;numerous cosmetic procedures&lt;/a&gt;. She also &lt;a href="https://www.realitytea.com/2024/05/06/dolores-catania-on-ozempic-use-no-shame-in-it-rhonj/"&gt;takes Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt;, after finding it a better match for her body than Ozempic. As such, the RHONJ star lost a noticeable amount of weight. But after incorporating a fitness overhaul, Dolores may be done with the Type 2 diabetes drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As with any medication, one has to weigh the benefits and side effects. Dolores also discussed the matter with her doctor. The Bravolebrity shared the advice her care provider gave her, and what she decided to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dolores-catania-continues-to-be-honest-about-her-medication-use"&gt;Dolores Catania continues to be “honest” about her medication use&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;

News" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SsZuHCxELi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dolores hailed her Mounjaro experience as a “life-changer” during a recent interview with &lt;a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/811942/rhonj-dolores-catania-gets-real-about-the-menopause-and-marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hello! magazine&lt;/a&gt;. Her boyfriend, &lt;a href="https://www.realitytea.com/tag/paul-connell/"&gt;Paul Connell&lt;/a&gt; also got on board and lost 60 pounds. Needless to say, the results were “positive” for both RHONJ stars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I kind of think I broke the seal on being honest about it,” Dolores said of her history with the trendy weight loss drug. “With Ozempic, it has been a life-changer for me and my boyfriend, Paul, who lost 60 pounds. He no longer takes a certain blood pressure medication and it’s been really positive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She continued, “I personally like it. I know it’s time for me to wean myself off or go on a lower dose but doctors have said there’s not really anything wrong with staying on it. You must always go through a real doctor, though, who knows what they are doing. Research is everything.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So Dolores got the green light to stay on the medication. If she does lower the dose, or go off it completely, it will be her decision. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a prior interview with &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tv/11168012/rhonj-dolores-catania-paul-connell-transformation-weight-ozempic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Sun&lt;/a&gt;, Dolores went into more detail about how she became more dedicated to her workouts. The reality TV star and Paul hit the gym “three to for times a week.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I hate working out, but it’s starting to feel good to me,” she admitted. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Watch &lt;a href="https://www.bravotv.com/the-real-housewives-of-new-jersey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Real Housewives of New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; streaming on Peacock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many of us prefer walking outdoors in our neighborhood, on our &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/outdoors/best-hiking-trails-with-waterfalls/"&gt;favorite hiking trail&lt;/a&gt; under a canopy of trees, or in our local cities and towns. There are positives to using a treadmill, including using it any time the gym is open, even if the weather outside is less than favorable. You can also control the incline and use the built-in fan on your face when you start working up a sweat. Researchers assessed the effects of &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/fitness/treadmill-workout-tips/"&gt;walking on a treadmill&lt;/a&gt; compared to walking outdoors. Let’s look at the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="dt-heading-the-study" aria-label="The study"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_1316798" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1316798" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-dt-lazy-src="https://www.themanual.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/man-in-hoodie-on-treadmill.jpeg?fit=800%2C533&amp;amp;p=1" decoding="async" class=" size-large wp-image-1316798 h-lightbox is-zoomable dt-lazy-load dt-lazy-pending" alt="Man on treadmill"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1316798" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Lightfield Studios / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/epub/10.1089/eco.2021.0043" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ecopsychology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, researchers compared how walking in a natural outdoor environment and walking in an indoor simulated natural environment affected emotion and measures of perceived exertion. The goal was to understand if exercising outside leads to more significant physical exertion and the resulting emotional responses. They measured heart rate to assess physical exertion in a study involving 74 university students.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The participants were split into two groups. Group one walked outdoors on a 0.6 km flat pavement. Group two watched a video of the same outdoor path while walking &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/fitness/treadmill-workout-tips/"&gt;indoors on a treadmill&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_1361259" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1361259" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-dt-lazy-src="https://www.themanual.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pexels-pexels-latam-man-jogging-brisk-walking-outdoors-in-nature-.jpg?fit=800%2C533&amp;amp;p=1" decoding="async" class=" size-large wp-image-1361259 h-lightbox is-zoomable dt-lazy-load dt-lazy-pending" alt="Man jogging brisk walking outdoors in nature"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1361259" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Latam / Pexels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both groups walked for 15 minutes at their own pace. Researchers used the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale or RPE scale and used heart rate monitors to measure exertion. They assessed the participants’ emotional responses using surveys that involved factors like calmness, tension, energy, and tiredness before and after walking. Participants also recorded weather conditions like temperature, wind, and cloud cover.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="dt-heading-the-results" aria-label="The results"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_1362160" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1362160" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-dt-lazy-src="https://www.themanual.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/pexels-olly-Man-on-treadmill-with-sleeveless-shirt-in-gym.jpg?fit=800%2C533&amp;amp;p=1" decoding="async" class=" size-large wp-image-1362160 h-lightbox is-zoomable dt-lazy-load dt-lazy-pending" alt="Man on treadmill with sleeveless shirt in gym"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1362160" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Olly / Pexels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers concluded that:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Outdoor walking increased the heart rate more than &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/fitness/treadmill-workout-tips/"&gt;walking indoors on the treadmill&lt;/a&gt;. Participants who walked outdoors had a much higher average heart rate, indicating more significant physiological exertion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants’ perceptions of their walks were pretty similar between both the outdoor and indoor walkers, with both rating their exertion as ‘very light’ to ‘light’ using the RPE scale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The group that walked outdoors found a much higher increase in their energy levels, whereas indoor walkers reported no change. Indoor walkers did experience a significant reduction in tension, but the outdoor walkers didn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;There were no notable differences between the groups when it comes to calmness, tiredness, positive affect, and negative affect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers stated that their findings align with previous research highlighting that acute bouts of physical activity in a natural environment enhance positive activated effect. The positive activated effect refers to a subjective mental state and feelings of positive energy, engagement, alertness, and enthusiasm. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="dt-heading-the-takeaway" aria-label="The takeaway"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_1365626" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1365626" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-dt-lazy-src="https://www.themanual.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/atrack_cos_44037_1_1_2-1.jpg?fit=800%2C564&amp;amp;p=1" decoding="async" class=" size-large wp-image-1365626 h-lightbox is-zoomable dt-lazy-load dt-lazy-pending" alt="man with an orange backpack walking outside"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1365626" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;ORTLIEB / ORTLIEB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This study showed that walking or exercising outdoors and breathing in the natural fresh air can elevate your heart rate higher compared to walking indoors on a treadmill. Outdoor walking seems to be more energizing, so maybe it’s worth finding a nearby tranquil trail or strolling through your neighborhood. This study also shows that walking outside could lead to greater enjoyment, and if you enjoy something more, you’re&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28436287/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; more likely&lt;/a&gt; to do it, setting us up for future fitness success.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“We all get exactly the same virus but it’s the amount of protective layer and amount of reserve that you’ve got available,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A young, fit person will only need 10 per cent of their reserve to fight the flu virus, whereas an older adult might need 100 per cent. The body throws absolutely everything at the virus and there’s nothing left for the next thing that comes along.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bronchitis means that the lining of the airways is inflamed and irritated,” Dr Strain explains. “&lt;em&gt;Bronchus&lt;/em&gt; is the airways [the tube that carries air from your windpipe into your lungs] and &lt;em&gt;itis &lt;/em&gt;means inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the body’s response to flu but can also be caused by other respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a young, healthy person develops bronchitis, the protective layer in their respiratory tract will very quickly heal over,” Dr Strain says. “For older adults, it takes them much, much longer for the protective layers to heal over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, they are vulnerable to a bacterial infection, which occurs if the normal bugs living in the airways penetrate through the damaged mucus lining. This can ultimately lead to pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pneumonia is inflammation of the lungs, usually caused by an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body senses that inflammation has occurred (for example, as a result of bronchitis) and bacteria is present, the immune system releases white blood cells, also known as leukocytes, whose job it is to ward off infection and inflammation, Dr Strain explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But these cells can clog up the alveoli – tiny air sacs in the lungs that allow oxygen and carbon dioxide to be exchanged – so that we can’t breathe properly,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In England, emergency admissions for pneumonia range between 130,000 to 270,000 per year and it is fatal in 5-14 per cent of hospitalised cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vast majority of people who are dying from pneumonia are already in their last two years of life,” Dr Strain explains. For patients with lots of health problems, it’s usually the thing that pushes them over the edge, he adds. Flu and pneumonia were responsible for more than 24,000 deaths (or 4.2 per cent of all deaths in England and Wales) in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An influenza infection will cause flu-like symptoms, including a sudden high temperature, an aching body and exhaustion. At this stage, turn to simple paracetamol and drink plenty of fluids to manage symptoms, Dr Strain says. Antibiotics don’t work against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a fever burns lots of extra energy, so bringing a fever down with paracetamol will actually help people to get better quicker,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, bronchitis usually clears up on its own within weeks by drinking lots of fluid, getting plenty of rest and taking paracetamol to ease symptoms. “You don’t need to be in hospital if you can continue to drink fluids and still feel lucid,” Dr Strain says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a patient has pneumonia, they are usually given antibiotics and get better at home within two to four weeks, though older and at-risk patients will likely be admitted to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As soon as a person starts behaving differently – it could be that they become erratic, hyper-emotional or completely withdrawn – that’s the time we need to see them in hospital,” Dr Strain says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if they are still at the viral [flu] stage, we need to make sure they’re not at risk of a bacterial infection. It’s a bacterial infection, on top of their viral infection, that’s going to do damage,” he says. Doctors can find out if a bacterial infection has occurred through a quick blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the infection is viral, then the patient will be given fluids and paracetamol, just as they would at home, but if there’s any evidence of a bacterial infection, there will be heavy-duty antibiotics for 24 to 48 hours, Dr Strain says. “Getting on top of that as quickly as possible is really beneficial for patients,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding catching flu or another respiratory infection in the first place is the key step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While infections can be unavoidable, sensible steps like avoiding people who’ve got a viral illness – including telling family to delay a visit if they’ve got a cough and cold – is simple but effective, Dr Strain says. The &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cold-flu/covid-vaccine-nhs-autumn-jabs/"&gt;flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; means a flu infection is more likely to be mild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to prevent frailty by keeping active, Dr Strain says. “Frailty – the inability to tackle infections as they hit you – is what’s going to put you in hospital,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Going out for your daily five minute walk to pick up the newspaper, or even just getting out a few times a week, is very clearly demonstrated to boost your immune system,” Dr Strain notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who keep active, they will still feel terrible when hit with a respiratory infection, but they’re going to bounce back from it quickly, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more frail a person is, the longer it will take to recover from pneumonia, he notes. “It can take several months to build your strength back up to where you were and it’s important for those picking up their loved one from hospital to know that they’re not going to be as strong as they were.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the end of the day, we cannot make people live forever,” says Dr Strain. “What we want to do is keep them as healthy as possible until they die. And pneumonia is the thing that tends to be the final straw for people who have problems with their health.”&lt;/p&gt;

This comes after a surge in cases of the flu-like human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China raised fears of another Covid-style pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mid-newpos-mgid="mgid_118453245" id="div-mgid-mid-newpos-118453245"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Images of hospitals overrun with masked patients have circulated widely on social media, but health experts say HMPV is not like Covid, and point out it has been around for many years. They say China and other countries are simply experiencing the seasonal increase in HMPV typically seen in winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the newly discovered virus HKU5-CoV-2?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is still no consensus on the origin of the virus, some studies suggest it originated in bats and jumped to humans through an intermediate animal host.

                                &lt;p&gt;It's Heart Health Month, and heart issues among younger people are becoming more and more common. Cardiologist Dr. Anand Balachandran says overuse of caffeine is a main contributor, and younger people are getting screened earlier than they used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says caffeine puts a strain on the cardiovascular system, causing an increased heart rate that can lead to blood pressure issues and heart failure. Balachandran says your body is strong, but too much stress can cause a lot of damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balachandran said, "Any stimulant you take, your body is responding to the stimulant just like if you were to make this computer work extra hard, it's going to crash in a matter of time. Similarly, your body is strong. It can resist so many things it has survived decades of everything, it's meant to survive. But when you put it through that stress over time, it's going to show signs of wear and tear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balachandran says his biggest worry when it comes to young people is the overconsumption of highly caffeinated energy drinks. He encourages everyone to practice a healthy lifestyle by staying active, eating healthy, and limiting caffeine as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The worker reported symptoms of illness before the cat got sick. That cat fell ill, tested positive for H5N1 and had to be euthanized. A second cat in that household also got sick, but it recovered. A third cat in the household didn’t get sick and tested negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LEIFACQK3BD6POU74PZY2X3LQQ"&gt;Meanwhile, an adolescent in the household got sick but tested negative for flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="POO47JWQJRB7TDVF6K7SHIXURE"&gt;The other cat that died lived in a different household. That pet belonged to a dairy worker who transported raw milk and reported frequent splashes of milk on the face, eyes and clothing.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rcpe.ac.uk/heritage/heritage-blog/deadly-nightshade-botanical-biography"&gt;Rumored to have killed&lt;/a&gt; the Roman emperor Augustus, nightshade's berries are notoriously deadly. Tomatoes belong to the same plant family, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanaceae"&gt;Solanaceae&lt;/a&gt;, and produce toxic steroidal glycoalkaloids too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, generally, tomatoes don't kill us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once &lt;a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=kEXuuSFzj2kC&amp;amp;pg=PA12&amp;amp;dq=tomatoes+AND+pewter+plates&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=p0y3UdTQG4aJjALI44GgDQ&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=tomatoes%20AND%20pewter%20plates&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;believed to be poisonous&lt;/a&gt;, tomatoes (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato"&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) actually convert their bitter toxins into something more palatable and less deadly. Sichuan University biologist Feng Bai and colleagues have now identified the genetic mechanisms involved in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-why-a-tomato-is-actually-both-a-fruit-and-vegetable"&gt;tomato fruit's&lt;/a&gt; safe transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152887" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152887" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tomato_evolution_642.jpg" alt="Scientists Have Just Discovered How Tomatoes Don't Kill Us" class="size-full wp-image-152887" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tomato_evolution_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tomato_evolution_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tomato_evolution_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152887" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Average fruit size in the cultivated tomato in comparison with its semi-domesticated and fully wild relatives. (&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/modern-tomatoes-are-very-different-from-their-wild-ancestors-and-we-found-missing-links-in-their-evolution-130041"&gt;Hamid Razifard/CC BY-ND-4.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solanaceae make use of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanine"&gt;steroidal glycoalkaloids&lt;/a&gt; as a natural defense against pests. These molecules are thought to mess with animal cell membranes, damaging them and eventually causing cell death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://molhort.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s43897-024-00118-y"&gt;Potatoes&lt;/a&gt;, another member of this toxic family, have been cultivated to have safe levels of these compounds, though they can pump them out when damaged or exposed to large amounts of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, this glycoalkaloid substance tastes unpleasantly bitter. Ingesting too much leads to a burning sensation in the mouth, followed by symptoms including nausea, cramps, slow pulse and reduced breathing, vomiting, diarrhea, internal bleeding, and stomach lesions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these same plants also need their seeds dispersed, and animals are great at this. So in some of the plants, as their seed-bearing fruits ripen, the bitter toxic chemicals are converted into something more palatable to entice &lt;a href="https://www.kew.org/read-and-watch/plant-seed-dispersal-animal-poo"&gt;pooping seed taxis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bai and team discovered that in tomatoes, the chemicals that make the fruits redder, softer, and sweeter also coordinate the breakdown of the toxic glycoalkaloid into a less toxic compound called esculeoside A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[This helps] ensure that high levels of toxic steroidal glycoalkaloids remain in immature fruits to maintain resistance against herbivory attacks, guaranteeing that the fruits reach the seed maturation stage," the team &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ads9601"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deliciously fruited plants make use of epigenetic regulation to control the cascade of changes required to make their bounty safe for us to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, a protein called DML2 allows the cell's gene-reading machinery to access genes involved in stopping the toxins by removing methyl groups, which act as molecular signals, from a specific part of the genetic chromosome – a process called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demethylation"&gt;demethylation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KYHBbEKap0A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers genetically disabled the creation of DML2 in the tomatoes, the fruit produced still contained high levels of the steroidal glycoalkaloids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing the genes involved in other related plants, Bai and team also found &lt;em&gt;DML2-&lt;/em&gt;driven DNA demethylation increased during the tomato plant's domestication, which changed the plants from small berry producers to large red fruit creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the levels of genes supporting steroidal glycoalkaloids also decreased. Now, even green tomatoes can be safely eaten in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes ultimately made this &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tomato-juice-can-kill-salmonella-the-bacteria-that-terrorizes-our-guts"&gt;gut-protecting crop&lt;/a&gt; healthier for us all to devour, and in return, we spread tomatoes across new continents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ads9601"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

However, both workers had shown symptoms suggestive of infection, the study said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one case, a worker who wasn’t employed on a farm but transported unpasteurized milk between farms reported conjunctivitis. The other person worked on a dairy farm and reported seeing several dead barn cats on the premises. He suffered gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting the day before a pet cat became sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both workers also ended communication with health officials before the investigation was over, with one citing fear of losing employment for implicating dairy farms, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two adolescents living in one of the worker’s homes also became sick. Both tested negative for the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University in Providence, R.I., said the paper raises more questions than it answers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve known that cats can become ill with H5N1,” she said. “This paper raises, but does not answer, the question of whether farmworkers may spread H5N1 to their cats. We need to know more about how this may have occurred, as it could inform our understanding of whether people can spread the virus to other animals, including other humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the workers declined to be tested for the virus, the authors could not conclude that they had passed the virus to their pet cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, a 5-year-old indoor cat belonging to one of the dairy workers was brought to a local veterinary clinic after showing decreased appetite, disinterest in grooming, disorientation and tiredness. After not improving over two more days, the cat was referred to the Michigan State University Veterinary Medical Center., where the cat was euthanized after “rapid disease progression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the cat’s owner was a dairy farm worker, and there were reports of H5N1 in local dairy farms, the cat’s body was sent to the university’s diagnostic laboratory, where tests confirmed the presence of the virus. That discovery triggered the investigation by state public health officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second dairy worker household, a 6-month-old Maine Coon cat that lived exclusively indoors was brought directly to the Michigan State veterinary clinic. The cat also tested positive for the virus and died 24 hours later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second cat in the household had no symptoms and tested negative for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cats’ owner reported not wearing protective equipment and being frequently splashed by milk in the eyes and face, and on clothing. The worker told investigators that the Maine coon cat would often roll in those clothes, something the second cat never did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner reported experiencing eye irritation that began two days before the coon cat got sick. The owner wasn’t tested for influenza, declined antiviral treatment and ended communication with the investigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is depressing and will continue until we have more severe illnesses reported that scare people,” said John Korslund, a retired U.S. Department of Agriculture veterinarian and researcher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said his biggest concern is the time lag among infection, symptoms and testing, which can be on the order of three days to two weeks — a pause that enables the virus to move undetected through farms and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are consistently testing humans much too late — after cow herds have shown clinical signs and workers have ‘recovered,’” he said. “If we want to get serious about finding human H5 infections, we’ll need to use rapid tests in [workers’] homes when the eyes first are red, independent of what is happening in the herd on the farm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The workers, the cats, and the bulk milk samples are the best sentinels for early dairy herd diagnoses,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 11:00:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxNcFVhQ2RTYlc3M3hmZmoyUEM2RmwtemFWVWpnemlHVnpDUk1GRjBPTlBYQVRSTHk2X2JZUWJxTzAxRWNaNU9lMDVCcjAzTWcwanAyMkt3RVQ3TWVqSG1YUng0X0IzXy1TZmlqc3c2X0tMdnhsZEJPVy1wSElSMU42bEVQZmg1dldRNmx5WmpmbGZ4R1dkT29pa290UUo3Wi12dWtjQ2t6YlcxNkhKYm1lSEQ5SXVTRDNkekFzaXEyUE1vUG1vTW1Ca0V6Yw</guid></item><item><title>10 Probiotic Foods To Eat Daily For a Strong Immune System - Vogue</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWEFVX3lxTE5hbUllSE1VQWFETDBxalF4SXNBNWlVNTZycU9GT0pxOGNQLTU1cEw2b0w2RVZUVXZMWlRsYVRNcDFQT3hIajZVQjNKeHF6QXBNSUh4QzVNWl8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most widely-consumed fermented food is probably yogurt—but there are many other fermented foods, including miso, sauerkraut, buttermilk, cultured butted, kefir, and kombucha. If you’re shopping for fermented foods at the grocery, look for products labeled with the words “contains live cultures” or “contains active probiotics” to ensure that you are getting as many beneficial live microorganisms if possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best probiotic foods for a healthy gut microbiome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;1. Yogurt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, yogurt is one of the most popular and readily available probiotic-rich foods. It is made by fermenting milk and is rich in Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, both which help to balance intestinal flora and promote digestion. For maximum benefits, choose natural yogurt—preferably organic—that doesn’t contain added sugars or artificial additives. &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/greek-yogurt-health-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; is usually the richest in probiotics thanks to its high concentration of protein and milk enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;2. Kefir&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kefir is a fermented beverage similar to yogurt. Although non-dairy versions made from coconut exist, most kefir is derived from milk. Either way, kefir contains a variety of bacterial strains and yeasts, making it one of the richest sources of probiotics. The benefits of kefir go beyond &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/this-is-my-post-dinner-trick-to-reduce-bloating" target="_blank"&gt;reduced bloating&lt;/a&gt; and a strong immune system—it can also improve bone health due to its high calcium content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;3. Ripened cheeses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aged cheeses such as parmesan, gouda, and cheddar contain natural probiotics, thanks to the fermentation process. Although they do not contain as many live microorganisms as yogurt or kefir, aged cheeses are still a good source of beneficial bacteria. They also offer another advantage: they are rich in calcium and fat-soluble vitamins, which contribute to bone health. Plus, aged cheese is delicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;4. Apple cider vinegar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only is &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/a-spoonful-of-apple-cider-vinegar" target="_blank"&gt;apple cider vinegar&lt;/a&gt; a popular &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/glucose-goddess-interview" target="_blank"&gt;blood-sugar balancing&lt;/a&gt; condiment, but it’s also rich in probiotics. Apple cider vinegar is fermented by acid acetic bacteria (AAB), which have beneficial properties for the gut. Consuming unpasteurized apple cider vinegar (preferably organic) helps promote the growth of good bacteria and improve digestion. It can also help balance pH levels in the body, contributing to a healthier microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;5. Kimchi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/kimchi-gut-health" target="_blank"&gt;Kimchi&lt;/a&gt; is a traditional Korean dish made from fermented cabbage or other vegetables and seasoned with spices such as chili, garlic, and ginger. During the fermentation process, Lactobacillus bacteria develop, enriching kimchi with probiotics. It is a food not only rich in probiotics, but also in vitamins and minerals, making it useful for boosting immunity and improving digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;6. Kombucha&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/what-are-the-health-benefits-of-kombucha" target="_blank"&gt;Kombucha&lt;/a&gt; is a fermented tea-based beverage that contains beneficial bacteria and yeasts. Known for its detoxifying and anti-inflammatory properties, kombucha is also an excellent source of probiotics. Fermenting the tea with a “SCOBY”—symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast— enriches the beverage with a variety of bacterial strains beneficial to gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;7. Miso&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/miso-health-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;Miso&lt;/a&gt;, a fermented paste made from soybeans, is a staple in Japanese cuisine. Through fermentation with the fungus Aspergillus oryzae, miso is rich in probiotics and can support digestion, improve gut flora, and strengthen the immune system. It is especially useful in a vegetarian and vegan diet as a source of protein, &lt;a href="https://vogue.com/article/deficient-in-vitamin-b12" target="_blank"&gt;B12&lt;/a&gt;, minerals, and—yes—probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;8. Tempeh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tempeh is another type of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/fermented-foods" target="_blank"&gt;fermented soybean food&lt;/a&gt;, but unlike miso, it comes in a solid form similar to tofu. Fermentation of tempeh promotes the growth of probiotic bacteria, which improve digestion and contribute to a healthy microbiota. Tempeh makes a great source of plant protein and is &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/iron-vitamin-absorption" target="_blank"&gt;rich in iron&lt;/a&gt; and calcium, making it especially ideal for those on a plant-based diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;9. Sauerkraut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sauerkraut is fermented cabbage that, like kimchi, contains Lactobacillus bacteria. This food is an excellent source of natural probiotics, as well as vitamin C and vitamin K. Consuming sauerkraut regularly can improve digestion and gut health, and may also promote &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/immune-system-tips" target="_blank"&gt;immune system wellness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;10. Natto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sticky food is often an acquired taste, but well-worth the adjustment phase thanks to its healthy properties. Made from soybeans fermented with the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, natto is a traditional Japanese food known for its high vitamin K2 content and high probiotic content. Natto aids digestion and can improve bone and cardiovascular health thanks to its natural protein and beneficial enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWEFVX3lxTE5hbUllSE1VQWFETDBxalF4SXNBNWlVNTZycU9GT0pxOGNQLTU1cEw2b0w2RVZUVXZMWlRsYVRNcDFQT3hIajZVQjNKeHF6QXBNSUh4QzVNWl8</guid></item><item><title>7 Reasons Why You MUST Regularise Your Bowel Movements - Rediff.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="contents cover" animate-in="fly-in-bottom" animate-in-duration="1s"&gt;

Some schools are temporarily closing due to illnesses, and some hospitals are overwhelmed with patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 activity is also high or very high in 30 states, according to wastewater &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-currentlevels.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/php/surveillance/rsv-net.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:RSV rates are declining;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;RSV rates are declining&lt;/a&gt; but are still higher than they were in early December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you have a respiratory illness, excess mucus is an under-appreciated line of defense from your immune system. But can you really tell what kind of illness you have or where you are in your infection based on your mucus? Here’s a breakdown of what goes on inside our body when we’re sick and why mucus changes colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is mucus? Why does your body produce it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mucus is the body’s natural moisturizer and provides a first line of defense against irritants from the outside environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It lubricates the lining of the nose when it gets too dry but also traps outside invaders, like germs and dust, because of how sticky it becomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our bodies produce mucus as both a normal way to help maintain good health and to help one fight off infection,” Glatt states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal mucus often looks clear or white for most people, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But mucus changes color, depending on the individual’s environment, in response to various germs and more, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does yellow mucus mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellow mucus means your body's immune system has been activated, which can change the color or consistency of your mucus, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/mucus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, during an infection, the mucus will be clear, but it usually changes to yellow within a few days. Many people believe that yellow or green mucus indicates a bacterial infection, but experts caution that color doesn’t correlate to a particular type of infection, as both viruses and bacteria can cause yellow mucus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellow mucus could also be caused by non-infectious triggers, like allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does yellow mucus mean a cold is healing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a typical viral respiratory infection, such as the common cold, mucus in the nose starts out as clear but gradually turns yellow or green as the infection progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So essentially, yellow mucus just means your immune system has been activated. For &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/cold-flu/signs-your-cold-is-getting-better-rcna127645" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:signs your cold is getting better;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;signs your cold is getting better&lt;/a&gt;, look for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mucus turning clear again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your symptoms becoming less severe, like having fever body aches and less nasal congestion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week has passed and you're feeling overall better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your energy coming back&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What stage of infection is yellow mucus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It often is an early sign of an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/scott-c-roberts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Scott Roberts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Scott Roberts&lt;/a&gt;, associate medical director of infection prevention at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, however, cautions to not judge mucus by its color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommends paying more attention to the consistency of the mucus — whether there is thick pus or not — to know if you have a sinus infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, thin mucus may be a sign of an early infection, but as the mucus thickens, this suggests more severe congestion in the nose, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does green mucus mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green mucus is also a sign that your body either has encountered an irritant or is experiencing an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mucus may go from a clearer appearance to a much more infected (pus-like) and green appearance in response to viral or bacterial infection,” Glatt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mucus may also change from yellow to green as it becomes more concentrated, often when we are sleeping or not well hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common myth is that green mucus is a tell-tale sign of a bacterial infection, but both viruses and bacteria can cause this color change. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/health-and-wellness/2020/march/what-your-nasal-discharge-says-about-your-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:past research has found;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;past research has found&lt;/a&gt; that nasal discharge turns different colors due to the presence of white blood cells, which battle the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, one clue you might need antibiotics is persistent thick, green discharge lasting for more than 10 days, &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-nasal-mucus-color-what-does-it-mean/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do other mucus colors mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mucus often changes colors when dead cells, germs and other substances, like blood or tobacco smoke, gets mixed with it, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/mucus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. These colors include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pink: &lt;/strong&gt;Mucus can turn pink after an injury to the nose when it gets streaked with blood. It can also be a sign your nasal passages are so dry that tiny blood vessels that line them have burst and leaked blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brown&lt;/strong&gt;: This may be a sign of a more severe infection like bronchitis or pneumonia. It is also common during colder seasons (when the air in our homes have less humidity), which leads to dry nasal passages that cause small amounts of blood from tiny burst blood vessels in the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black&lt;/strong&gt;: This could be old, dried blood. The mucus can also turn black when environmental irritants, like dust particles, smoke or other air pollutants, get stuck in the nasal passages. Serious fungal infections can darken mucus as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get rid of mucus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Druckman says “fluids and rest are key.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Making sure you’re drinking enough water will help flush out any mucus and help thin it out, and getting adequate rest will help your body heal faster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another way to reduce the effects of mucus is to place a humidifier in your room, which can help loosen your mucus a bit and make it easier to manage,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For optimal drainage, it’s recommended to sleep with your head slightly elevated and to ease symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other home remedies include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasal rinses, which help clear the mucus from your nose and sinuses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decongestants to temporarily decrease inflammation in the nose and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expectorants to thin out the mucus so it’s easier to clear it out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antihistamines to calm down the body’s immune system, which causes excess mucus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t feel something is exactly right about the color or consistency of your mucus, check in with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The duration of symptoms also matters. You should also seek medical attention if you have persistent colored mucus and symptoms for more than a week, Druckman adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other warning signs are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark-colored mucus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much blood mixed in with mucus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thick nasal discharge with facial pain lasting longer than 10 days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent fevers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Runny nose with a persistent cough or chest tightness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severe symptoms not improving with home remedies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To stay protected, I recommend getting the flu vaccine, washing hands frequently, and staying home when feeling unwell,” Druckman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Taking these steps can help reduce the spread and protect yourself and those around you during flu season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/cold-flu/yellow-mucus-meaning-rcna192836" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TODAY.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:21:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE41RVhUZEpCMXZQOXRXaGtFXzV6YzFnNnFTeXJBSEZKSTBNZW5Ha2tSUlJuN2ZPUXIzZnhVY3BqZmVWTHlDcmNfYnZBbXhwQUtHLTRPMnl1em1Hd1FRU3lpdTFWRkp5czZVSUJYZnBRUHVaaXdw</guid></item><item><title>A New Study Reveals Eating These Seeds Could Do Wonders for Your Health - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFB3ejY2UEFQYXkxaGZaWGNodDg4UTF0ZWFJU0xWNW01NG5ZUlBPVHlRNkM5R2w1c19feDJ4SkZPankzUm53VGV3b1hQU21nRUUzbG1CMUdBOU9TR0VkWlFDNl9mMVVuWUVvT3VlY2pwbnlmVU9BekE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Chia Seeds Really Are That Healthy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;fcafotodigital - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too many foods these days sport "health halos," meaning that they are touted all over social media as super healthy, even if they don’t deliver (we're looking at you, coconut oil and &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a44852/apple-cider-vinegar-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:apple cider vinegar!;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;apple cider vinegar!&lt;/a&gt;).

In addition to omega-3s, protein, fiber, Iu notes that chia seeds are rich in minerals like calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these nutrients have positive effects on your body, recent research shows. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39299649/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A new study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;A new study&lt;/a&gt; from Iraq and Iran found that chia seed consumption can lower blood pressure and cholesterol, could potentially help lower body weight and may help prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Chinese researchers are looking into why that is, and &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/fo/d3fo02197a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recently reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that chia seeds contain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/bioactive-molecule" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bioactive macromolecular substances;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;bioactive macromolecular substances&lt;/a&gt; like oil, protein and gum.

Chia seeds can even help relieve constipation by adding bulk to your stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to bring some chia love into your diet? Here’s how to use chia seeds to your best nutritional advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you eat chia seeds every day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can indeed eat them every day. “A serving size of chia seeds is 1 tablespoon,” says &lt;a href="https://anitamirchandani.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anita Mirchandani MS RD CDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Anita Mirchandani MS RD CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian and personal trainer in New York City, who recommends one serving a day. “A little goes a long way!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you overdo chia seeds, they could make you pretty uncomfortable&lt;/strong&gt; – think: major gas and bloating. “Be cautious with chia seeds if you have digestive issues like irritable bowel disease, or if you're sensitive to high fiber,” says Iu. “The right amount to consume will vary by individual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Mayo Clinic &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/chia-seeds-pack-nutritional-punch" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:specifically reports;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;specifically reports&lt;/a&gt; that a serving of chia seeds (which they count as 2.5 tbs) contains 10 grams of fiber. When sprinkling chia seeds on yogurt or into a chicken salad, it’s not hard to use that much. But even if you don’t have digestive sensitivity, eating more than that could give you diarrhea. Your smartest move, says Iu, is to take things slowly, see how you feel after trying a single tablespoon of chia seeds, and if you feel good, gradually increase the amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some great ways to use chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although chia seeds can be eaten raw, eating them with soft or liquid consistency foods can help your body get used to them more easily (and it is possible to choke if you scarf too many dry chia seeds at once.) Chia seeds contain &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health-products/g43632266/best-fiber-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:soluble fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; and so absorb liquid and expand. “Chia seeds can be added to oatmeal or &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/healthy/g4060/healthy-smoothie-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:smoothies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt;,” says Mirchandani. “I’ve heard people add it to rice dishes because of the consistency, too. My go-to is to soak chia seeds overnight in milk or water, making them into a pudding to have the next morning.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Mykola Sosiukin - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it’s time to experiment more. “You can sprinkle chia seeds onto yogurt, or enjoy them as a crunchy addition to salad,” says Moore. “You can also stir chia seeds into cooked berries to make a simple berry jam. They’re versatile in the kitchen – chia seeds are non-perishable, putting nutrition conveniently at your fingertips.” Iu keeps her chia seeds in a cute glass jar in her kitchen: “I keep it visible near my breakfast items, which makes it easy for me to sprinkle chia seeds over toast or in &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a35688305/congee-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:congee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;congee&lt;/a&gt; or juices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What not to do: &lt;strong&gt;Don’t add loads of butter or sugar to your chia dish – that pretty much negates the overall health-factor. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who should not eat chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people are allergic to chia seeds. A study from Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine &lt;a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(22)02196-0/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:found that this allergy is rare;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;found that this allergy is rare&lt;/a&gt;, and most often affects Hispanic women and those who have a sensitivity to sesame. Chia seed allergy can cause &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fanaphylaxis%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20351468&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiet-nutrition%2Fa63785578%2Fare-chia-seeds-really-healthy%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anaphylaxis,;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;anaphylaxis, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;so if you have any reason to think you might be allergic to them, have your health care provider do a prick test of your skin before you try them. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other folks who should give them a miss are those who have trouble swallowing, says Moore, and eating too many at once for anyone could be a choking hazard. Be especially careful about giving chia seeds to your kids for this reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFB3ejY2UEFQYXkxaGZaWGNodDg4UTF0ZWFJU0xWNW01NG5ZUlBPVHlRNkM5R2w1c19feDJ4SkZPankzUm53VGV3b1hQU21nRUUzbG1CMUdBOU9TR0VkWlFDNl9mMVVuWUVvT3VlY2pwbnlmVU9BekE</guid></item><item><title>Ultraprocessed Foods: How Bad Could They Be? - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOU3F0QjE3cTl1SVdyQVVNSnFoc3BTUkxrSkdfWThyVTJwREk3OXI5M3I4Y2dkM2RRcVRGVUJQUGtRZzJ0R1AxWElodUtVa2RHb0I3VWtTTHRzRUQtTHR1czRNbXhSRGZjZXcySURPMVhidTdMblFPaEtXZkFlalhVdzVhVGQxLUlVZmZGdjBRMUJpYUpMMHFJVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="episode-transcript-container" id="transcript-container"&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Today, I'm sitting down with my colleague and my friend, CNN medical correspondent Meg Tirrell. You know, Meg is a really talented journalist. She writes. She's on TV all the time. She's guest hosted a few episodes of this podcast. But as you just heard, Meg's other full time job, more important job is mom to two young boys. How much do you think about their their diet?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's kind of a balance for me between letting my anxiety take over about what they're not eating and all the nutrients I'm worried they're not getting, and just making sure they get enough calories.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:00:52
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Like all great reporters, Meg lets her personal curiosity lead the way. And lately, she's been doing some deep dives on something we see all around us, but definitely don't know enough about ultra processed foods.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Like, how are you supposed to figure out, like, what's healthy to eat? Are you supposed to avoid 70% of foods in our food system?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

                00:01:16
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'And I do want to point out that ultra processed foods contain ingredients that you would not typically find in your kitchen. Some are even made using industrial cooking methods not accessible to the average home chef. Now, Meg has talked about this topic before on the podcast, but I wanted to invite her back to discuss the latest science of ultra processed foods because, in part, the quality of our food supply has been a hot topic during the RFK Jr's confirmation hearings, and also because Meg recently took this really fascinating reporting trip to the NIH, the National Institutes of Health researchers there are trying to answer two fundamental questions. Number one, what is it that actually makes ultra processed foods so bad for us? And number two, could those ultra processed foods one day be considered healthy? I know, I know. Ultra-processed foods being healthy? Well, the answers could shape U.S. food policy. They could guide how we feed ourselves and our families for a long time to come. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, and this is Chasing Life.

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Oh, and one more thing. Meg and I took a close look at what goes into some of my favorite foods.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I have heard from my inside sources.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Uh-oh, you're inside sources may not like me, so I'm scared. It was, let's just say, an enlightening experience. I remember your last time you were on the podcast talking about this. If you can't buy these ingredients, or if you wouldn't do this at home yourself, that's probably a good indication that what you're eating is ultra processed. Fair?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;

                00:03:09
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And when you read these ingredient list, there's a lot of things on there that you would never buy in a store. You would never add these things to yourself. So you go to the grocery store you're trying to buy well, for your for yourself, your family, your husband. How much of what you're buying is likely to be ultra processed?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Unless you're trying to avoid it the majority of the stuff that you're going to find is probably ultra processed. I mean, unless you're going to the bakery section, we don't know what the freshly baked breads, that might not be ultra processed, but it might be. You don't know.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I mean, if you asked, would you know? And how would you find out?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, probably. You could probably ask for the ingredients list and see if there's any weird thing in there.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I don't know, but no one does that. Right. Because it seems like I need to go buy my groceries and like, I might do it after talking to you, but it's where, I guess if you buy, if you eat meat. Going to the to the fresh meat section, you could probably be pretty confident that it's not ultra processed.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Probably. Deli meat though, you know, might have some preservatives or some other things in it that could make it ultra processed.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I'll ask some version of this question a couple times, but as as difficult and maybe even dire as that all sounds, is it necessarily bad for you?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's the question that scientists are trying to answer now. And the studies that we've had up until now, there have been a lot of them. Dozens and dozens have showed a lot of negative health effects linked to ultra processed foods. They're looking back at people's diets, and they find that people who report eating more ultra processed foods have higher levels of obesity, diabetes, even anxiety, and even things like all cause mortality, which you know, is a confusing thing. It's like we're all going to die, but are you going to die sooner if you eat more ultra processed foods? It seems like yeah, maybe. But the problem with these studies is they're backwards looking. So scientists have just started to try to run these, randomized controlled trials of how people eat. And that requires trapping people so they can't cheat. So we went down to the NIH, where they've been running these studies. Some of the only studies like this in the world, the first one they ran came out in 2019, and that was just looking at ultra processed foods versus minimally processed foods. People had to live at the NIH for a month. You know, half the time they're on the minimally processed diet and half the time they're on the ultra processed diet. They were giving them basically identically matched diets based on the nutrients in them. And you know, how the foods looked and things like that. But at the end of this time, they found, that people on average, ate about 500 calories more per day on the ultra processed diet, and over two weeks they gain about 2 pounds. So they were offered the same number of calories on each of the diets, and they ended up eating more calories on the ultra processed diet, perhaps without realizing it, because there's something about ultra processed foods that just made folks eat more of them and that made them gain weight.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;

                00:06:12
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, it's funny going back to these just basic definitions. I think a lot of people, and even as I was thinking about this podcast with you, I was talking to my wife about this. I said, just like, what is your your immediate instinct when you think of ultra processed foods? And she immediately said the additives, like, might they be toxic in some way? Might they be increasing my risk of cancer or something like that? Right? I'm not sure I even got asked this question, Meg, but but how much of this is about the additives are bad versus what they're doing in terms of making me crave it that's bad?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              We don't know yet. But now Doctor Kevin Hall at the NIH is running that study.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              What we're trying to understand is what are the mechanisms? What is it about this category of foods that is driving people to overconsume calories, potentially leading to obesity and these downstream consequences?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So he took the results of the first studies, looked at the clues they got from how people chose to eat in that trial. And he has two hypotheses about what might be driving overeating with ultra processed foods. One is their energy density. So how many calories you're getting in each gram of food you're eating. And it so happens that ultra processed foods are much more energy dense than minimally processed foods. And he says, really that's because they take a lot of the water out of them so that they don't like rot. They're more shelf stable. And then the other thing he's hypothesizing is they're hyper palatability, or we've heard the term the bliss point. So it's this combination of salt, sugar, fat and carbs that's just the right levels that make us like, not want to stop eating foods. And so what he's done is with their nutrition team, devised four different diets. One is minimally processed, one is ultra processed, very similar to the first trial. High hyper palatability, high energy dense. And then two other diets that kind of mix. They're ultra processed, but they vary how hyper palatable they are and how energy dense they are. And what he's trying to see is, can you eat a diet that's made up mostly of ultra processed foods, but that doesn't drive overeating and perhaps all of the other health effects of that, if it's less energy dense or if it's less hyper palatable.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And if we can figure that out, then we can provide our, you know, our our colleagues at the FDA, for example, regulators with information about, you know, how they might want to label foods for example.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              When he was doing this research, I'm sure these these participants who are in the trial, they they knew why they were they're being studied. Did you get a chance to talk to any of them? I'm curious what their sort of experience was going through a study like this, because you have to be in the you're essentially an inpatient, right?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Yeah. So we got to meet one of the participants in this trial. There's only 36 of them. So it was like really cool to get to meet one of these 36 people who's going to potentially influence the way we think about our food and food policy. Same. Sam Reseda, he's 20. He is a pre-med student. So he's in college, which I thought was super cool. So how long have you been here?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's been fine. I mean, I have my PlayStation, my electronics. Honestly feels like a dorm room for me.

              And, yeah, he's, he's allowed to go outside. But somebody has to follow him, you know?
            &lt;/p&gt;

              Really make sure you can't go sneak a Snickers bar.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Go to a vending machine. There was a vending machine strangely close to the metabolic ward. I was like, come on, guys, it's like, why are you doing this for these people? And they track almost everything you can track about a person. He was wearing a continuous glucose monitor. He's wearing, like, three trackers of his movement. They were doing stool samples so they could look at what's going on with this microbiome. They were taking regular blood from him and separating that into all these components to see the effects of food on all kinds of things, including his immune system. And then one of the other things that makes the NIH one of the only places in the world that can do this kind of study is they have one of these things called a metabolic chamber. Participants like Sam come in here for 24 hours at a time, once a week. This room measures literally the air they breathe in and breathe out. They're trying to measure their metabolism, and the only way they can get them food is they've got this little window that, you know, they open on one side, but the food and clothes he opens on the other side.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Kind of sounds like prison.
            &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And he's in there for 24 hours. I asked him how he feels when it comes out. He's like, it's like coming out of one of those, like, cryogenic freezers or like Austin Powers or something.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              When you say that this might impact food policy and this is a what if sort of crystal ball question, but what might that look like? You have a study like this that Kevin Hall is doing at the NIH. What could that translate to?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, his hope is that he can, you know, generate this evidence. That'll be good, strong evidence telling us these answers about food. And if he finds, you know, that foods that are super hyper palatable and high in energy density do lead to this overeating, you can provide that information to a regulator like the FDA as they're considering food policy. Does that change the way you label food? Do you put like, a green light on something that's low energy density and low hyper palatable and or whatever other metrics that are found to be important, or is it used in a different way by regulators? You know, we've we've heard about initiatives to try to lower salt in foods, for example. Could you mandate that food companies lower the the bliss point of some of their foods. Can can you do that kind of thing. I mean we, we don't know. But Kevin Hall wants to provide the information so that regulators can figure out what to do with it, but also so that we as consumers have more information and feel better equipped when we walk into the grocery store. If you could still get these very convenient foods and lower cost foods, but they wouldn't cause those problems. That could help us a lot without just saying, okay. When you go to the grocery store, you can only go to the vegetable section. You can only go to the, you know, the butcher or whatever it is coming up.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Meg and I are going to discuss some of those challenges of food regulation, and also, importantly, what lessons you should take to the grocery store the next time you go. I remember I interviewed Michelle Obama years ago when she was very focused on food, and it was a wide ranging discussion. But one of the things that sort of jumped out at me was this idea that, you know, if you're trying to feed a family of five and you go to McDonald's, you know, you can buy a lot of calories for cheap. And I don't know how much of that just the cost of calories has driven sort of where we are now. But, you know, 20, 25 bucks and you can feed your family that night versus going and buying all these, less processed, minimally processed, highly watered, dense foods that are, I think, agreeably good for you but just aren't going to leave your kids satisfied. There's still going to be maybe hungry because there wasn't enough calories in that. How much do you think this is just about cost?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think a lot of it is about cost. In the first study, they also looked at the costs to prepare the diets, and these were being prepared by chefs. So we're not even talking about the time it took to prepare these diets. But the cost, it was significantly more expensive to eat a minimally processed diet than an ultra processed diet. I think it was like almost 50%.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:13:28
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Really that much more.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. But, you know, it's it's convenient. It's less expensive to eat ultra processed foods. I mean, having to prepare an entire meal for minimally processed foods can take hours. I mean, I'm not a very good cook. I try to do it like on weekends, but it's really hard. And one of the things that really made me feel better was I asked Kevin Hall how he feeds his own family. He's got little kids. Yeah, he still gives them chicken nuggets, you know? And for me, I'm like, oh, I'm on the Applegate farm ones. Those are fine, right? Like, you know, I'm sure there's like different degrees of, like, ultra processed chicken nuggets. I'm just happy they're eating chicken. I hope it's chicken.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. Our definition of what is acceptable and even healthy changes when you have kids. I think for sure. And I will admit that I found myself eating my kids food often.  You know, cleaning up their plate when they hadn't eaten there. There is. That's a mix of why I gained weight. Maybe I'm starting to lose weight a little bit now because my kids have just gotten older.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Not eating their scraps anymore?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:14:25
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I'm not eating the scraps anymore. You know, one thing that comes up a lot and you may or may not know the answer to this, but, you know, people will often say to me, like, I'll go to Italy or I go to Europe and I'll, I'll eat basically the same foods, like I have pasta dinners. I might even have some dessert and things like that. And I find myself feeling better, not gaining as much weight. Maybe even losing weight despite having the same diet. I guess the question is, how unique is the United States and all this?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'It's not unique. But it is - We do have a lot of our calories from ultra processed foods. It is sort of happening all over the world. But you also do hear about how in Europe they have a different approach to regulating additives in food and regulating all sorts of things, you know. I think it's called the precautionary principle, where they actually think, okay, we should figure out what this does, maybe before we allow it to be in our products. Whereas in the United States, we often sort of allow things to come in and then we we see what effect they have. And, I think a lot of folks think that that is potentially a problem.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:15:28
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. You know, it's interesting, I think, for for physicians and people in the health care field, precautionary principles, is almost all the part of our DNA. Like, why wouldn't we just do that. And then you find for certain products, foods, but also things like makeup and things like that. They have these these different supply and production chains in Europe for some of these products versus the United States. So they were even in Canada where they won't they won't include certain ingredients in their foods. And so and I think the, the instinct, I think in the United States is often to say, well, that's why why are we doing this here? And that's terrible there, but it's more nuanced than that. I mean, you know, part of the reason, like even the Fruit Loops, that's come up a lot recently because of what RFK has been saying about that, I think people intuitively is like, yeah, why why are Fruit Loops have more chemicals than in Canada? And what the what the cereal manufacturers will say is, "look, we know, first of all, you're not telling us something we don't know." But also we've tried this and people didn't buy the products.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:16:27
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And and I guess that again, I don't know there's an answer to this, but but fundamentally, even if we learn all these things from Kevin Hall's study and all this. People like what they like. And they like the choice. And they're going to eat what they want to eat anyway, right? Even if they're informed by new labeling or whatever. How optimistic do you think he is? Or maybe even you are, that this will actually lead to to any kind of measurable change?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think the cereal thing is super interesting, because if you have a situation where you're pressuring a company into removing something and that's all you're doing, you're just pressuring them, you're not requiring them to remove something, okay? They try it. Sales go down 10%. So they brought it back, you know, and sales bounced back okay. If you require them to do it they can't bring it back afterwards. So that's the question. It's like how are you going to deal with these things? Just pressuring companies. I mean I've covered the drug industry for a long time. They've dealt with a lot of pressure over their pricing practices. It works for a little, little while. They'll always find ways to raise prices again if they're allowed to. Yeah. I mean, so that's the question is regulation versus pressure. I asked Doctor Hall how optimistic he was that research like this would change anything about the way companies approach the food they make, because they want to sell more food. Of course they want to make it more delicious. They want you to eat more of it. And he was saying, well, you know, a soda company doesn't care whether it's selling you regular soda or diet soda. They don't care how many calories they're selling you because they can price side the same way. And so he sort of use that as analogy of maybe we can change these things. And, and also through behaviors, if you give people information maybe they can use that to, you know, make buying choices that influence what companies do.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:18:11
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I mean, you know, one area that policy often goes, as you well know better than anybody is pricing. And the idea that some products would cost more than others, could, could be something that happens. And personally and I, I'm not an expert, but I think that's a dangerous slope because when you start to think about things like syntaxes, you know, I'm going to charge a tax for something that we now think is sinful in some way. I don't know, I feel like you're punishing people to buy calories.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:18:38
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Nicotine. I put in a different, different category because it really has no redeeming qualities. But food is food. And, you know, you'd rather people eat good, healthy, not super energy dense, calorie dense food. But again, you could feed your family for a five for 25 bucks, that's a pretty good deal. Are you going to put a tax on that and in a sense punish people for that?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Right. That would disproportionately hurt the people who already find food difficult to afford. So there is a huge issue with doing that. And I think that's part of a lot of pushback around all this focus on ultra processed foods. But that probably doesn't mean we shouldn't understand what processed foods do. It's just what do you do with that information? I think there is evidence to suggest with cigarettes, which of course are very different from food. You don't need them to live.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:19:23
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Exactly.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But they have found that taxing those is one of the most effective ways to discourage people from using cigarettes. With food, it's a different question, and I think some places are trying this. And, you know, of course, in New York City, Michael Bloomberg tried to put a tax on soda and it failed.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:19:38
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I you know, I so I interviewed Michael Bloomberg as well about this. And it was it's actually one of the funniest interviews. First of all, he starts off even before we started rolling, he said, I just want to tell you, Sanjay, I love Cheetos. I know I never get that. And I'm like, oh, that's very interesting, Mr. Mayor. Like, you love Cheetos. Things like, why leave the interview with me?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It was a skeleton in his closet. That he needed to put out there.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:20:01
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I just want to get this out of the way. I'm a Cheeto lover. But he had this thing. Obviously, part of it was pricing. But the other part was that if you went to a movie theater, you could no longer buy a 16 ounce sofda, you could buy an eight ounce. And if you wanted, you could buy two, eight ounce sodas. So then you could have your 16oz, but you couldn't buy a 16 ounce in one glass. And I said tell me about that. And he was making this point that I'm adding these micro blocks. This is part policy. But part of this is just psychology. I'm just saying I'm going to make it. Even if it's not more expensive. It's just slightly more difficult for people. And there might be enough people out there who say, hey, eight ounce is enough. I'll just, you know, take that as a micro block.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. And then something with soda. I mean, that's not necessarily in the same category as a meal. So worrying about the, the tax on on folks who are for...
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:20:49
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. So are, you know, in terms of takeaways for people like I, you know, I've often been told read the ingredients. If you can't pronounce some of the ingredients, probably not a good thing to buy. Is that kind of how you just simply approach things when you go grocery shopping?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes. But after learning more about this and talking more with Kevin Hall, I. I suspect it's more nuanced than that. And I also, I'm giving myself a little bit of a break as a parent of young kids who love goldfish crackers.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:21:24
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              They have a lot of ingredients you can't pronounce in the goldfish cracker.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Cracker, including, I think smiles are, an ingredient in goldfish crackers listed in the ingredients list. I definitely I mean, I guess I can make those in my own kitchen, so there we go.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:21:36
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Do they really have that listed in the ingredients?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:21:39
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Good for them.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So I haven't totally changed the way, but I do, I do think about it more for sure.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:21:45
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But this whole thing about not being able to pronounce and we're going to look at some of these products here in a second. But if you can't buy it yourself, the ingredient in the food that you're about to eat. From what I've seen, from what you've reported in the past, that that's a red flag.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. If you're trying to avoid ultra processed foods, it's a red flag.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:22:02
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And people should avoid ultra processed foods. I guess we're coming right back to the beginning of this discussion again. So should I, based on everything you know, it sounds like a good idea to avoid ultra processed foods. They might be too hyper palatable. They might make me eat too much, even unknowingly. And they have all these ingredients that some of. We don't know what they do, but just in terms of precautionary principle might be a good thing to avoid.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, if you can. I think it's a good I mean, I'm not a doctor. You are. You can say that, but.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:22:31
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, again, some of this, to be to be fair to, is we don't have a lot of data to show whether or not some of these ingredients are necessarily bad for people. But if you're if you're trying to apply this precautionary principle and anyone who's listening should maybe think about this a little bit and maybe even look it up and think about how you want to live your life in terms of precautionary principle, there's a lot of things that we do in our lives to avoid something. It's not that it's necessarily going to be a harm to us, but hey, I'd rather not take the chance. But when it comes to some of these ingredients, I don't know. I'm just listening to you. And I don't know that it makes a difference. And I'm a doctor because again, we don't have data on a lot of these things. But I think precautionary principle is pretty sound when it comes to some ingredients that I can't pronounce.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. The way I think about it is like, if I'm in the grocery store and I've got two loaves of bread in front of me and I can look at the ingredients, I'm going to choose the one with the ingredients I recognize all else being equal. If that cost twice as much. Maybe I'll think about it a little more.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              This I mean, this this fundamentally is probably what's going to drive the policy discussion, because I think you're absolutely right. If it cost twice as much. People may choose with their with their wallet more so than their precautionary principle. You know, and that'll be a really interesting discussion to have going forward. Maybe we can talk about that in a future podcast.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. We'll see what happens.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Just what's the timetable on any of this? So the studies are ongoing. How long will they take to complete and have real results? And then what? What happens next?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Yeah. So Kevin Hall's current study, he expects to be done by the middle of 2025. And to have results, he hopes, at least in a pre-print -- so not peer reviewed, published in a journal necessarily -- but to have the results out there in the world by the end of 2025 or early 2026. So these things take a long time. This is slow. And there's not a lot of it going on, and there's a lot of demand for change even before we get these data sets. And already, you know, the USDA Dietary Guidelines Committee is meeting to talk about what's going to go in 2025 to 2030s dietary guidelines. And these won't necessarily change huge amounts of things, but they are important. And they're not they're not considering ultra processed foods. Really. Because they think there's not enough evidence to to help them make decisions about it for this upcoming set. So we're talking about 2030 for that. But whether there could be actions that take place sooner than that. And how much science they're based on and, you know, we're going to have to see and I think industry will push back based on what they say is a lack of evidence.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

                00:25:06
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. And I mean, I think this idea of what, what level of evidence is necessary in order to implement policy change is a question that comes up, not just in health care, but I think in many aspects of our society a lot. And and how cautious we want to be. It'll be interesting to see how it all plays out. I'm fascinated by it. But, you know, I'm a doctor. I think that, 70% roughly of chronic disease in this country is preventable. This is according to studies that I've read and reporting I've done over 20 years. And I think a lot of that is in some way, shape or form based on how we nourish ourselves. Food is the only signal that we consciously give from our outside world to our inside world on a daily basis. We're informing our inside world with with our food. You know, I just think we should be really thoughtful about it based on the best evidence. But as you said at the beginning of this podcast, that evidence is really hard to collect. These aren't the 10,000, you know, huge clinically controlled trials that people would like. And I think what regulators probably need to understand is we may never have that kind of data. So how do you act in the meantime? That's going to be a really good question. So you have a bag of...
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes, I brought you treats! Okay. So I asked Ben Tinker, the head of health, and Sanjay, longtime producer. What Sanjay's favorite treat is. Do you know what it is?

              All right. Do you have reading glasses? I can't even I can't even read this anymore.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Okay, so, here are the ingredients. Okay. Cream, skim milk, liquid sugar, which is sugar and water. Water. Wheat flour. It's probably the cookie dough we're talking about here.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              Yeah.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Sugar. Brown sugar, egg yolks. Butter, which is cream and salt. Expeller pressed soybean oil. Eggs. Coconut oil. Chocolate liqueur. Cocoa, processed with alkali. Cocoa, molasses, guar gum, salt, vanilla extract, natural flavor, cocoa butter, invert sugar, carrageenan, milk fat, tapioca flour, soy lecithin, annatto extract for color, turmeric extract for color, and milk.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, I got to tell you, in some ways I. That's a lot. But I thought I was going to be worse. I thought there's gonna be a lot of things in there that we're going to be these multi, multi syllabic words that I couldn't possibly pronounce. What do you think when you read that list?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's a lot of ingredients. I mean probably to explain the chocolate chip cookie dough. Maybe I should have gotten just vanilla so we could compare. But something like carrageenan.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. What is?

              I don't know. I think it's some kind of maybe gum. I'm not really sure what that is. Or. And I certainly have never used it in my own kitchen.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Okay, so this is I had to really scour the shelves, which is why I was a little bit late coming in here this morning to try to find an ice cream that was not ultra processed. Let's see, where is the ingredient list? It's so small, I can't find it. Okay. Ingredients. Milk. Cane. Sugar. Cream. Cocoa powder. Processed with alkali. I don't know what that is. Tapioca syrup. Nonfat milk. That was the closest thing I could find to non-ultra processed. I don't know what the alkali thing is, so maybe that's still ultra processed. Here's the thing about these two, though. Does that make this one more healthy than that one?
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Right.

          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Kevin Hall doesn't think so. His hypothesis is that you're going to this is so hyper palatable. This is so energy dense. Even if it's minimally processed, it is going to drive you to eat to the same degree that the ultra processed ice cream is going to drive you to overeat. That's what his study is trying to figure out.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's really interesting. I think I think that's a it's a it's a great point to sort of leave things on that at the same time that, we may have these preconceived notions of just how, how problematic ultra processed foods are. Maybe there are other foods that may not be as processed that still have that, that really high energy density, that hyper palatability, that are still going to really make you eat. And kind of knowing yourself in this regard probably is maybe the most important thing. But a pleasure always, I always enjoyed, enjoy talking to you.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A measles outbreak in West Texas is continuing to spread. And with kindergarten vaccination rates dipping across the country, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/02/1198913177/measles-cases-are-up-and-childhood-vaccinations-are-down" target="_blank"&gt;more communities may be at risk of outbreaks.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But it's not just kids who should be vaccinated. Infectious disease experts say some adults may need to get revaccinated, too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Measles can spread incredibly fast — it's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5292478/measles-vaccination-kids-health-disease" target="_blank"&gt;one of the world's most contagious diseases&lt;/a&gt;, more than flu, polio, Covid, or just about any other infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Paul Offit,&lt;/a&gt; director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, notes that just last week, West Texas was reporting 14 cases. This week, it's up to 58 cases. "It's very hard to control measles," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The best defense against measles is vaccination. The vast majority of people getting sick in Texas are unvaccinated. And the measles vaccine is both safe and highly effective, says &lt;a href="https://wag.app.vanderbilt.edu/PublicPage/Faculty/Details/27990" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"If you have been vaccinated with two doses of vaccine as per routine, you have a 95-plus percent chance of being completely protected throughout your life," Schaffner says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But public health experts say there are some adults who should consider getting revaccinated. That includes older adults who were born after 1957 and were vaccinated before 1968. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's because early versions of the measles vaccine were made from an inactivated (killed) virus, which didn't work particularly well, Offit says. That's why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommends that anyone vaccinated before 1968&lt;/a&gt; get at least one dose of the live attenuated vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before the first measles vaccines were developed in the 1960s, nearly everyone got the disease during childhood. So people born before 1957 are assumed to have natural immunity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Schaffner says if you're not sure of your immunity or vaccination status, there's no harm in getting a shot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you were vaccinated between 1968 and 1989, you likely received just one dose of the measles vaccine, instead of the two doses that are standard today. One dose alone is highly effective and for most people, it provides more than enough protection, says Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/18/1232304335/booster-shots-measles" target="_blank"&gt;author of &lt;em&gt;Booster Shots&lt;/em&gt;, a book on the history of measles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But Ratner says there are several situations in which the CDC recommends an additional dose of measles vaccine for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;adults who are considered at high risk&lt;/a&gt;. That includes people who are in college settings, work in health care, live or are in close contact with immunocompromised people, or are travelling internationally.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"If you're traveling somewhere where there's an active outbreak and you're not sure that you got two doses, it may not be crazy to get a second dose," Ratner says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And if you live in a community which is experiencing a measles outbreak, your local or state health department may recommend a second dose for adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's worthwhile to make sure you're protected, because adults over 20 are more likely to develop &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html#:~:text=Severe%20complications%20in%20children%20and,low%2Dbirth%2Dweight%20baby." target="_blank"&gt;complications from measles&lt;/a&gt;, which can include pneumonia and brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And measles &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/18/780576486/samoa-closes-schools-and-mandates-vaccinations-amid-deadly-measles-epidemic" target="_blank"&gt;can also be dangerous — if not deadly — for children.&lt;/a&gt; As many as 1 in 20 kids with measles will get pneumonia, and 1 out of 1,000 will develop encephalitis, or brain swelling — which can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html#:~:text=Severe%20complications%20in%20children%20and,low%2Dbirth%2Dweight%20baby." target="_blank"&gt;lead to death or cause deafness or intellectual disabilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nationwide, kindergarten vaccination rates have fallen below the 95% threshold that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is needed to prevent community outbreaks. In some parts of the U.S., rates are far lower. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/19/g-s1-49648/up-first-newsletter-measles-west-texas-jair-bolsonaro-china-funding" target="_blank"&gt;That includes Gaines County&lt;/a&gt;, Texas, the epicenter of the state's outbreak, where the vaccination rate is only at about 80%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Offit says vaccination is the best way to protect children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I lived through the 1991 Philadelphia measles epidemic, where there were 1,400 cases and nine deaths over a period of three months," he says. "So I've seen children suffer needlessly because of the choice not to get a vaccine. So please, vaccinate your children."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited by Jane Greenhalgh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      
      Neuronal accumulation and spread of pathological α-synuclein (α-syn) fibrils are key events in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the uptake of α-syn fibrils remain unclear. In this work, we identified &lt;i&gt;FAM171A2&lt;/i&gt; as a PD risk gene that affects α-syn aggregation. Overexpressing FAM171A2 promotes α-syn fibril endocytosis and exacerbates the spread and neurotoxicity of α-syn pathology. Neuronal-specific knockdown of FAM171A2 expression shows protective effects. Mechanistically, the FAM171A2 extracellular domain 1 interacts with the α-syn C terminus through electrostatic forces, with &amp;gt;1000 times more selective for fibrils. Furthermore, we identified bemcentinib as an effective blocker of FAM171A2-α-syn fibril interaction with an in vitro binding assay, in cellular models, and in mice. Our findings identified FAM171A2 as a potential receptor for the neuronal uptake of α-syn fibrils and, thus, as a therapeutic target against PD.

&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key question for both farmers and government officials is how the virus gets onto farms in the first place. Some transmission routes—such as direct contact with wild birds, contaminated feed or drinking water, and movement by people through contaminated clothing or equipment—are well-documented, and biosecurity measures are taken at many farms to minimize exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, new research sheds light on an often-overlooked mechanism: windborne transmission. A &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.12.637829v1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.12.637829v1" aria-label="recent study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.12.637829v1"&gt;recent study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; presents compelling genetic and meteorological evidence that H5N1 can travel significant distances via wind, challenging the conventional wisdom and highlighting the need to reconsider outbreak mitigation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-1" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion classname="expandable" current="-1"&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;Screen shot from USDA APHIS website, February 20, 2025. &lt;span class="plus" data-ga-track="caption expand"&gt;... [+]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="expanded-caption"&gt; https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Genetic Evidence for an Epidemiological Link&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted after an outbreak of H5N1 in the Czech Republic in February 2024, examined how the virus spread from a duck farm to two chicken farms located approximately 8 km away. Genetic sequencing revealed striking similarities between the virus strains at these farms, with some isolates from the duck farm 100% identical to those found in the chicken farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, extensive field investigations ruled out several possible transmission routes. There were no direct interactions between the companies managing the farms, no contaminated feed or water sources, and no major water bodies nearby to facilitate spread via wild birds. The study also ruled out human-associated transmission and even rodent-mediated spread. Given these findings, wind emerged as the most plausible explanation for how the virus traveled between the farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Meteorological Correlation and Windborne Spread&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meteorological data provided further support for the windborne transmission hypothesis. Between February 4 and 7, prevailing winds blew consistently from the west or southwest (250–300 degrees), aligning with the suspected transmission route. Wind speeds averaged around 4 meters per second, with gusts reaching 8–10 meters per second on February 5. The study determined the optimal period for airborne viral transmission occurred from noon on February 4 to midnight on February 5. At these wind speeds, the virus could have made the distance between the two farms in just 13-22 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Airborne transmission, especially over distances of 8 km, is not typically considered a major route for H5N1 transmission. However, this study challenges that assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-2" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion classname="expandable" current="-1"&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;Map showing duck farm and chicken farms connected by windborne spread of H5N1 avian influenza. Map &lt;span class="plus" data-ga-track="caption expand"&gt;... [+]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="expanded-caption"&gt; drawn by E. Marty from data reported in a study of an outbreak in the Czech Republic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;Eric Marty&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Tunnel Ventilation Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant insights from the study is the role of tunnel ventilation systems in facilitating windborne spread. These ventilation systems function like high-volume air samplers, creating negative pressure inside poultry houses that draws in huge quantities of ambient air effectively concentrating whatever particulates may be in that air, in this case infectious virions of H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the infection period, ventilation rates at the affected chicken farms were exceptionally high. These conditions likely allowed airborne viral particles to accumulate and reach infectious doses. Notably, on the affected chicken farms, outbreaks in chicken houses began near air intake systems. On farm C, the researchers inferred that transmission between chicken houses likely originated in the house with the largest bird population and highest ventilation rate, making it the most plausible first recipient of airborne virus from farm B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implications for Outbreak Mitigation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study have significant implications for HPAI outbreak response and biosecurity measures. Conventionally, only dust generated during depopulation efforts has been considered a major risk factor for airborne transmission. However, this study suggests that aerosols produced by infected flocks may be more significant carriers of the virus, as heavier dust particles tend to settle quickly near the outbreak site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this new understanding of transmission dynamics, poultry farms and animal health officials should consider whether or not existing biosecurity protocols that focus on direct contact and contamination are adequate. Should airborne mitigation strategies now be considered, too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, more research is needed to determine if poultry houses with tunnel ventilation systems need additional filtration or air purification technologies to minimize airborne virus spread, especially in places where chicken farms are located close to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the study provides strong genetic and meteorological evidence for windborne transmission in this case, there are limitations to air sampling studies. Detecting minute concentrations of viral particles over long distances is challenging. The absence of detection in some studies does not necessarily rule out windborne spread, highlighting the need for continued research into the aerodynamics of viral transmission in poultry settings. In the meantime it’s worth reconsidering if airborne transmission might account for some of the incursions into otherwise biosecured facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study reshapes our understanding of H5N1 transmission, presenting robust evidence that windborne spread plays a larger role than previously recognized. By highlighting the role of tunnel ventilation systems and optimal wind conditions, the research underscores the need for enhanced airborne transmission control measures.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;When you've eaten a good meal at a restaurant and the waiter asks, "Got any room for dessert?" where does the voice that craves a gratuitous slice of pie come from? &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Your brain. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists now have a better understanding of the neural origins of this urge thanks to a new study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp1510"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mice brains are structurally similar to human brains. So, to isolate the neural pathways responsible for "dessert brain," the researchers turned to mice. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research fed mice to the point of fullness and then gave them sugar. In doing so, they found that the same neurons signaling satiety, or fullness, also released β-Endorphin, a naturally-occurring opiate. This chemical bound to opiate receptors in the mice brains and triggered a feeling of reward. When the team then blocked this opiate pathway, the mice stayed away from the sugar. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The researchers found the same neural mechanism in humans when studying donated brain tissue and scanning the brains of volunteers. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cecad.uni-koeln.de/research/principal-investigators/full-members/henning-fenselau"&gt;Henning Fenselau&lt;/a&gt;, one of the study authors, says this suggests that people's brains evolved to love sugar in excess. "Because sugar is so easy to metabolize, its consumption beyond energy needs is favorable for animals," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the team hopes this research can lead to a better understanding of sugar overconsumption, obesity and more sophisticated weight-loss drugs. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want us to cover more neuroscience on the show?

Then doctors said it was long Covid. She was branded an antivaxxer for suggesting it could have been the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thousands of Americans have reported similar stories. &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14414367/covid-vaccines-new-syndrome-biological-changes-yale.html"&gt;After the study news dropped,&lt;/a&gt; DailyMail.com spoke to dozens of Americans, including those in healthcare, law, and the military, who said they felt a sense of validation after years of being dismissed as crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Trevor Keyler, a 39-year-old biology professor from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/minnesota/index.html" id="mol-a92d76a0-efdb-11ef-af33-b359746a4595"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; who describes himself as 'pro-vaccine' and 'pro-science', has been forced to cut his work hours after suffering extreme tremors and fatigue and partial blindness following his Moderna vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For years doctors told him his symptoms were not related to the vaccine and were probably Covid itself or long Covid. The doctor, who said he used to be a 'very healthy' and outdoorsy person, can no longer hike with his wife and two children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mRNA vaccines made by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/moderna/index.html" id="mol-329bef00-efd4-11ef-91cc-f3d1ccaa269c"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pfizer/index.html" id="mol-329bef01-efd4-11ef-91cc-f3d1ccaa269c" class=""&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; are estimated &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10944873/Covid-vaccines-saved-nearly-20MILLION-lives-year-worlds-roll-out.html"&gt;to have saved tens of millions of lives globally from Covid,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; including 3million in the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But experts have said the push to quell damaging anti-vax misinformation has left those with genuine &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-13826177/fit-mum-Covid-vaccine.html"&gt;post-vaccination injuries&lt;/a&gt; treated like outcasts.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lindy Ayers, 31, is wheelchair bound after doctors diagnosed her with a Covid vaccine injury, she told DailyMail.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Ayers had just completed a triathalon (she is seen biking at left) months before passing out and becoming paralyzed. She is seen at right after her injury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the small study, Yale researchers found patients with previously unknown 'post-vaccination syndrome' show distinct biological changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common symptoms appear to be brain fog, dizziness, tinnitus and exercise intolerance, a feeling of exhaustion after limited exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In patients with the syndrome, the vaccine also appears to awaken a dormant virus known as Epstein–Barr and interfere with people's immune systems in complicated ways still being studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, people with the post-vaccination condition had high levels of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/coronavirus/index.html" id="mol-be458950-efd7-11ef-af33-b359746a4595" class=""&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; proteins in their blood, years after taking the shot, which could leave their bodies in a permanent state of inflammation, causing a host of other problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Yale experts emphasized the results 'are still a work in progress' (for example, it's not clear how common the condition is) but they highlighted a need for further studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Ayers believes she has the syndrome. She was at peak physical performance when she received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine in September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two months later, she was reliant on a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors dismissed the symptoms as anxiety and prescribed antidepressants, but Mrs Ayers told DailyMail.com  her condition soon started 'rapidly declining.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her regular 10-mile runs and 20-mile bike rides quickly dwindled, and she suffered muscle tears, including in her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During an art class, Mrs Ayers passed out. She said: 'I couldn't see. I couldn't hear. I've been in a wheelchair ever since.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For a year and a half, doctors assumed she had long Covid due to elevated levels of spike proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Trevor Keyler, a biology professor in Minnesota, was an avid mountain biker when he developed cataracts and tremors after his Moderna vaccine. He is pictured at left before the injury and at right after &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kari Ponce de Leon, 43, from Montana, told DailyMail.com she developed low platelets and red spots after her Pfizer shot in 2021. She was later diagnosed with hemolytic anemia and Evans syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Persistent spike proteins in the body are thought to cause some of long Covid's symptoms - fatigue, brain fog - by keeping the body in a constant state of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't until 2023, two years after receiving the vaccine, that doctors at the Veteran's Affairs and Stanford University diagnosed Mrs Ayers with 'chronic fatigue' from the vaccine residuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Ayers was also positive for reactivated Epstein-Barr syndrome, much like the patients in the Yale study.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Doctors told me there's nothing else they can do for me and to just rest. They would say stuff like "You could die in seven months, or you could live the rest of your life like this. We don't know what's going to happen to you. We don't know what's wrong with you."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Ayers spent another eight months bedbound and unable to speak, and her husband, who is also a Coast Guard veteran, had to take leave to care for her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I get these crashes where if I try to take care of myself, my body shuts down and I'm in so much pain. I can't even lift my arms.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Mrs Ayers has seen slight improvements, such as being able to sit up, she worries about being taken seriously.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm not an anti-vaccine person. I think vaccines help people, but I think this specific vaccine hurt a lot of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It'd be cool if more people understood that it can hurt people so that more doctors will research and they'll have a cure for what I'm going through.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Since the injury, the father-of-two (pictured here with his family) has been forced to cut back his hours as a researcher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Erica Evers, a 42-year-old former legal compliance worker from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/iowa/index.html" id="mol-c06b7ef0-efc9-11ef-91cc-f3d1ccaa269c" class=""&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, was reluctant to take the Moderna vaccine when her employers mandated it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she told DailyMail.com she would have risked losing her job and her health insurance, which she needed to pay for treatment for her son's chronic health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I had to choose between his life and my own. It's not a choice when you're a mother.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The day after her first dose, Mrs Evers developed blurry vision in her right eye, and she couldn't see anything directly in front of her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was absolutely terrifying. I felt very unsafe,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This worsened after her second dose, leading Mrs Evers to seek out an eye doctor specializing in the retina, the tissue at the back of the eye that helps the brain interpret light signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor diagnosed Mrs Evers with a retinal hemorrhage, or bleeding at the back of the eye, which is treated with monthly injections in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around the same time, she developed tinnitus, a persistent ringing in the ears, which caused hearing loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MRI scans showed Mrs Evers had swelling in her brain, which has been shown to cause vision and hearing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, doctors told her all three issues were likely unrelated and didn't explain what may have caused them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I kept asking them if it was the vaccine, and the big hospitals kept saying, "No, absolutely not.

For the sake of my wife's career, it was something I was willing to do.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The father-of-one almost immediately felt as if he gained 'Spidey Senses' after his second dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Snowden said: 'Lights were brighter. I could hear things across the room that I normally couldn't hear. Everything was more vivid.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soon after, he developed 'frequencies' in his ear, which he compares to fax machine sounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors dismissed Mr Snowden's symptoms until 2023, when he suddenly developed an irregular heartbeat that made him feel like he was having a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Evers also has non-cancerous but unexplained lesions on her brain, which she believes are from the vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Evers, pictured here, said: 'We're just left here to rot.

We're just left here to die.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I can't bend down and stand up without feeling like I'm losing a grip on consciousness. It literally feels like sometimes my brain is being starved of oxygen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I can't walk up and down stairs without actually grabbing onto the banister because at any time I might get a dizzy spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just never know what's going to happen. I'm scared to be left home alone. You just resign yourself to the fact that your days are numbered.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Dr Keyer's case, the Minnesota professor received his Moderna shot in 2021 and he says it triggered a cascade of health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He battled with extreme fatigue and weakness for a year. In March 2022, Dr Keyler developed blood clots in his right kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In July 2022, doctors diagnosed Dr Keyler with rhabdomyolysis - a breakdown of muscle tissue that causes the release of a protein called myoglobin, which gets filtered through the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can break down kidney cells and damage the organs. In half of rhabdomyolysis cases, people experience kidney complications similar to Dr Keyler's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The professor also developed cataracts - a condition that normally affects elderly people but can also develop due to kidney damage. Studies have shown a significant association between the two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Keyler told this website: 'I couldn't stand for more than 20 minutes at a time without being completely exhausted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So I ended up taking a partial leave from work, and then it was just other things kept popping up, like my vision started to deteriorate.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Ayers, pictured here, told this website she wishes vaccines were treated like 'any other medicine' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Keyler said while he plans to get his children most vaccines, he is cautious about giving them Covid shots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a search for answers, Dr Keyler approached a specialist at Mayo Clinic who could not find an answer to the professor's ailments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts at the Mayo Clinic believe the multiple conditions Dr Keyler was suffering from were due to post-Covid syndrome, but he believes it was due to his Moderna vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When asked if there is anything he wish for doctors across the country to know about his experience, he said: 'In general, they need to believe what their patients are saying and when they don't know, not come up with something completely wild out in left field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was misdiagnosed with so many things along the way and some of them were pretty serious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think they realize it now, but just how debilitating [the experience] can be, and for people to try to even seek help when they're feeling like that is, I know it was very difficult.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 07:00:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Vaccine victims left disabled after taking Covid jab react to bombshell Yale study that found shots cause extr - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi9gFBVV95cUxPYjhLb1d2YktNV2sybTdSQmxYQlZoZ1pQLUhhVzNHYTJIZjlfWUVjTUsyM1JPZWVZSVJocXlOeGxZamtVUncwang1YmZncFZ5VmlvaWJTa291SGZQaVlzY3REb19BTDF2Q0RBX2R2VEtXYWFfQ3NuS0kzdG9yeWhIVnR2NWV4ZUZ1RzhrNUNiMWhBbFdaWFRlaTNFTzRXelphTU12RVFDNjVUdzd6cFNJV19NeFVYZTJCVzdBd1l3UElNYXJIWWQ1Y3ZWS1BHMDFudHZiNllWS1lNcWRZQ0RKdHliTmFlSi1CeWhJMnRtSjFwM01TWWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When a new Yale University study identified a debilitating syndrome linked to Covid vaccines, Lindy Ayers breathed a sigh of relief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 31-year-old Army veteran, from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/arkansas/index.html" id="mol-9e389f20-efd8-11ef-af33-b359746a4595" class=""&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;, has been wheelchair-bound since she took her second Pfizer shot in 2021 as part of the government's military mandate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For years she was told her extreme fatigue, sickness and heart palpitations were anxiety. Then doctors said it was long Covid. She was branded an antivaxxer for suggesting it could have been the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thousands of Americans have reported similar stories. &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14414367/covid-vaccines-new-syndrome-biological-changes-yale.html"&gt;After the study news dropped,&lt;/a&gt; DailyMail.com spoke to dozens of Americans, including those in healthcare, law, and the military, who said they felt a sense of validation after years of being dismissed as crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Trevor Keyler, a 39-year-old biology professor from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/minnesota/index.html" id="mol-a92d76a0-efdb-11ef-af33-b359746a4595"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; who describes himself as 'pro-vaccine' and 'pro-science', has been forced to cut his work hours after suffering extreme tremors and fatigue and partial blindness following his Moderna vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For years doctors told him his symptoms were not related to the vaccine and were probably Covid itself or long Covid. The doctor, who said he used to be a 'very healthy' and outdoorsy person, can no longer hike with his wife and two children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mRNA vaccines made by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/moderna/index.html" id="mol-329bef00-efd4-11ef-91cc-f3d1ccaa269c"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pfizer/index.html" id="mol-329bef01-efd4-11ef-91cc-f3d1ccaa269c" class=""&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; are estimated &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10944873/Covid-vaccines-saved-nearly-20MILLION-lives-year-worlds-roll-out.html"&gt;to have saved tens of millions of lives globally from Covid,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; including 3million in the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But experts have said the push to quell damaging anti-vax misinformation has left those with genuine &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-13826177/fit-mum-Covid-vaccine.html"&gt;post-vaccination injuries&lt;/a&gt; treated like outcasts.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lindy Ayers, 31, is wheelchair bound after doctors diagnosed her with a Covid vaccine injury, she told DailyMail.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Ayers had just completed a triathalon (she is seen biking at left) months before passing out and becoming paralyzed. She is seen at right after her injury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the small study, Yale researchers found patients with previously unknown 'post-vaccination syndrome' show distinct biological changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common symptoms appear to be brain fog, dizziness, tinnitus and exercise intolerance, a feeling of exhaustion after limited exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In patients with the syndrome, the vaccine also appears to awaken a dormant virus known as Epstein–Barr and interfere with people's immune systems in complicated ways still being studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, people with the post-vaccination condition had high levels of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/coronavirus/index.html" id="mol-be458950-efd7-11ef-af33-b359746a4595" class=""&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; proteins in their blood, years after taking the shot, which could leave their bodies in a permanent state of inflammation, causing a host of other problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Yale experts emphasized the results 'are still a work in progress' (for example, it's not clear how common the condition is) but they highlighted a need for further studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Ayers believes she has the syndrome. She was at peak physical performance when she received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine in September 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two months later, she was reliant on a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors dismissed the symptoms as anxiety and prescribed antidepressants, but Mrs Ayers told DailyMail.com  her condition soon started 'rapidly declining.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her regular 10-mile runs and 20-mile bike rides quickly dwindled, and she suffered muscle tears, including in her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During an art class, Mrs Ayers passed out. She said: 'I couldn't see. I couldn't hear. I've been in a wheelchair ever since.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For a year and a half, doctors assumed she had long Covid due to elevated levels of spike proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Trevor Keyler, a biology professor in Minnesota, was an avid mountain biker when he developed cataracts and tremors after his Moderna vaccine. He is pictured at left before the injury and at right after &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kari Ponce de Leon, 43, from Montana, told DailyMail.com she developed low platelets and red spots after her Pfizer shot in 2021. She was later diagnosed with hemolytic anemia and Evans syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Persistent spike proteins in the body are thought to cause some of long Covid's symptoms - fatigue, brain fog - by keeping the body in a constant state of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't until 2023, two years after receiving the vaccine, that doctors at the Veteran's Affairs and Stanford University diagnosed Mrs Ayers with 'chronic fatigue' from the vaccine residuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Ayers was also positive for reactivated Epstein-Barr syndrome, much like the patients in the Yale study.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Doctors told me there's nothing else they can do for me and to just rest. They would say stuff like "You could die in seven months, or you could live the rest of your life like this. We don't know what's going to happen to you. We don't know what's wrong with you."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Ayers spent another eight months bedbound and unable to speak, and her husband, who is also a Coast Guard veteran, had to take leave to care for her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I get these crashes where if I try to take care of myself, my body shuts down and I'm in so much pain. I can't even lift my arms.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Mrs Ayers has seen slight improvements, such as being able to sit up, she worries about being taken seriously.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm not an anti-vaccine person. I think vaccines help people, but I think this specific vaccine hurt a lot of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It'd be cool if more people understood that it can hurt people so that more doctors will research and they'll have a cure for what I'm going through.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Since the injury, the father-of-two (pictured here with his family) has been forced to cut back his hours as a researcher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Erica Evers, a 42-year-old former legal compliance worker from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/iowa/index.html" id="mol-c06b7ef0-efc9-11ef-91cc-f3d1ccaa269c" class=""&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt;, was reluctant to take the Moderna vaccine when her employers mandated it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she told DailyMail.com she would have risked losing her job and her health insurance, which she needed to pay for treatment for her son's chronic health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I had to choose between his life and my own. It's not a choice when you're a mother.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The day after her first dose, Mrs Evers developed blurry vision in her right eye, and she couldn't see anything directly in front of her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was absolutely terrifying. I felt very unsafe,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This worsened after her second dose, leading Mrs Evers to seek out an eye doctor specializing in the retina, the tissue at the back of the eye that helps the brain interpret light signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor diagnosed Mrs Evers with a retinal hemorrhage, or bleeding at the back of the eye, which is treated with monthly injections in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around the same time, she developed tinnitus, a persistent ringing in the ears, which caused hearing loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MRI scans showed Mrs Evers had swelling in her brain, which has been shown to cause vision and hearing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, doctors told her all three issues were likely unrelated and didn't explain what may have caused them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I kept asking them if it was the vaccine, and the big hospitals kept saying, "No, absolutely not. The shots are safe and effective." They couldn't diagnose what was happening to me. '&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Erica Evers, 42, suffered blurry vision and bleeding behind the eye after her vaccine.

Studies have shown a significant association between the two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Keyler told this website: 'I couldn't stand for more than 20 minutes at a time without being completely exhausted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So I ended up taking a partial leave from work, and then it was just other things kept popping up, like my vision started to deteriorate.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Ayers, pictured here, told this website she wishes vaccines were treated like 'any other medicine' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Keyler said while he plans to get his children most vaccines, he is cautious about giving them Covid shots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a search for answers, Dr Keyler approached a specialist at Mayo Clinic who could not find an answer to the professor's ailments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts at the Mayo Clinic believe the multiple conditions Dr Keyler was suffering from were due to post-Covid syndrome, but he believes it was due to his Moderna vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When asked if there is anything he wish for doctors across the country to know about his experience, he said: 'In general, they need to believe what their patients are saying and when they don't know, not come up with something completely wild out in left field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was misdiagnosed with so many things along the way and some of them were pretty serious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think they realize it now, but just how debilitating [the experience] can be, and for people to try to even seek help when they're feeling like that is, I know it was very difficult.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 07:00:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9gFBVV95cUxPYjhLb1d2YktNV2sybTdSQmxYQlZoZ1pQLUhhVzNHYTJIZjlfWUVjTUsyM1JPZWVZSVJocXlOeGxZamtVUncwang1YmZncFZ5VmlvaWJTa291SGZQaVlzY3REb19BTDF2Q0RBX2R2VEtXYWFfQ3NuS0kzdG9yeWhIVnR2NWV4ZUZ1RzhrNUNiMWhBbFdaWFRlaTNFTzRXelphTU12RVFDNjVUdzd6cFNJV19NeFVYZTJCVzdBd1l3UElNYXJIWWQ1Y3ZWS1BHMDFudHZiNllWS1lNcWRZQ0RKdHliTmFlSi1CeWhJMnRtSjFwM01TWWc</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu's potential threat to humans: Tower Health doctor describes risk level - 69News WFMZ-TV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi9wFBVV95cUxObWJWT0VieHhsTmV1TlZ1Q2JQYlJ5a1JmNzJlanFCc0s4Tjg3bUM3N0dmMERqY19QRGcwZ1pjZW5IcjdnTkxIRkZ0V3lGa3BvalVVVkF3QkdIY0hjamVyR2praE55dnNuczQ3eXZJbWNpNkV2OFdFNTRmcFMwUXFsOTIzX3g3QXpIRXRpZXhjcEJxYktLN2xBanUtX2JOYVlpRFVYSlVqVE4wY3kwbjNKUHAzZ3RILU5SMlZrLTNObzl0YVZCVmZFYTM0S2g4VWJvVHVzVVJ0Zlgxa21FZmF6Y2dsVzZqLVZ4QkZTZ1J5T01YZlN5Vy1R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;BERKS COUNTY, Pa. – Bird flu, also known as avian flu, is wreaking havoc on the poultry population and the price of eggs. As of now, though, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the threat of a public health risk remains low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately, we're not seeing any in Pennsylvania," said Dr. Grace Kim, an infectious disease specialist with Tower Health. "As of yesterday, there were 68 human cases, and there are 69 so far."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said of the 69 people, most have had mild symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The avian flu is just like any mild flu, so you can have the runny nose, sore throat, cough, but what's different is the irritation of the eye," Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim said the people most at risk of contracting the virus are those who work closely with farm animals. She said, so far, there have been no reported cases of human-to-human spread. But she said said scientists are watching closely to make sure the virus doesn't mutate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's where the concern is, where if that should happen, in that it can turn into an outbreak," Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the best way to contain the virus is to try to minimize the spread among animals and protect yourself if you do work closely with farm animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Use proper protective equipment, whether they use an N95 or a mask if they have one available," she said. "If they're in the farm industry, the employee should be providing proper equipment for them to take care of farm animals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Kim said people should be more worried about another flu: influenza A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, using this avian flu as a soap box for the seasonal flu, which is horrible," she said. "And the rates, even as they are trending down this week, we are still higher than what our worst was last year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The body is able to absorb nutrients from food better than supplements, so I always recommend starting with foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamins can fill the gaps if you don’t eat enough plant-based foods with vitamin C, but “mega-doses” of the nutrient won’t prevent most people from getting sick, she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, people who already have a vitamin C deficiency may lower their risk of getting a cold by getting plenty of the nutrient, registered dietitian Carol Johnston, Ph.D., who is an expert on vitamin C metabolism, previously told TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The powerful antioxidant also protects cells from damage and is important for healthy skin, bones, teeth and gums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended daily intake of vitamin C is 90 milligrams for men and 75 milligrams for women, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. Children need less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safe upper limit is 2,000 milligrams a day, though the nutrient doesn’t cause serious problems even at high doses, the NIH notes. The body flushes out excess vitamin C in urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citrus is famous for vitamin C, but other fruits deliver even more of the nutrient. Here are nine fruits highest in vitamin C:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bell peppers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 yellow bell pepper, 342 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 red bell pepper, 210 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 green bell pepper, 132 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprise! You may think of them as vegetables, but bell peppers are officially classified as fruits and they are vitamin C superstars, especially the yellow kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red bell peppers are one of Rizzo’s favorite &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-snack-boost-immune-system-rcna182453" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:snacks to boost the immune system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;snacks to boost the immune system&lt;/a&gt; during cold and flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re naturally low in calories and fat and provide fiber. In addition to vitamin C, they contain vitamin A, B vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorful, sweet and crunchy, they can be sliced and then dipped in hummus or tzatziki for a filling snack, Rizzo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guava&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sweet tropical fruit contains almost double the amount of vitamin C found in an orange, plus &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/guava-benefits-rcna173418" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:guava;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;guava&lt;/a&gt; is very high in antioxidants, potassium and fiber.

It also contains a bit of iron and calcium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pineapple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians are impressed by &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/pineapple-benefits-rcna152025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pineapple;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pineapple&lt;/a&gt;’s high vitamin C content, especially since it helps the body absorb plant sources of iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So as people are transitioning to more of a plant-based way of eating, sometimes having extra vitamin C can help your body absorb iron from foods like spinach or beans to make sure you’re not deficient in iron,” Sarah Rivenburgh, a registered dietitian at OhioHealth, previously told TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pineapple also contains insoluble fiber, or roughage, which helps to keep the bowels moving regularly; and bromelain, an enzyme that breaks down proteins and has anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Citrus fruits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 medium orange, 68 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;½ grapefruit, 45 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 small tangerines, 40 milligrams of vitamin C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/calories-in-an-orange-rcna57154" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Oranges;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Oranges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/grapefruit-benefits-rcna186537" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:grapefruits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;grapefruits&lt;/a&gt; and tangerines are a go-to source of vitamin C for many people. They’re in season in winter and spring, making them peak choices during cold and flu months. Tangerines are an especially portable, tasty, juicy, easy-to-peel snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s best to eat the whole fruit to get vitamin C rather than drinking the juice, Rizzo advises. You’ll get the fiber for satiety and gut health, including &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22190137/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pectin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pectin&lt;/a&gt;, a type of fiber found in the membranes and pith of citrus fruits that can help lower cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kiwi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet-tart with a distinct bright green color, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/kiwi-benefits-rcna172695" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kiwis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;kiwis&lt;/a&gt; are “exceptionally high in vitamin C” and contain good amounts of fiber, potassium, vitamin E, folate and antioxidants, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6267416/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actinidin, a natural enzyme unique to kiwifruit breaks down protein, which helps with digestion, researchers note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating kiwis may even &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21669584/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improve sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;improve sleep&lt;/a&gt; because they contain serotonin, a neurotransmitter that’s involved in sleep-wake cycles, one study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mango&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tasty, rich in vitamin C and full of soluble fiber — the type that turns into a gel in the digestive tract — &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/mango-benefits-rcna148830" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mango;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mango&lt;/a&gt; is also one of the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/fruits-with-high-sugar-rcna189181" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fruits highest in sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fruits highest in sugar&lt;/a&gt; for healthy energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitian Samantha Cassetty includes mangoes on her list of the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-fruits-rcna139553" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:15 healthiest fruits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;15 healthiest fruits&lt;/a&gt; because of their carotenoid compounds, which give mangoes their golden color and provide health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cantaloupe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/cantaloupe-vs-honeydew-rcna163065" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cantaloupe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cantaloupe&lt;/a&gt; is a hydrating, low-calorie fruit that’s high in both vitamin C and A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also low in sugar and high in protein for a fruit.

This is because &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; can help us “stay vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades”, says Ollie Thompson, personal trainer and founder of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://welltolead.com/"&gt;Welltolead&lt;/a&gt;, a performance-focused health coaching company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, the benefits of maintaining healthy muscle are highly underrated,” he says. “Resistance training is crucial for long-term &lt;a href="/news/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; – not just from a movement perspective, staying physically strong and mobile, but also for maintaining overall physiological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent resistance training enhances metabolic function by improving insulin sensitivity, supports cardiovascular health by reducing &lt;a href="/topic/blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, helps maintain hormonal balance to combat age-related declines, preserves bone density to reduce fracture risk, and strengthens the immune system to help fight off disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to help you build strength, Thompson has shared three &lt;a href="/topic/gyms"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; exercises he believes hold the most value if training for &lt;a href="/topic/longevity"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; is your goal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-2 epFywa EqCSl"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assisted chin-up &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bulgarian split squat &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farmer’s carry &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 kULwBk fWblEi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on my experience, if we define longevity as living better for longer – with an emphasis on staying vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades – then these are the top three gym exercises for longevity,” says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, they can strengthen muscles across your upper and lower body, boosting joint health, developing balance and coordination, and improving your posture, among other perks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/anne-hathaway-workout-trainer-plank-b2695184.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This one-move workout from Anne Hathaway’s trainer builds core stability in just three minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do an assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-18072"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place a barbell in a rack at roughly chest height. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit on the ground under the barbell then reach overhead and grasp it with an underhand grip, hands roughly shoulder-width apart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your feet on the floor for support, pull your body upwards until your chin is above the bar. Think about squeezing your shoulder blades together as you do this. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly control yourself back to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over time, try to provide less support with your feet to make the exercise more challenging, in line with your increasing strength levels. You can also use an assisted pull-up machine or resistance band to perform this exercise. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/courteney-cox-chin-up-workout-b2625004.html"&gt;chin-up&lt;/a&gt; has a somewhat intimidating reputation. But by using a machine, resistance band or even a lower pull-up bar and supporting yourself with your feet, Thompson says it can be scaled to suit most fitness levels. And adding it to your regular routine unlocks plenty of benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up not only recruits multiple muscles across your back, biceps, forearms and core, but it’s also one of the best things you can do to develop a healthy set of shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One key reason I picked the assisted chin-up is that performing a full repetition – from a dead hang to the top with your chin at the bar – takes your shoulder blades through a full range of motion,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the bottom hanging position, with your hands supinated [palms towards you], you create external rotation at the shoulder joint while under load with your arms overhead – an excellent way to maintain strong, stable and well-functioning shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, this exercise can’t be beaten for training grip strength, which &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6778477/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have strongly correlated with healthier muscle mass and better longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/stanley-tucci-workout-b2630043.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley Tucci got into the ‘best shape of his life’ at 63 with this training method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-18073"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand one step in front of a bench or sturdy surface that’s around knee height. Face away from this surface. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in your left hand with your arm by your side, palm facing your body. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your right leg long and your hips square, place the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your left knee until it’s just above the ground, keeping your chest up as you do this, then drive through your right foot to return to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up promises to strengthen multiple muscles across your upper body, and the Bulgarian split squat mirrors this for your lower half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a unilateral [single-limb] exercise, it’s excellent for building strength and stability at the hip, knee and foot, helping to correct severe muscular imbalances while also incorporating a balance component,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also challenges kinaesthetic awareness – your ability to sense your position and movement in space – which is a crucial skill for preventing trips and falls in later life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some impressive longevity credentials, and the Bulgarian split squat has another trick up its sleeve that elevates it above standard &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-squat-correctly-b2606171.html"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, in Thompson’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a huge fan of this exercise because, when performed correctly, it not only engages every major muscle in the leg but also forces you into hip extension,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This position, where the leg moves behind the hip and midline, tends to weaken significantly with age. Developing strength and mobility in this range plays a key role in maintaining movement quality and walking mechanics, and it can also be instrumental in reducing back pain, hip pain and dysfunction in these areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps a day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the farmer’s carry &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-18074"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in each hand with your arms by your side and your palms facing inwards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining an upright torso and tight core, walk with the weights. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the farmer’s carry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farmer’s carry is a refreshingly straightforward exercise: simply pick up a couple of &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-dumbbells-home-hand-weights-b1847563.html"&gt;dumbbells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-kettlebell-set-workout-b1837551.html"&gt;kettlebells&lt;/a&gt; and take them for a walk. This simplicity means it’s overlooked, but Thompson says those who omit it are missing out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The farmer’s carry is an exercise I don’t see performed nearly as often as it should be. Here’s why: it’s a full-body movement that involves ambulation, it tests your grip strength and it’s fantastic for improving posture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It builds strong joints, enhances hip stability, challenges your balance, coordination and kinaesthetic awareness, and ultimately provides a brilliant way to build strength while also taxing your aerobic system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it will bolster your heart and lung health by having you breathing heavily, while also strengthening your entire body. The farmer’s carry is a viable option for the vast majority of people too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often prescribe farmer's carries to my online clients because they are incredibly accessible and can be scaled easily, with progress easily tracked. Simply pick a challenging kettlebell or dumbbell, then walk for time, distance, steps or breaths. This way, you can keep track of how your performance improves over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/kettlebell-training-loaded-carries-b2691274.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘This will change your life’ – An expert strength coach shares the training method missing from your workouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other things to consider when training for longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training is Thompson’s top recommendation when exercising for longevity. But he says cardiovascular exercise – activities that raise your heart rate for a sustained period – should also be among your top priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiovascular exercise is, of course, essential for heart health, but it also plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, reducing the risk of major diseases and cancers, supporting brain health, enhancing energy production, improving sleep quality and managing stress,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As well as resistance training, a well-rounded approach to exercising for longevity includes both low-intensity zone two cardio [performed at roughly 60-70 per cent of your maximum heart rate] and short bouts of high-intensity training. This combination builds both a wide aerobic base and a high aerobic peak – known as VO2 max – which is strongly associated with better health, longevity, and reduced all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/isle-of-man-wellness-retreat-b2696904.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I went on my first wellness retreat, and it wasn’t what I expected at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQY0RBMElfMWwyb28yRVQ0N2c2X1htNy1Ha3FvUXJld05ESU1GUFR6X1RybmlnMi1UZjF1UGh2YUlvQ3V3RmtYN1lnZGZpVnBpemNYVXNHc0pXZnc1TXQwdWxDZE4yQmh4alpfTC1yTTI1XzMyX2h3eHJBTE9NcHAyQ21KLTRNemlHTkgtYXBNcUMwUkp4czh0eFNNejkwd1VYWVFPMWpB</guid></item><item><title>US doctor explains how just 10 minutes of walking can increase life span - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi_AFBVV95cUxPbTYyb29oRjRrMUotTVEyRjktcXhYcE4xaVIyaTNmOXdwTkxQR1Q2eXY5eTRLeXBTb3hjbVpDMXZ3emJPQ2FTMTJ3dVBKYmxGQklfRW1OcGxtOTg1RzI4eHEzV2V6NFdzbDNOUnRrTGJQX1VhRl9hMWZieEt4YmcySE8tZWY4R196TDE4UzdVYWxHdy1KdzFlSXFEWndYVE9rM05lYWQ0TW1UNFV5WnpSQXdkdjJ2dUJ0dm9ZSDBVNXQ0Q2Q0VEJiWEhNODctYkZyM2VudzJ2emdNQ0FSUDh4U1dJYm5yVkZSOXJ2X0JNUjJscEpBQW5tWEdHNl_SAYICQVVfeXFMTTRUVWZuNVpKNnJCckpXZkx3VjNYVGRBRVlKakp2QWlLdTZ1TEp3YVh1bUlTcTVidVpONlBOYWlrUzZzb3dKeEdFZ1FwUUs0VjJMS1ZPVGlCR1pOYm9jT2FGakhickFGeU9vLUVRYzBYTmx4ZXAxdEwyTDBJdHlTSGhZR3lRVXVZOEhYYUdmRGtCTDhnbmxLdkRfRTNaZGk2QUpCQmxUZ3NCQ0hxZ2Z0Q2VVTzh1eGpoVDFlN3hSQW1NQjZrWUJ5UWVKN2hJQnVPQ2lRWWduWUwzSUg4aWZVVFNVaWR2YXhGM0ZCYWc3bnl5TXZvX2J4RGpqN29tckR4cHNR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity has a deep impact on the overall well being including the longevity of an individual. Several studies have suggested the importance of daily movement for as small as just a few minutes in controlling the important parameters of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Cleveland Clinic's Senior Medical Advisor, Mark Hyman took to Instagram to share the findings of two important studies and to aware his fans and followers about the importance of walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“Daily movement isn’t just about fitness; it’s about longevity”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing the highlights of the study, the expert writes, "A study published in The Lancet followed 47,000 people over seven years and found that walking can significantly lower the risk of death. For adults 60 and older, the greatest benefits were seen at 6,000 to 8,000 steps per day. For adults under 60, the sweet spot was 8,000 to 10,000 steps per day. Daily movement isn’t just about fitness; it’s about longevity. Start where you are and build from there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mark’s post has received positive feedback from his followers. "Love this reminder! Every step adds up to a healthier, longer life. Time to lace up and get moving! Who’s in?," writes one user. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Could not be agreed more! My homework to the couples is to take a short walk at least for 10 min around the block whenever you feel out of control. It is so important to remind ourselves we are humans and we are not perfect. Getting angry, triggered, and misunderstood by everyone there specifically our partner is part of life. But how we choose to respond to our own triggers and emotions is the key to have a more blanched and more satisfying life. As a couple and relationship therapist I always emphasize the importance of pause, process and precede. Taking few minutes walk not only help out with physical health but also calm our nervous system down so was can come back with clarity and calm to our partner," writes a therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Power walking is a faster-paced form of walking that offers enhanced health benefits compared to regular walking. By maintaining a speed of 4 to 5.5 mph, power walking boosts cardiovascular fitness, burns more calories, and strengthens muscles. It improves posture, engages the core, and enhances endurance without the impact of running. This low-impact exercise reduces the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and joint issues while promoting weight loss and mental well-being. Incorporating arm movements and proper posture maximizes its benefits. Power walking is an effective and accessible way to improve overall health and maintain an active lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does walking help boost health?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is one of the simplest yet most effective forms of exercise. It requires no special equipment, can be done anywhere, and offers numerous health benefits. Whether it’s a brisk morning walk or a relaxed evening stroll, walking consistently can greatly enhance physical and mental well-being. Studies have shown that regular walkers tend to live longer and healthier lives. Walking reduces the risk of chronic diseases, improves mobility, and enhances overall quality of life, making it a key factor in healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking strengthens the heart by improving circulation, reducing bad cholesterol (LDL), and increasing good cholesterol (HDL). Regular walking lowers the risk of heart diseases, high blood pressure, and stroke. Just 30 minutes a day can significantly improve heart health and boost overall endurance. For individuals with diabetes or those at risk, walking helps regulate blood sugar levels. A short walk after meals can enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar spikes, making it an excellent habit for diabetes management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is an effective way to burn calories and maintain a healthy weight. A brisk 30-minute walk can burn between 150-200 calories, depending on body weight and speed. It also helps in improving metabolism, making it easier to manage weight without the stress of intense workouts. It engages various muscles, including the legs, core, and back. It helps maintain bone density, reducing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking, especially in nature, reduces stress, anxiety, and depression. It stimulates the release of endorphins, the body’s natural mood boosters. Walking in fresh air and green surroundings can also improve concentration, creativity, and overall mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking stimulates the immune system, helping the body fight infections. Studies suggest that people who walk regularly have a lower risk of colds, flu, and other illnesses. Walking enhances circulation, which allows immune cells to move more efficiently throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular walking can improve sleep quality by reducing stress and balancing circadian rhythms. It helps in managing insomnia and contributes to more restful and uninterrupted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A post-meal walk aids digestion by enhancing gut motility and reducing bloating. Walking after meals can also help prevent acid reflux and promote overall gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_AFBVV95cUxPbTYyb29oRjRrMUotTVEyRjktcXhYcE4xaVIyaTNmOXdwTkxQR1Q2eXY5eTRLeXBTb3hjbVpDMXZ3emJPQ2FTMTJ3dVBKYmxGQklfRW1OcGxtOTg1RzI4eHEzV2V6NFdzbDNOUnRrTGJQX1VhRl9hMWZieEt4YmcySE8tZWY4R196TDE4UzdVYWxHdy1KdzFlSXFEWndYVE9rM05lYWQ0TW1UNFV5WnpSQXdkdjJ2dUJ0dm9ZSDBVNXQ0Q2Q0VEJiWEhNODctYkZyM2VudzJ2emdNQ0FSUDh4U1dJYm5yVkZSOXJ2X0JNUjJscEpBQW5tWEdHNl_SAYICQVVfeXFMTTRUVWZuNVpKNnJCckpXZkx3VjNYVGRBRVlKakp2QWlLdTZ1TEp3YVh1bUlTcTVidVpONlBOYWlrUzZzb3dKeEdFZ1FwUUs0VjJMS1ZPVGlCR1pOYm9jT2FGakhickFGeU9vLUVRYzBYTmx4ZXAxdEwyTDBJdHlTSGhZR3lRVXVZOEhYYUdmRGtCTDhnbmxLdkRfRTNaZGk2QUpCQmxUZ3NCQ0hxZ2Z0Q2VVTzh1eGpoVDFlN3hSQW1NQjZrWUJ5UWVKN2hJQnVPQ2lRWWduWUwzSUg4aWZVVFNVaWR2YXhGM0ZCYWc3bnl5TXZvX2J4RGpqN29tckR4cHNR</guid></item><item><title>8 daily exercises to reduce cholesterol levels naturally and detox our body - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi_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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise plays a vital role in managing cholesterol by increasing HDL (good cholesterol) and lowering LDL (bad cholesterol) and triglycerides. Regular physical activity, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming, helps improve heart health by promoting better blood circulation and reducing plaque buildup in arteries. Strength training also contributes to overall metabolic health. Exercise aids in weight management, reducing the risk of obesity-related high cholesterol. It enhances insulin sensitivity, lowering the risk of diabetes, which is linked to cholesterol imbalance. For optimal benefits, aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of intense exercise weekly.(Images: Canva)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 06:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_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</guid></item><item><title>Beyond Weight Loss: Semaglutide Could Curb Alcohol Cravings According to USC Study - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNTEgzUkJQNkFGU1dkMmlDZ3dubEI5bWxxT1ZMZXRqRS00MEZOWWJLUVR2cWFRT0hyQ2pBZ1ZUa2pGXzNjXzA4dTV1a05VblpwUVlmVEd2dDhaR0txb3pJZDVPemFONE4tNG04M2RiSHhCcXJlNnQ0aVl5YnNtcmxWRXpFQTFhTWxtbEdRajFLMzh0X3V0NkRrRHhHNnM1SFJUU1JQaWxEV0ZseUk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 03:02:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNTEgzUkJQNkFGU1dkMmlDZ3dubEI5bWxxT1ZMZXRqRS00MEZOWWJLUVR2cWFRT0hyQ2pBZ1ZUa2pGXzNjXzA4dTV1a05VblpwUVlmVEd2dDhaR0txb3pJZDVPemFONE4tNG04M2RiSHhCcXJlNnQ0aVl5YnNtcmxWRXpFQTFhTWxtbEdRajFLMzh0X3V0NkRrRHhHNnM1SFJUU1JQaWxEV0ZseUk</guid></item><item><title>Eye health, long covid and a stress hormone: The week in Well+Being - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxORzlSdGZTanNybnVDbGVRZThZU0NJdWlhaXY5U1NoU0EtdWFIN05pQnpSVHVBa21UQjNUdEtGR1lfc1EwYlpWZU5GNC12dTVoZ1lPV2JHcC1xQV94S20xLUU2QmY2STJsTXhVWWd1dmUycm5JR1Z6by0zN3FQVUkyaHZFd1U3dEdzR2I4TTJJVEE4QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OP5HZZJNUVBLXNQQPFY7DOWAWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;You are reading our weekly Well+Being newsletter. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/well-being/?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=ART&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sign up here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to get it delivered to your inbox every Thursday.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5NILWTAX5FBRPNG26ZWJFVBC6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Happy Thursday!

The cancer vaccine was personalized for each participant to target specific proteins found in their form of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients also received an &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/medications" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:immunotherapy drug;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;immunotherapy drug&lt;/a&gt; (atezolizumab) and standard-of-care chemotherapy after receiving surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic cancer vaccines like this one, referred to as autogene cevumeran, are meant to treat the cancer instead of preventing it, by training the immune system to "recognize cancer cells as foreign," according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Patients who had an immune response to the vaccine were more likely to have reduced cancer risk by their three-year check-up.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is meant to target early stages of cancer that have not spread, where tumors can be surgically removed, to "help delay or prevent recurrence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balachandran noted that this approach could potentially be applied to other forms of cancer as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For patients with pancreatic cancer, our latest results continue to support the approach of using personalized mRNA vaccines to target neoantigens in each patient’s tumor," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you can do this in pancreatic cancer, theoretically you may be able to develop therapeutic vaccines for other cancer types."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer remains one of the deadliest cancers, as only about 13% of patients are alive five years following diagnosis, according to MSK and the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Common therapies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Common therapies&lt;/a&gt;

It's caused by a mutation to a gene called AIPL1 and there is no established treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It was a shock," Jace's dad Brendan says of his first child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"You never think it's going to happen to you, of course, but there was a lot of comfort and relief to finally find out... because it gave us a way to move forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The family was lucky to hear about an experimental trial being carried out in London - just by chance - when they were at a conference about the eye condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Jace's surgery was quick and "pretty easy", his mum says. He had four tiny scars in his eye where healthy copies of the gene were injected into the retina at the back of the eye through keyhole surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;These copies are contained inside a harmless virus, which goes through the retinal cells and replaces the defective gene. The healthy, working genes then kick start a process which helps the cells at the back of the eye work better and survive longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In the first month following treatment, Brendan noticed Jace squint for the first time on seeing bright sunshine streaming through the windows of their house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;His son's progress has been "pretty amazing", he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Pre-surgery, we could have held up an object near his face and he wouldn't be able to track it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Now he's picking things off the floor, he's hauling out toys, doing things driven by his sight that he wouldn't have done before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;This may not be the last treatment he needs in his life, his parents say, but the improvements so far are helping him to know the world better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"It's really hard to undersell the impact of having a little bit of vision," Brendan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;No other options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a43f/live/65946990-efbc-11ef-8e5c-0d2ce78dcb00.jpg.webp" alt="Moorfields Hospital Jace and his mum DJ having their photo taken in London on a sunny day with blue skies, with Tower Bridge in the background" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 fxQYxK"&gt;Moorfields Hospital&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;Jace came to London with his parents for the experimental gene therapy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Prof James Bainbridge, a retinal surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital, who helped lead the trial, said giving children the chance of sight improvement this early on could make a big difference to their development and ability to interact with people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Sight impairment in young children has a devastating effect on their development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"Treatment in infancy with this new genetic medicine can transform the lives of those most severely affected," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The four children, from the United States, Turkey and Tunisia, were all born with an aggressive form of Leber Congenital Amaurosis, where a genetic fault means the cells at the back of their eyes -  that normally help distinguish light and colour- malfunction and rapidly die out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But scientists at University College London developed the innovative procedure, which involves infusing healthy copies of the gene into the back of the eye. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Unlike traditional scientific trials, families were offered this experimental therapy under a special licence designed for compassionate use, when there are no other options readily available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Children had one eye treated each - a measure taken in case the treatment had any adverse effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;They were aged between one and three when they had the procedure and their vision was then checked at intervals over the next four years, in a variety of ways - including moving down corridors and identifying doors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Given their age, some children found the more formal eye tests challenging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;'Hugely impressive'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;According to Moorfields' doctors, the results of the tests they completed, alongside the parent's reports of their improvements, give "compelling evidence" that all four benefited from the treatment and were seeing more than would be expected with the normal course of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Vision in their untreated eyes, meanwhile, deteriorated, as expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Consultant eye surgeon, Prof Michel Michaelides, at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, added: "The outcomes for these children are hugely impressive and show the power of gene therapy to change lives." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The team plans to monitor the children to see how long-lasting the results are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The results so far give them hope that intervening early in other childhood genetic eye conditions could offer the "greatest benefit" and ultimately transform children's lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 02:19:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9WZElYeVFfdkk2aUtCMmV3RDRGNUxuVGhDWlZGVVdXV1pTTk5XS1gyNlExdi1zOGhOTWduUWFmdTNiRlRBbmJHaVB6ZXB1dHVLTnd2NTZHczV1UdIBX0FVX3lxTE10RHZ1em1aTGxVLWV4M2x1dFdPTG5VXzIxcFdCSzBoeWVtdHlya04zWTlnTDdnTWhSVzFvM1N0RWY4UC0yeTVYblJOZklyQW5LXzF5dUxtQ3ZrcVIwcmU4</guid></item><item><title>Sweet Little Aussie Mix Gets Whacked with Brother’s ‘Helicopter Tail’ and Loves Every Second -

When you're that little, everything your sibling does seems so awesome!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On Tuesday, February 18th, one sweet little Australian Shepherd mix puppy was enjoying some coach time with his older brother when he started getting the "helicopter tail" treatment. Honestly, he deserves some credit for his patience:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thetakpak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Tak Pak;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Tak Pak&lt;/a&gt; is 6 rescue dogs and 2 rescue cats strong, plus they're always fostering other pups! The little Aussie/Pit cross in this video is one of those fosters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The puppy came to his foster home with four of his siblings, and they were all suffering from Parvovirus when they got there. As it happens, though, they were ready for their forever homes just a few days before Valentine's Day! All five pups are named after different chocolates:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though we're not sure exactly which pup is in this video, based on another video introducing them all a few days before this one, it looks like Snickers! As you can see, he's super chill with other dogs and doesn't mind a helicopter tail or two; if you've got easily-excited dogs, he could be right for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you'd like to adopt any of the chocolate pups, including him, you can do so from &lt;a href="http://www.coldnosewarmheart.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cold Noses Warm Heart Rescue;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cold Noses Warm Heart Rescue&lt;/a&gt; in New Jersey!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Dogs Can Live Happy Lives After Parvo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All five of the Chocolate pups struggled with Parvovirus when they first got to their foster home, and with consistent treatment and lots of love, all five of them managed to beat the illness!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Parvovirus is a &lt;a href="https://hartforanimals.org/pet-health-blog/2a6egbxl82yddlm-3hzfr-k4lcl-3mzd7-zn452" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:very scary thing;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;very scary thing; &lt;/a&gt;it's one of the first things puppies get vaccinated for when they're born. Parvovirus keeps a dog from being able to properly absorb nutrients; the virus attacks white blood cells and the gastrointestinal tract.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MICHIGAN, USA — Two cats that belonged to Michigan dairy workers died after &lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/bird-avian-flu-cdc-detected-cases-veterinarians-cattle/507-26a6f9ab-3183-4950-81e1-064fd699f09b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cats-dogs-bird-flu-pets-raw-food-7a57b3047164676a7d237bcd05a5b9db" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;being infected&lt;/a&gt; with bird flu. But it's still not clear how the animals got sick or whether they spread the virus to people in the household, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7405a2.htm?s_cid=mm7405a2_w"&gt;a new study shows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veterinary experts said the report, published Thursday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, lacks detail that could confirm whether people can spread the virus to domestic cats — or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don't think there is any way of concluding that there was human-to-cat transmission based on the data that is presented,” said Dr. Diego Diel of the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cats in two separate households died in May after developing severe illnesses that were confirmed as the Type A H5N1 bird virus found in U.S. dairy herds, investigators reported. Both were indoor-only cats that had no exposure to infected cattle or birds and didn't consume raw milk.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One cat that died belonged to a worker on a dairy farm in a county known to have bird flu-infected cattle. The worker reported symptoms of illness before the cat got sick. That cat fell ill, tested positive for H5N1 and had to be euthanized. A second cat in that household also got sick, but it recovered. A third cat in the household didn't get sick and tested negative.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, an adolescent in the household got sick but tested negative for flu.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other cat that died lived in a different household. That pet belonged to a dairy worker who transported raw milk and reported frequent splashes of milk on the face, eyes and clothing. That worker reported eye irritation, a possible symptom of bird flu, two days before the cat got sick.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cat was known to roll in the worker's dirty clothing and died within a day of developing signs of infection, the study authors wrote. Another cat in that household tested negative for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both instances, the dairy workers declined to be tested for H5N1, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means it's impossible to know whether they directly transmitted the virus to their cats, said Dr. Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. It's more likely that the cats were infected by virus on the workers' clothing, boots or hands, he said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that people at this point are not shedding large amounts of virus,” he said. “I don't think it's because this person coughed on their cat.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study concluded that reports of bird flu infections in indoor cats are rare, but “such cats might pose a risk for human infection.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the months since the cats died, there have been several reports of domestic cats becoming infected and dying after &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/raw-milk-california-cats-bird-flu-c3f6201216efb2a7e98ca143329a631a"&gt;consuming unpasteurized milk&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-cats-raw-pet-food-10e7b3bcaffe92ab84cadcbcab1f09c6"&gt;pet food&lt;/a&gt; contaminated with bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new report underscores the need for more comprehensive testing for H5N1 in all arenas, Poulsen said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

It is up to 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine, and can be deadly even in small doses, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She said the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.dea.gov/press-releases/2024/11/15/deas-third-annual-national-family-summit-fentanyl-highlights-progress" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency announced last year&lt;/a&gt; that the potency of fentanyl pills agents have been seizing was decreasing, which may be contributing to the decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"As the drug supply has become more saturated with fentanyl, good drug supply may be becoming more stable, and people may be just developing a tolerance for fentanyl," Cerdá said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report found that West Virginia was the state with the highest rate at 81.9 deaths per 100,000 while Nebraska had the lowest rate at 9.0 deaths per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, between 2022 and 2023, rates of drug overdose deaths decreased in 20 states and did not change significantly in 25 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, over that same period, increases were seen in six states: Alabama, Alaska, California, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Cerdá said one hypothesis is that the increase in overdose death rates in western states may be due to shifts in the drug market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We saw that the penetration of fentanyl really started in the East Coast," she said. "Over time, we saw a shift in the drug supply where fentanyl actually has started to enter the western drug markets … we also see a recent increase in counterfeit pills containing fentanyl, which has also infiltrated the drug market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Nationwide, the overdose death rate from any opioid decreased from 25 deaths per 100,000 in 2022 to 24 deaths per 100,000 deaths in 2023. The death rate from synthetic opioids other than methadone -- which includes fentanyl -- fell as well from 22.7 deaths to 22.2 deaths per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, the overdose death rate for psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine, increased from 10.4 deaths per 100,000 in 2022 to 10.6 deaths in 2023. The death rate for cocaine also increased from 8.2 deaths per 100,000 to 8.6 over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"We should celebrate the decline in overdose deaths, particularly in some of those areas which have historically been most hard hit by this epidemic," Cerdá said. "And we should invest resources and trying to figure out why the decrease is happening, and how can we learn, particularly from those states that are experiencing this decrease to proactively respond to those states which are currently experiencing an increase."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 01:19:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNT0FLem1VQkk1MW5YWTBMMzdDc3hmOXQ4WXZFOFdCU0VCNjdncm1WalFFcDFnTW1jTE5BeGI3WUUtandfS1E4VWVwTE5qRnZvNHEtczF4dlVWazI2elF3QlYtVEYyU2VXMmVnRG9idUMtbF9tbm1vZXBHWHR3eFJ6b0pzcVB0LXZHNTJ6S2g4ckZkSnhybWYwdjZRZ0J2d9IBowFBVV95cUxQYTNOLUpkTGhCVWlNNnhuZHc5eFZmYU5IaXdnNkd0blVNcGpDa001WEN1TFpveWs4U2hhVFR0UjhwMTV5UC1DbmszNUtwOFZUcWJPQ2JjaVhldTBFY2tFYkFNUGJaWVN0YkNfZVZ4UEU2X3djUjF4cTBURjh0bFd6cGNRdGI2X2pYN2JqaWVuRUMtYWJ5UE5OdXVtYlJmTjE0QUhN</guid></item><item><title>Nine-year-old girl from Alden fighting for her life after testing positive for the flu - WKBW 7 News Buffalo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxQOG13TngwbC1kbWEyRlVCMExNd1p1VTJFeXczZGZvcXU4TW1pWGtpVXVESG1IalkzVGZTS3I3LVJPZzJISHJfVnJTem5jRGx3RFc4NlpEMjJIWDc0d1U0SzJ1SHQwVHBDVDlseWNiOVRFbVpzT1hab1R5ZHhXaW9HZzY4WHFpLTJzS1d0SXRBTW9fR0ZieWxxTWxnMUxwYV95WWtydnZiX1ZtR05rMXRZeVdhaFkxUUkzcHhXd3dSVUo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALDEN, N.Y. (WKBW) — Nine-year-old Mia Klyczek is fighting for her life at Oishei Children's Hospital after testing positive for flu B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klyczek went to the ER during the early morning hours of February 19, after a slight fever and vomiting. According to a &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/miracles-for-mia-klyczek" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; set up for Mia, the nine-year-old had a seizure and was sedated with a breathing tube. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her family said doctors believe flu B has caused severe swelling and bleeding in the brain, along with heart issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family is asking for prayers for their girl, hoping for a miracle. On Thursday morning Mia's mother Christina wrote the following on Facebook:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"We were told by the neurologists this morning that the swelling in her brain is severe.

The findings could lead to better therapies for those affected by aging, cancer, and muscular dystrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this research is an enzyme called GCN5, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural proteins of skeletal muscles. These muscles control essential functions such as breathing, posture, and movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a href="https://rupress.org/jcb/article/221/2/e202104022/212962/GCN5-maintains-muscle-integrity-by-acetylating-YY1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt;, highlights how losing GCN5 weakens muscle resilience under physical stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Keir Menzies, a molecular biologist at uOttawa and the study’s senior author, emphasized the enzyme’s importance. “We found that if you delete GCN5 expression from muscle, it will no longer be able to handle extreme physical stress,” he explained. His team spent five years unraveling the enzyme’s impact on muscle health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, researchers created genetically modified mice that lacked GCN5 in their muscles. This allowed them to observe how the enzyme affects cellular processes like &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-class-of-drugs-target-brain-metabolism-to-treat-alzheimers-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt; and inflammation. Without it, the muscles showed a steep decline in function, particularly under physical strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The structure of striated, or skeletal, muscle.

This type of movement typically causes tiny muscle tears, which trigger growth and repair. But without GCN5, the muscles failed to recover, instead breaking down in a way that mimicked the effects of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wild-type mice, which retained normal GCN5 levels, handled the same exercise without issue. Their muscles adapted and repaired as expected. The stark contrast between the two groups underscored GCN5’s essential role in muscle resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Menzies, these findings reflect what is seen in advanced aging and diseases like muscular dystrophy, where muscles progressively weaken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was further supported by human data, which showed a negative correlation between &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-approach-for-boosting-muscle-growth-during-workouts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle fiber diameter&lt;/a&gt; and a multifunctional protein called Yin Yang 1. This protein, which plays a role in various cellular functions, was identified as a target of GCN5 in previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most significant takeaway from the study was that GCN5 is responsible for promoting the production of key muscle proteins, particularly dystrophin. Dystrophin is the primary protein that maintains the integrity of muscle cells by acting as an anchor and shock absorber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4767260/#:~:text=Dystrophin%20is%20a%20rod%20shape,two%20subunits%2C%20%CE%B1%20and%20%CE%B2." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dystrophin&lt;/a&gt;, muscles become highly vulnerable to damage, leading to severe health consequences. Dr. Menzies emphasized, “Our publication shows that if you knock out GCN5, the one major thing we see is a lack of dystrophin, without seeing any real disruption of any other mechanisms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also confirmed that removing GCN5 doesn’t affect the mitochondria—the part of the cell responsible for producing energy—indicating that GCN5’s role in muscle health is more structural than metabolic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings build upon previous research demonstrating the importance of dystrophin in maintaining &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/just-3-seconds-of-daily-exercise-can-significantly-improve-muscle-strength-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle health and integrity&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Menzies suggests that understanding GCN5’s function could help in the development of therapies for muscle degeneration in diseases like muscular dystrophy, as well as conditions related to aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Dystrophin acts as a shock absorber within the muscle cells, reducing any damage caused by muscle contractions.

When these nerves are damaged, they can’t trigger the muscle contractions that are needed to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/surprising-muscle-significantly-increases-metabolism-and-burns-fat-while-sitting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stimulate muscle activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When your muscles don’t contract, your body thinks you don’t need them anymore.

&lt;p&gt;PeaceHealth’s emergency department in Bellingham was overwhelmed by patients this week, forcing hours-long waits and the hospital to cancel some elective procedures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Close to 50 patients were waiting in the emergency room lobby on Tuesday, Feb. 18, with some patients waiting up to eight hours in the lobby before being seen and treated in the emergency department, according to a PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center employee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It “was a record for total number of patients in the department and total in the lobby waiting,” stated an internal hospital message sent on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At one point, there were more than 100 patients either in the emergency department lobby or being treated, according to the source, an emergency department employee who was granted confidentiality by Cascadia Daily News due to fear of retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We had a patient in their 90s wait seven hours,” the employee said. “We had patients with chest pain waiting for hours to be seen, and patients in a crowded environment positive with the flu. It wasn’t a good situation at all.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PeaceHealth was not immediately able to verify numbers provided to CDN, but did confirm that the hospital was “routinely seeing much higher daily” emergency department numbers than usual in February.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The facility reported “unprecedented patient volumes” in the department due to rising cases of RSV, flu and other emergent health needs, according to a Feb. 19 news release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hospital urged those with non-emergency health issues to seek medical care elsewhere. These options include primary care providers, urgent care clinics and PeaceHealth’s priority care clinics, which offer same-day, drop-in care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Please know that we treat everyone who visits our Emergency Department, but those with non-emergency needs will most likely have a longer wait time before we are able to care for them,” said Dr. James Scribner, medical director at PeaceHealth St. Joseph’s Emergency Department.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Some elective procedures at the hospital were canceled Wednesday morning. A voicemail left with a patient and shared with CDN stated that “the hospital is full to capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The patient, Rebecca Youlin, was told to contact her surgeon’s office to reschedule a biopsy procedure she started planning in November. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Youlin was able to reschedule for early March. But, she noted that if the biopsy eventually revealed any concerns, such as cancerous cells, she would be two weeks farther behind fighting it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While scheduled to be a patient on Wednesday, Youlin is also an ICU nurse at PeaceHealth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This whole week has been insane,” she said, noting that she was concerned that the hospital was at capacity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[Being at capacity] basically means that if you are sick enough to need a bed in the hospital, you may end up being boarded in the ER until a bed becomes available,” said Youlin, who has been a registered nurse for 15 years. “Believe me, when you are sick enough to be admitted, the ER is the least conducive environment to healing!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The confidential source at PeaceHealth told CDN that it has become common for part of the hospital’s emergency department to be partially filled with these “boarders” — patients who have been admitted but are awaiting a bed on a different floor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Youlin recognized that the nation is facing a &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/worst-flu-season-influenza-virus-spread-new-bird-flu-cases-us-plus"&gt;particularly bad flu season&lt;/a&gt;, she said the community has outgrown the medical facility. This is, in some ways, illustrated by how often a “code white” is declared at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A code white from the emergency room is essentially letting staff know they need to get all the patients that have admission orders to their rooms to make space for new patients, Youlin explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These code whites are being called on a daily basis, she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everyone is “inundated and slammed,” Youlin said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PeaceHealth did not respond to a question about the number of code whites called at the facility so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “We are asking the community to consider other care options for non-emergency healthcare needs so our team can care for the most ill and vulnerable,” Dr. Scribner stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Scribner encouraged anyone with difficulty breathing to come to the ER for an evaluation. He added that for other flu or respiratory virus symptoms, like body aches and coughing, self-care or a visit to a primary care physician or same-day clinic may be a more suitable option.&lt;/p&gt;

It was not expected. He was a very healthy middle aged male harbor seal," said Rapoza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said he is one of three animals there have died from Avian flu in the past four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had a bird that tested positive, and we had a wild black vulture that tested positive" said Rapoza. "But Blue was the first mammal that tested positive here on site."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said Blue's death has been hard for the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born at the zoo 21 years ago, an animal ambassador that educated people about seals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue  started on Feb. 1, when one of his keepers noticed he wasn't eating, which wasn't unusual, but noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The next day he was showing some symptoms that seemed to be GI related, or stomach related," said Rapoza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blue was treated and monitored, but he wasn't getting better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The next step was potentially going to be a Cat scan," said Rapoza. "Unfortunately, on the morning of the fifth, which was the fifth day, the keeper came in to find that he had passed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was an initial swab testing for Blue that came back negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recommendation from the Lincoln Park Zoo, which also recently lost a harbor seal to the Avian flu, resulted in a positive test from the National Vet Services Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luna and Conway, two female harbor seals, shared the habitat with Blue. They were separated from him as soon as he started to show symptoms. Rapoza said the zoo is constantly monitoring the girls' health, and doing everything they can to mitigate further risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harbor seal habitat is an open enclosure, but Rapoza said birds rarely enter the space, so it is not clear how Blue came in contact with a wild bird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buttonwood Park Zoo and Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence told NBC 10 they are ramping up biosecurity measures to combat the Avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measures include more footbaths at exhibits, and personal protective equipment for zookeepers, removing duck feeders, disinfecting and more actions to avoid cross contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harbor seal exhibit zookeeper Amanda Jacobson showed NBC 10 the mixture used for the footbaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have different areas that are different risk levels,  and just by doing this anywhere we can, it will minimize that risk," said Jacobson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kim Wojick with Roger Williams Park Zoo acknowledged that Avian flu concerns are only getting worse, but there are things everyone can do to prevent the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It used to be something that we thought about, but didn't have to deal with," said Wojick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that it's here and it's widespread, we're now living in that reality where when we potentially make new exhibits, we're going to be looking at ways we can design those exhibits to keep our animals as safe as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roger Williams Park Zoo moved animals like its eagles from their open habitat to an enclosed space for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buttonwood is testing all of its birds, monitoring the health of all of its animals, and educating the public on how to avoid spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've weathered the storm through West Nile, Triple E, COVID," said Rapoza. "Our guests do not have direct contact with our animals and so there is no risk to them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapoza reminds that people not to feed wild birds, keep pets away from dead birds, and call animal control or DEM to assist with birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The risk has been lower to humans but there still have been human cases so don't touch anything without personal protective equipment," said Rapoza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capron Park Zoo in Attleboro said it is monitoring for bird flu and will report suspicious bird deaths to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, keepers say they are not doing anything out of the ordinary, because they don’t have many waterfowl in their zoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Turn to 10</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 00:04:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Drug overdose deaths fall in 2023 for 1st time since pandemic began: CDC - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNT0FLem1VQkk1MW5YWTBMMzdDc3hmOXQ4WXZFOFdCU0VCNjdncm1WalFFcDFnTW1jTE5BeGI3WUUtandfS1E4VWVwTE5qRnZvNHEtczF4dlVWazI2elF3QlYtVEYyU2VXMmVnRG9idUMtbF9tbm1vZXBHWHR3eFJ6b0pzcVB0LXZHNTJ6S2g4ckZkSnhybWYwdjZRZ0J2dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Rates of drug overdose deaths decreased in the United States for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began, according to new federal data published early Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The rate of overdose deaths fell from 32.6 deaths per 100,000 people in 2022 to 31.3 per 100,000 people in 2023, a 4% decrease, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/drug-overdose/drug-overdose-2022-2023.htm#table" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Aitzaz Munir, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and associate program director for the Rutgers Addiction Medicine Fellowship Program, told ABC News the drop in the overdose death rate was "surprising" to him but a positive sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He said he believes the decrease in deaths may be due to a more "aggressive approach" toward the treatment of drug conditions including more treatment programs and making them more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This includes making &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/overdose-reversal-drug-narcan-buy-counter-starting-september/story?id=102671170" target="_blank"&gt;naloxone, an overdose reversal drug, more widely available&lt;/a&gt; and increasing the availability of drug checking supplies, including fentanyl test strips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"So, there might be a better response in places where these treatments are available and patients are getting those treatments," he said.

"Over time, we saw a shift in the drug supply where fentanyl actually has started to enter the western drug markets … we also see a recent increase in counterfeit pills containing fentanyl, which has also infiltrated the drug market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Nationwide, the overdose death rate from any opioid decreased from 25 deaths per 100,000 in 2022 to 24 deaths per 100,000 deaths in 2023. The death rate from synthetic opioids other than methadone -- which includes fentanyl -- fell as well from 22.7 deaths to 22.2 deaths per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, the overdose death rate for psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine, increased from 10.4 deaths per 100,000 in 2022 to 10.6 deaths in 2023. The death rate for cocaine also increased from 8.2 deaths per 100,000 to 8.6 over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"We should celebrate the decline in overdose deaths, particularly in some of those areas which have historically been most hard hit by this epidemic," Cerdá said.

The cat was brought to a local vet and then the Michigan State University (MSU) Veterinary Medical Center, which has advanced treatments available. But due to "rapid disease progression," the cat was euthanized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bird flu had &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/h5n1-bird-flu-has-spread-to-human-from-cow-in-2nd-probable-case-cdc-reports" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/h5n1-bird-flu-has-spread-to-human-from-cow-in-2nd-probable-case-cdc-reports"&gt;&lt;u&gt;been reported on some Michigan dairy farms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by that time, and the cat's owner worked on a dairy farm, although not directly with the animals. The sick cat's body was submitted for further testing after euthanization, and swabs from the cat's brain and nose came back positive for H5N1. The virus samples from the cat matched the viruses circulating in local cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hPVA8FkageHKRqGakGAQ4Y" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hPVA8FkageHKRqGakGAQ4Y slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery prompted a broader investigation, in which officials found that another indoor cat in the household developed potential bird flu symptoms after the first cat did. These symptoms included decreased appetite and watery eye discharge, but the cat ultimately recovered without specific treatment. No specimens from the second cat were tested for H5N1, but the timing of illness may point to possible transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the dairy worker declined to be tested for bird flu, they did report experiencing vomiting and diarrhea a day before the first cat got sick. The three other members of the worker's household tested negative for influenza A, the broad group of viruses H5N1 belongs to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating the picture, one person in the household — a teenager who'd had "regular contact" with the sick cat — got sick about six days after the cat did. Their symptoms included cough, sore throat, headache and muscle aches. However, the teen tested negative for flu and instead came back positive on a test that looks for other common viruses, such as common-cold viruses. So while the timing of the teen's infection could be worrisome, based on these test results, it may be that the individual had a run-of-the-mill respiratory illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the same time frame in a different Michigan household, a second indoor cat came down with bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 6-month-old male, that cat was also an exclusively indoor pet. The owner brought the cat into the MSU clinic after it showed one day of "progressive neurologic deterioration," facial swelling and stopped eating. The cat died within 24 hours of these symptoms emerging. Nasal swabs from the cat were positive for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cat's owner, a dairy worker who transported unpasteurized (raw) milk from various farms, declined testing for bird flu. The worker had a "fear of losing employment as a consequence of communicating with public health officials and implicating farms that provided milk," the MMWR notes. However, the worker did report having notable eye irritation two days before the cat got sick. (Recent H5N1 infections in humans have &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/h5n1-bird-flu-has-spread-to-human-from-cow-in-2nd-probable-case-cdc-reports" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/flu/h5n1-bird-flu-has-spread-to-human-from-cow-in-2nd-probable-case-cdc-reports"&gt;&lt;u&gt;often involved eye symptoms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, namely conjunctivitis.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worker also reported having not worn protective equipment when handling raw milk and frequently experiencing "splash exposures" to the face, eyes and clothing while working. The cat that got infected and died frequently rolled in the owner's clothes, whereas a second cat in the household that didn't get sick did not exhibit that behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because neither dairy worker received testing for A(H5), whether cat 1A's owner's gastrointestinal symptoms or cat 2A's owner's ocular symptoms were because of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection or a different etiology [cause] is unknown," the MMWR says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, a data table included in the new MMWR was actually published earlier in the month, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/health/cdc-bird-flu-cats-people.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/health/cdc-bird-flu-cats-people.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The New York Times reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Feb. 6. This seems to have been accidental, as the table was promptly taken down. (Live Science has asked the CDC to confirm whether this data table is the same one that was taken down, but based on that previous news story, the data appears the same.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Times report, in early February, the data table had briefly appeared in a report that otherwise focused on air quality and the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/weather/wildfires-raging-in-la-are-being-fueled-by-santa-ana-winds-what-are-they" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/weather/wildfires-raging-in-la-are-being-fueled-by-santa-ana-winds-what-are-they"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Los Angeles County wildfires&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Times reported. Prior to the wildfire report's release, a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-health-agencies-communication-allowed-still-blocked-rcna190527" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-health-agencies-communication-allowed-still-blocked-rcna190527" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pause had been placed on external communications from federal health agencies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including the CDC's MMWR, which had been published every week for decades. At the time, experts expressed concern that the data were potentially being withheld for political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-hPVA8FkageHKRqGakGAQ4Y-Cjss3gj579YRvtxSx1rw9dH0PcJsRDqo" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-hPVA8FkageHKRqGakGAQ4Y-Cjss3gj579YRvtxSx1rw9dH0PcJsRDqo slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical or veterinary advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four young children have gained life-changing improvements in sight following treatment with a pioneering new genetic medicine through UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital, with the support of MeiraGTx.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The children were born with a severe impairment to their sight due to a rare genetic deficiency that affects the AIPL1 gene. The condition, a form of retinal dystrophy, means those affected are born with only sufficient sight to distinguish between light and darkness. The gene defect causes the retinal cells to malfunction and die, with children affected being legally certified as blind from birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new treatment is designed to enable the retinal cells to work better and to survive longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure, developed by UCL scientists, consists of injecting healthy copies of the gene into the retina at the back of the eye through keyhole surgery. These copies are contained inside a harmless virus, so they can penetrate the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/retinal+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;retinal cells&lt;/a&gt; and replace the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/defective+gene/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;defective gene&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition is very rare, and the first children identified were from overseas. To mitigate any potential safety issues, the first four children received this novel therapy in one eye only. All four saw remarkable improvements in the treated eye over the following three to four years, but lost sight in their untreated eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcomes of the new treatment, reported in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet&lt;/i&gt;, show that gene therapy at an early age can dramatically improve &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sight/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sight&lt;/a&gt; for children with this condition—one that is rare and particularly severe. Successful gene therapy for another form of genetic blindness (RPE65 deficiency) has been available on the NHS since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;These new findings offer hope that children affected by both rare and more common forms of genetic blindness may in time also benefit from genetic medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is now exploring the means to make this new treatment more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor James Bainbridge, professor of retinal studies at UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and consultant retinal surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital, said, "Sight impairment in young children has a devastating effect on their development. Treatment in infancy with this new genetic medicine can transform the lives of those most severely affected."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Michel Michaelides, professor of ophthalmology at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and consultant retinal specialist at Moorfields Eye Hospital, commented, "We have, for the first time, an effective treatment for the most severe form of childhood blindness, and a potential paradigm shift to treatment at the earliest stages of the disease. The outcomes for these children are hugely impressive and show the power of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gene+therapy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; to change lives."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure to administer the treatment to the affected children took place at Great Ormond Street Hospital. The children were assessed in the NIHR Moorfields Clinical Research Facility, and the NIHR Moorfields Biomedical Research Center provided infrastructure for the research.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIVERSIDE, Calif. — Four black rats in Riverside County tested positive for Bird Flu. It is the first time the H5N1 virus has been found in rats.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture &lt;/a&gt;(USDA), health officials found the four rats over the course of three days, from January 29, 2025, through January 31.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the USDA found the virus spreading to other animals, including domestic cats. In January, two house cats in the Bay Area tested positive for Bird Flu, and two tested positive in Los Angeles. Health officials in Oregon and Montana also found the virus had spread to domestic cats last month.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the data, the virus has also spread to marine life.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 5, a harbor seal in Bristol, Massachusetts, tested positive for bird flu, and two bottlenose dolphins in Florida were also found to, also found to be infected. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wild birds typically spread bird flu, and it is highly contagious, most often fatal in birds. In recent years, the virus has infected mammals as well as humans. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From March 2024 through December 2024, health officials have confirmed 61 cases of bird flu in humans, 34 of which were in California. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus has also had a major impact on poultry farms and has resulted in an increase in the price of eggs.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since the outbreak began in 2022, the bird flu outbreak has prompted the slaughter of roughly 160 million birds to help control the virus. This has driven egg prices up to a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/egg-prices-record-bird-flu-a2394bdefc7bd0514d4f003cc5e8a908" target="_blank"&gt;record high&lt;/a&gt; of $4.95 per dozen on average. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

Essentially, kidney stones are hard deposits made up of minerals and salts that form in your kidneys. If you’ve never had one, count your blessings. If you have, then you already know you'd do just about anything to avoid another visit from these sinister stones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Now, while there’s no magic spell to guarantee you’ll be kidney-stone-free for life, there are a few lifestyle changes and dietary tweaks that might tip the odds in your favor. Enter the latest research finding: data published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports &lt;/em&gt;suggests that increasing niacin intake might help reduce the risk of developing kidney stones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This article will take a closer look at the details of this new research and explore what it means for you. By understanding these findings, you’ll gain insight into how you may have one more tool in the arsenal against those pebble-sized pains in the back.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kidney stones are a common issue, affecting around 11% of certain populations in the United States.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is an important nutrient that the body needs to function properly. However, while niacin plays many crucial roles in the body, it is unclear if this nutrient impacts kidney stone risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study looked at data from a large health survey called the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) that took place from 2007 to 2018. Researchers evaluated what people ate over a 24-hour period to learn how much niacin they were consuming. They also asked participants if they had a history of kidney stones through a questionnaire.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To study the potential link between niacin intake and kidney stones, they used advanced statistical methods to analyze the data. The study included a total of 28,508 participants, making it a thorough investigation into whether niacin in your diet might affect kidney stone risk. The average age of the participants was a little over 47 years old. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After analyzing the data, researchers found that people who experience kidney stones often share certain characteristics. They are more likely to be men, older, white, have higher household incomes, smoke, exercise more and have a history of conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes. Interestingly, they also tend to consume less niacin through their diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When comparing those who ate the least niacin with those who ate the most, the latter group had about 22% lower chances of getting kidney stones. This benefit was particularly noticeable in people under the age of 60. Scientists also observed that the connection between niacin and kidney stone risk wasn't entirely straightforward—it followed an "L-shaped" pattern, showing that even a modest increase in niacin intake seemed to help reduce the risk. These findings suggest that including more niacin-rich foods in your diet may make a difference in kidney stone risk reduction, especially for younger adults.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The author of this study suggests that while the reason why niacin may impact kidney stones remains unclear, one possible reason is because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Kidney stones often form from calcium crystals in a process that involves inflammation and oxidative stress, a condition where potentially harmful molecules, known as reactive oxygen species, may damage cells. Niacin has antioxidant properties that help fight these effects. Niacin may also support the health of mitochondria, the energy producers in cells, which may help prevent crystal buildup in the kidneys. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are a few important limits to consider in the study. First, since it was cross-sectional, it means we can't say for sure that eating more or less niacin is what causes changes in kidney stone risk. Cross-sectional studies capture data at a single point in time, making it difficult to establish cause-and-effect relationships.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Second, the researchers relied on participants to report their dietary habits and kidney stone history through questionnaires, so there's always a chance that some details were misremembered. Also, certain specifics, like the exact makeup of the kidney stones, weren't included in the database used. Lastly, eating habits can change over time, and since dietary information was recorded from 24-hour recalls, it might not represent long-term patterns. Despite these challenges, this study sheds light on how diet might help prevent kidney stones, but future studies are needed to further confirm these findings and understand the role of niacin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply To Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re someone who has experienced kidney stones (or you’d just like to avoid them), the findings of this study offer an intriguing slice of hope. It seems that niacin intake may play a role in reducing your risk of these painful deposits. While it’s not an excuse to go and raid your local supplement aisle just yet, it might be a good time to look at how much niacin you’re getting in your daily diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, it's not quite as simple as just sprinkling niacin over your dinner and declaring yourself invincible. Kidney stones can be caused by many factors—hydration levels, genetics and underlying health conditions can all influence your risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This research doesn't eliminate any of those factors, but it does suggest that niacin might be one part of a bigger puzzle. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, it’s important to approach it with realistic expectations. You don’t need to overhaul your entire diet overnight or start obsessing over niacin levels. Small, thoughtful adjustments, like prioritizing foods rich in this nutrient while keeping up with other healthy habits, may make a meaningful difference over time. After all, when the alternative is potentially passing a kidney stone, any edge you can get is worth considering, right? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are some foods to focus on if you are trying to increase your niacin intake:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other common sources of niacin include brown rice and salmon—so a simple rice bowl like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/crispy-salmon-rice-bowl-8628232" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Crispy Salmon Rice Bowl&lt;/a&gt; is also a great way to add some niacin to your day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And though it seems like a simple solution, we wouldn’t recommend you &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-vitamin-b-complex-8669791" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;take a niacin supplement&lt;/a&gt; without consulting with your healthcare provider. It’s always a good idea to speak with your doctor before adding a supplement to your routine.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the science linking niacin intake to a reduced risk of kidney stones is still evolving, this research in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; holds promise for anyone hoping to steer clear of these notorious nuisances. Incorporating niacin-rich foods into your diet might just be another step toward keeping your kidneys happy and healthy. But remember, no single nutrient is a cure-all. A balanced diet, proper hydration, and an awareness of individual risk factors are all essential pieces of the puzzle. And when it comes to kidney stones, it’s always better to prevent than to pass, right?

Inflammation in her body went down, her appetite was quelled, and she lost five pounds in the first week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three months later her doctor increased her dosage to 1.7mg, standard procedure when the patient is acclimating well and could benefit from a boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Ms Burgess began experiencing debilitating side effects, including &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14304681/ozempic-patient-effects-weight-loss-study-exposes-risk.html"&gt;nausea and severe&lt;/a&gt; stomach pain. She was vomiting and had occasional diarrhea or constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Burgess' goal was to lose 50 lbs with the help of Ozempic. Since starting it in 2023, she has lost 60lbs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I realized this is not okay. This is not how I wanted to lose weight,’ she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That’s when she and her doctor discussed microdosing the drug - or taking less than the 0.25 mg starter dose, which she had tolerated with no side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, Ms Burgess has lost 60 lbs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s not clear how many people have personalized their treatment to microdose, but for Ms Burgess it was a life-changing hack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dosages of Ozempic and similar drugs, including Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound, are meant to be increased very gradually, roughly every four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Katie Sorensen, a nurse practitioner specializing in GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, who was not involved in Burgess’ treatment, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://parade.com/health/i-tried-microdosing-on-ozempic"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt;: ‘The microdosing strategy has some attractive benefits, including helping to mitigate side effects and being able to customize the dose to the minimum efficacious dose for individual patients.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The microdosing regimen has not been approved by the FDA, in part because ‘we would not be able to say for certain that a patient is reaping the full potential benefits of GLP-1 medications that have been shown in recent clinical trials,’ according to Ms Sorensen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If individuals experience weight loss with small doses, it could be because they are what scientists refer to as ‘super responders.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This term describes a specific group of people who achieve significant weight loss rapidly when taking these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While studies have shown most people need to remain on semaglutide or a similar drug indefinitely in order to keep the weight off, it's not clear if those rules apply to a microdose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But research into the drug's long-term effects is beginning to suggest that, regardless of dosage, a person must keep taking it because, while it suppresses appetite, it doesn't permanently alter the metabolism.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Madison did not disclose the dosage she is currently taking, but she has not experienced any adverse side effects in the two years she’s been microdosing Ozempic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her appetite is back, but the food noise has abated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘I’m a big advocate now of microdosing. Going slow and staying low is my motto nowadays and I think it’s better for long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s been absolutely great.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Burgess began microdosing Ozempic when a higher dose made her sick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A UK study found that people who used Wegovy experienced rapid weight loss, dropping 18% of their weight over 68 weeks. They regained two-thirds of that weight, or 12 percent of their original body weight in the year after dropping the weekly shots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seeing those first five pounds melt away motivated Ms Burgess to get the most out of her medication. Determined not to let her weight loss stall after lowering her dose, she also prioritized eating more fiber and protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘You can’t think you can get on a GLP-1 medication and it’s going to completely change everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s just a tool. You need to create sustainable healthy habits to progress in the long run, especially if you eventually get off it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many who stop taking the medications do regain some or all of the weight they lost and some people end up weighing more.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study last autumn found a majority of people who stopped taking semaglutide - the active ingredient in Ozempic - regained about two-thirds of the weight loss and had worsening health markers, including higher blood pressure and cholesterol and increased risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Approximately 12 percent of US adults report having ever used Ozempic or another similar medication for weight loss, while six percent indicated they were currently using the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 85 percent of people who had recently started medications like Ozempic discontinued use within two years, and 71 percent stopped within the first year, either because they had reached their goal weight or because the drugs were too expensive - with a price tag of approximately $1,000 monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shots have also been shown to raise the risk of life-altering and even deadly effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have raised concerns about popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic potentially &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14380795/ozempic-patients-blind-doctors-effect.html"&gt;leading to blindness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has connected these injections to conditions that trigger inflammation and restrict blood flow to the eye, resulting in severe and sometimes irreversible vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medicines have also been shown to cause stomach paralysis, a condition where the stomach muscles don't function properly, leading to delayed emptying of food into the small intestine, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13813961/Ozempic-triggered-deadly-effect-forced-ORGAN-removed-robbed-basic-human-function.html"&gt;and ischemic colitis&lt;/a&gt;, a condition where reduced blood flow to the colon causes inflammation and injury to the intestinal lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A DailyMail.com investigation last year also revealed that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13816987/deaths-linked-ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-analysis.html"&gt;at least 160 people&lt;/a&gt; have died while taking Ozempic. None of the deaths are proven to have been directly caused by the injections, but experts say the reports indicate cases where they're suspected to have played a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 22:35:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPZVNwbjFzYzAzZGFmUk9aLUJpM25OMk83NXpsZVMyNWllUENLUjk3cGhUNlR4WGdDbXloOF9HcDQyQ2c4OW41cC1aR0J5U1JFNWtsRmdpeFVjc3plY3pNVmVhTmFuX2JicW51SDBOZVk2SkhiUzR4MEh4VlJXNmRMSmVsMVVDdVdGem9WY0xzVlhBbklXMFpPaXBiZVc4Mnh5OGZ4U2NWZWowd9IBrwFBVV95cUxQb2tBNGpRVVluZ0ZVVEJaMTlfZU9naURSYUREbHFJZEZvdmpmOEs1cmprdFI1bERvN1NiSno3RDQwUm1PQ3NFXzdnQzhoNllfTzVCYTd4dWp3aVRUQ1ZzS2g1TFFxc2I4WTNPcnRuTmNCTlZ3THFBNC1HaVF0amNXb29fel9fWVl4MzV6eTRjU1dKUUMxTkJ0Mm1vcVdwZVZqNElrY0RPZnprY0JGeHI4</guid></item><item><title>I tried microdosing Ozempic... what happened shocked even doctors - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPZVNwbjFzYzAzZGFmUk9aLUJpM25OMk83NXpsZVMyNWllUENLUjk3cGhUNlR4WGdDbXloOF9HcDQyQ2c4OW41cC1aR0J5U1JFNWtsRmdpeFVjc3plY3pNVmVhTmFuX2JicW51SDBOZVk2SkhiUzR4MEh4VlJXNmRMSmVsMVVDdVdGem9WY0xzVlhBbklXMFpPaXBiZVc4Mnh5OGZ4U2NWZWowdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Madison Burgess had struggled with her weight for most of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 25-year-old hit roadblocks on the path to her goal of losing 50lbs, including a workout regimen that didn’t seem to be helping and a persistent sweet tooth that had her reaching for desserts more than she’d like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Burgess, a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/michigan/index.html" id="mol-741f30b0-efcd-11ef-ba55-db7ef6af9d79"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers recently reported new evidence from a study of a medical device placed inside the body, a spine-&lt;strong&gt;stimulating&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;implant&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three people with a muscle-destroying disease got a little stronger after using the implant. They were able to stand and walk more easily because of electrical stimulation to their spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marco Capogrosso is an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburg, or Pitt, who led the research. "These people were definitely not expecting an improvement," he said. Capogrosso said, "They were getting better and better," over the study that lasted one month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returning muscle function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implant was able to return some muscle &lt;strong&gt;function&lt;/strong&gt;, at least temporarily. The implant was already being tested to treat &lt;strong&gt;paralysis&lt;/strong&gt; in other patients. This new evidence suggests it might also aid diseases of the nervous system like spinal muscle atrophy, or SMA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMA is a genetic disease that slowly destroys motor &lt;strong&gt;neurons&lt;/strong&gt;, nerve cells in the spinal cord that control muscles. That leads muscles to waste away, especially in the legs, hips, and shoulders and sometimes those involved with breathing and swallowing. There is no cure. A gene therapy can save the lives of very young children with a severe form of the disease, and there are some medicines to slow the disease in older patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulating the spinal cord with low levels of electricity has long been used to treat chronic, or long-term, pain. Capogrosso's team also has tested it to help people paralyzed by &lt;strong&gt;strokes&lt;/strong&gt; or spinal cord injury move their arms and legs with assistance. The system sends electrical signals to nerves that have stopped reacting. This has the effect of activating the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capogrosso wondered if that same technology might help patients with SMA by stimulating sensory nerves to signal damaged muscle cells causing them to move. The researchers at the University of Pittsburgh published their study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They implanted electrodes over the lower spinal cord of the three adults with SMA. Using the device did not return normal movement but with a few hours of spinal stimulation a week, all soon experienced improvements in muscle strength and function, the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"You never get better"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty-seven-year-old Doug McCullough took part in the study. "With a progressive disease you never get any better," he said, adding, “So having any improvement is just a really &lt;strong&gt;surreal&lt;/strong&gt; and very exciting &lt;strong&gt;benefit&lt;/strong&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three subjects increased how far they could walk in six minutes by the study's end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capogrosso said they could walk farther because they got less tired and “even a person this many years into the disease can improve."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found the improvements did not disappear as soon as the stimulator was turned off. But they did decrease a few months after the study ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientist Susan Harkema led similar studies of stimulation for spinal cord injuries while at the University of Louisville. She warned that the new study is small and did not last very long but said it was an important test of the device. She said it should be tested next with other muscle-&lt;strong&gt;degenerating&lt;/strong&gt; diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capogrosso said some small but longer studies are beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capogrosso said they could walk farther because they got less tired and “even a person this many years into the disease can improve."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found the improvements did not disappear as soon as the stimulator was turned off. But they did decrease a few months after the study ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientist Susan Harkema led similar studies of stimulation for spinal cord injuries while at the University of Louisville. She warned that the new study is small and did not last very long but said it was an important test of the device. She said it should be tested next with other muscle-&lt;strong&gt;degenerating&lt;/strong&gt; diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capogrosso said some small but longer studies are beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. wanted advertisements that promote the idea of “informed consent” in vaccine decision-making instead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Informed consent is the principle that people should be notified of all the risks, as well as benefits, of any medical intervention they receive or any drug they are prescribed. It is a cornerstone of health care delivery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shifting the framing of advertising for vaccines that the CDC has long recommended — like flu shots — to more heavily focus on the risks of vaccines could undermine people’s willingness to get vaccinated, or to have their children immunized. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Informed consent is always a must,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. But he suggested generating materials that focus heavily on possible risks without putting them in the context of proven benefits could badly hurt vaccination rates in the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The decision to pull flu shot advertising is an early sign of how RFK Jr. may shift the U.S. approach to vaccinations as the nation’s top health official. Others came Thursday as well: The CDC’s influential vaccine advisory committee &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/acip-cdc-vaccine-meeting-postponed/"&gt;postponed a meeting scheduled for next week&lt;/a&gt;, and Politico reported that RFK Jr. may remove some members of that committee and other influential public health bodies, claiming they have &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;conflicts of interest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;STAT asked HHS whether the CDC had been instructed to cease promotional campaigns for several vaccines, including the Wild to Mild flu vaccine campaign, and whether the HHS secretary wanted replacements that focus on informed consent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an emailed response, an official did not answer the second question, and denied that the CDC had been told to take down its flu vaccination campaign website — which was not the question asked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“No, the CDC was not told to take down the flu vaccination campaign webpage,” said an HHS spokesperson. “Unfortunately, officials inside the CDC who are averse to Secretary Kennedy and President Trump’s agenda seem to be intentionally falsifying and misrepresenting guidance they receive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s own &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;informational pages&lt;/a&gt; on the benefits of flu shots still remain. The materials that sources told STAT they were instructed to take down were for paid promotions on other websites. Versions of those promotions were previously visible on some CDC webpages but are no longer up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Flu vaccination can keep you from getting sick with flu,” one of the remaining pages states. “Flu vaccine prevents millions of illnesses and flu-related doctor’s visits each year.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, uptake rates for a number of vaccines have declined. About 23% of adults have received an updated Covid-19 shot. And though this flu season has been protracted, about 45% of people &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data-research/dashboard/vaccination-trends-adults.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;have received a flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; this season — down about five percentage points from flu shot uptake in the pre-Covid era.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/trump-hhs-secretary-pick-rfk-jr-financial-disclosures-biotech-investments-book-advances/"&gt;generated substantial income &lt;/a&gt;from challenging the safety of vaccines — through paid speeches, books, his former position as founder and chair of Children’s Health Defense, and as a lawyer suing vaccine manufacturers — refused repeatedly during his Senate confirmation hearings to distance himself from disproven claims about the safety of vaccines, such as the claim that &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/03/vaccine-autism-rfk-jr-how-science-proves-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/"&gt;vaccines are behind rising autism rates&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, he said during the hearing that he is not opposed to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though several senators expressed concern about Kennedy’s positions on vaccines, only former Senate leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a survivor of polio, voted against Kennedy’s confirmation on the Republican side of the chamber.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) expressed serious concerns about Kennedy during the hearings on his nomination. Cassidy is a physician who strongly supports vaccination. But in the end he voted for Kennedy after receiving &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/04/rfk-jr-confirmation-vote-analysis-hard-line-on-vaccines-gop-senators-warn-trump-hhs-nominee/"&gt;assurances&lt;/a&gt; that Kennedy would work within the current system and not undermine vaccination efforts in the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The promotional campaigns the CDC was ordered to stop involved modest outlays of money, one source told STAT. They included paid ads in digital publications or promoted posts on social media platforms, the individual said. NPR &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reported earlier&lt;/a&gt; that the “Wild to Mild” campaign was halted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ads featured images of fierce and less threatening animals — one juxtaposed a teddy bear against a grizzly — to convey the message that even if flu vaccines do not always prevent infection, people who receive them are less likely to become seriously ill and to need hospital care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Flu can be wild. But a flu vaccine can shield both you and your cub from flu’s more serious symptoms,” said one of the ads, aimed at pregnant people. “Ask your health care provider about a flu shot during your pregnancy to protect your baby after birth — when they’re too young to be vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other iterations of the campaign were aimed at parents, adults with chronic conditions, people over the age of 65, and health care professionals.&lt;br&gt;In the materials viewable on &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250131145821/https://www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/toolkit/social-media.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a now scrubbed webpage&lt;/a&gt; there was no discussion about risks from flu shots. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are few side effects from flu vaccination, and those that are reported — things like injection site reactions, headaches and fatigue — are short-lived. In some, though not all, years, flu vaccination appears to be linked to a slightly higher risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/guillain-barre.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Guillain-Barré syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a form of progressive and generally temporary paralysis. In the seasons when an increase of GBS has been seen it is at a rate of about one or two additional cases per one million doses of flu vaccine administered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being infected with the flu is known to increase the risk of developing GBS as well. Ensuring that people are aware of the risks of vaccines before receiving them is &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-vaccines-kennedy-confirmation-hearing-vaccination-policy-hhs-secretary/"&gt;one of the six parts of a vaccine safety plan&lt;/a&gt; that RFK Jr. published in 2023. Already, people receive printed information with the risks of vaccines before they or their children are immunized, and advertising for specific vaccines is required to disclose side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — Is your ZIP code more important than your genetic code when it comes to having a long, healthy life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics and lifestyle both contribute to how people age, the diseases they develop and how long they're likely to live. But the role the factors play and how much they influence disease development and premature death might surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socioeconomics and lifestyle have more to do with healthy aging than genetics, according to a big new international study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03483-9" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; that says both lifestyle choices and living conditions are significantly more important than genetics to living a long, healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, of 25 independent exposures associated with premature death, age-related diseases and healthy aging, "We find that the major drivers or premature death and aging in our sample are smoking, socioeconomic status and deprivation, ethnicity, physical activity, living with a partner, sleep and mental and physical wellness including tiredness, as well as early life exposures including health and body size at 10 years and maternal smoking around birth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They note that many factors combine to form the "environmental architecture of mortality and aging," and each may play a very small role, but adding them up creates a "substantial amount of variation for premature mortality, far exceeding" that posed by genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your income, postcode and background shouldn't determine your chances of living a long and healthy life," Bryan Williams, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, said in a news release. "But this pioneering study reinforces that this is the reality for far too many people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Study nuts and bolts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was led by researchers from Oxford Population Health in collaboration with researchers from the departments of psychiatry and anthropology at the University of Oxford; Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute, Boston; the University of Amsterdam; Erasmus University, Rotterdam; and the University of Montpellier. They also got technical help from the China Kadoorie Biobank team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data researchers used included extensive genetic and phenotype information on 502,505 people who were participants in UK Biobank research and data collection. They looked at 164 environmental facts and genetic risk scores for 22 major diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key part of the research was an "aging clock" that used blood protein levels to see how fast people aged. "This enabled them to link environmental exposures that predict early mortality with biological aging," the team said in background material on the study. The measure has also been validated in large studies in China and Finland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cornelia van Duijn, St. Cross professor of epidemiology at Oxford Population Health and the paper's senior author, noted that instead of focusing on individual exposures and hypotheses, they used a hypothesis-free, lifetime exposure approach to see what drives disease and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Genes vs. lifestyle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Environmental factors explained 17% of the death risk variation, while genetic predisposition "as we understand it at present" explained just 2%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of the 25 environmental factors, those with the most impact on healthy or unhealthy aging were smoking, socioeconomic status, physical activity and living conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking was linked to 21 diseases, while socioeconomic factors like household income, employment and home ownership were linked to 19 diseases. Physical activity impacted 17.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Of the factors, 23 could be changed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early life exposures, including whether your mother smoked around the time of your birth and your body weight at 10 years old, influenced aging and risk of death decades later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Environmental exposure had a greater effect on lung, heart and liver disease, while genetic risk was stronger for dementia and breast cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research demonstrates the profound health impact of exposures that can be changed either by individuals or through policies to improve socioeconomic conditions, reduce smoking, or promote physical activity. While genes play a key role in brain conditions and some cancers, our findings highlight opportunities to mitigate the risks of chronic diseases of the lung, heart and liver which are leading causes of disability and death globally," said van Duijn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added, "The early life exposures are particularly important as they show that environmental factors accelerate aging early in life but leave ample opportunity to prevent long-lasting diseases and early death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Austin Argentieri, lead author of the study at Oxford Population Health and research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the approach they used made the research the "most comprehensive to date of the environmental and lifestyle factors driving aging and premature death. These findings underscore the potential benefits of focusing interventions on our environments, socioeconomic contexts and behaviors for the prevention of many age-related diseases and premature death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente in Colorado will be an inaugural member of the newly announced Food Is Medicine Colorado coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.projectangelheart.org/"&gt;Project Angel Heart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://feedingcolorado.org/"&gt;Feeding Colorado&lt;/a&gt; launched the coalition at the 2024 Colorado Food Is Medicine Summit. The event was co-sponsored by Kaiser Permanente.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIMCO will be a statewide coalition of community-based organizations, state agencies, hospitals, and health care organizations. FIMCO will promote recognition of healthy food as a cost-effective way to manage health conditions in Colorado. It will also integrate Food Is Medicine into mainstream health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Kaiser Permanente has been a leader in supporting Food Is Medicine efforts in Colorado and nationally,” said Kate Johnston, chief operating officer of Project Angel Heart. “We look forward to the valuable health care expertise that they will bring to this coalition."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As the idea of Food Is Medicine has grown, these programs have clearly shown their clinical benefits,” said Jeff Krawcek, MD, president and executive medical director of Kaiser Permanente in Colorado. “If we can improve people’s health or prevent them from getting sick in the first place, that is a major win for health care in Colorado.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an inaugural member of FIMCO, Kaiser Permanente is the first health care organization to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to lead Colorado’s health care community in this space and gather more industry support for Food Is Medicine,” said Mike Ramseier, president of Kaiser Permanente in Colorado. “It’s part of our mission to improve the health of the communities we serve, and FIMCO is designed to make a coordinated impact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food Is Medicine has the potential to reduce hospital readmissions and decrease individual treatment costs for conditions like diabetes or cardiovascular diseases. Those shifts could save the American health care system nearly $14 billion per year, according to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797397"&gt;a study from the Tufts University Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationally, Kaiser Permanente recently announced its &lt;a href="/news/press-release-archive/launching-the-food-is-medicine-center-of-excellence"&gt;Food Is Medicine Center of Excellence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The center will shape the future of Food Is Medicine across health care. It will expand food insecurity screening for Kaiser Permanente members, expand training for health professionals, and create new approaches to Food Is Medicine interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will also serve as a research hub. And the center will expand partnerships with local nonprofits, government agencies, and businesses to improve nutrition security for Kaiser Permanente members and our communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente is also a founding member of the &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/02/06/tufts-university-and-leading-health-care-organizations-launch-food-medicine-national"&gt;Food is Medicine Network of Excellence&lt;/a&gt; alongside the Tufts University Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School. The network will establish best practices for implementing, evaluating, and integrating food-based interventions into health care systems and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

For a good example, check out this &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@flaircontentbyamber/video/7171688313349246213?lang=en&amp;amp;q=brain%20flossing&amp;amp;t=1740061816249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;link from TikTok creator @flaircontentbyamber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have anxiety, ruminating thoughts, or distracting &lt;a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/20-facts-about-adhd-no-one-ever-tells-you-17907406" class="T3D"&gt;symptoms of ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, then you might experience an immediate sense of calm while listening to bilateral music — and that’s all part of its appeal. Under @flaircontentbyamber’s video, one person said, “Why did this make me start crying? Pure relief.” Another wrote, “It quiets my ADHD and lets me focus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creator @living.withadhd also &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@livingwith.adhd/video/7142143766491598085?lang=en&amp;amp;q=brain%20flossing&amp;amp;t=1740061816249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;posted a bilateral song&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s since gained nearly 500,000 likes. “I can literally feel it moving from one side of my brain to the other,” one person wrote in the comments. Another said, “This is the first time I’ve felt that flossing/pulling/tingling feeling in my frontal lobes. Weird but nice.” Here’s what to know about brain flossing, according to an expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Does “Brain Flossing” Feel So Good?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.charliehealth.com/author/dr-caroline-fenkel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;Dr. Caroline Fenkel, LCSW&lt;/a&gt;, a therapist and chief clinical officer at &lt;a href="https://www.charliehealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;Charlie Health&lt;/a&gt;, bilateral music is designed to engage both the right and left hemispheres of your brain in a specific pattern that promotes relaxation, focus, and even emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rhythmic left-right stimulation helps calm the nervous system, similar to how bilateral stimulation is used in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5061320/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;therapies like EMDR&lt;/a&gt; [eye movement desensitization and reprocessing],” she tells Bustle. “It supports emotional processing [...] making it easier to work through feelings without being overwhelmed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why this type of music could lead to an emotional release, like a big sigh or a sob sesh, but it can also feel soothing when you’re stressed. As Fenkel says, it helps you feel relaxed because it quiets racing thoughts, and that’s why it can also prep your brain for rest. The bouncy nature of the music helps block out that incessant, internal chatter that might keep you up at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some say this type of music immediately quiets their mind in a way they never thought possible, “similar to the effects of &lt;a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/deep-breathing-exercises-can-help-with-insomnia-according-to-experts-heres-how-to-do-them-15826460" class="T3D"&gt;meditation or deep breathing&lt;/a&gt;,” says Fenkel. “Some research suggests it may also influence brainwave activity, shifting the brain into a calmer state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Best Times To Brain Floss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the mood to chill, pull up a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=bilateral%20music&amp;amp;t=1740078890515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="T3D"&gt;bilateral song on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; or YouTube. While it’s best to listen with headphones, you can also hold your phone horizontally in front of you to get the same effect as the track bounces between your phone’s speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can listen anytime, anywhere, even if you don’t have &lt;a href="https://www.bustle.com/wellness/what-its-like-to-be-on-medication-for-anxiety-and-adhd" class="T3D"&gt;anxiety or ADHD&lt;/a&gt;. “Anyone can listen to bilateral music,” says Fenkel. “It’s a simple, non-invasive tool that can support focus, relaxation, and emotional regulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try it while &lt;a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-deal-with-travel-anxiety-during-the-holidays-according-to-science-13201169" class="T3D"&gt;traveling to soothe anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, while studying to block out annoying noises, or before bed when you want to keep your brain nice and quiet so you can quickly nod off. “Some people also use it during meditation or mindfulness practices to deepen relaxation,” she says. Simply kick back, listen, and let our brain get flossed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Studies referenced:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amano, T.

Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; — will not meet for its regularly scheduled February meeting, a senior HHS official confirmed Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was to meet from Feb. 26 to 28, its first gathering since the Trump administration took office. That will not happen, Andrew Nixon, the HHS director of communications, told STAT in an email. Later on Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a notice&lt;/a&gt; of the postponement was posted on the ACIP’s homepage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nixon did not directly answer STAT’s query of when the meeting would be held instead, saying only that it is “upcoming.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, whose first day at HHS was Tuesday, has denounced the ACIP in the past. During his &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/29/rfk-jr-confirmation-hearing-analysis-kennedy-diagnoses-problems-but-fails-with-remedies/"&gt;Senate confirmation process&lt;/a&gt;, he told the Finance Committee that 97% of ACIP members had conflicts of interest — a claim that people familiar with the rigorous vetting process ACIP members undergo have refuted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The CDC staff that organizes the committee’s work has for weeks been trying to get final approval from HHS to hold the meeting, without success. Until last week, the subcommittees or work groups that do the preparatory work for meetings of the full committee had been barred from meeting due to the c&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/22/trump-administration-orders-health-communications-pause-cdc-hhs-fda/"&gt;ommunications “pause” the administration placed on federal health agencies&lt;/a&gt; soon after President Trump’s inauguration. The subcommittee meetings were allowed to resume last week, multiple sources told STAT.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;For a time, the CDC thought the ACIP meeting could take place, and in person on the agency’s campus, though plans were recently made to shift it to an online session as the secretariat waited for final approval to convene the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The meeting — &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/agenda-2025-02-26-28-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the agenda&lt;/a&gt; for which has been online since early January — was to be held to discuss multiple vaccine issues, and to vote on recommendations for the use of a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-vaccine-prevent-disease-caused-chikungunya-virus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;newly approved vaccine&lt;/a&gt; to prevent chikungunya, a mosquito-borne disease; a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2025/02/18/fda-hhs-trump-zoetis-vaccines-gsk-sanofi-novo-insulin-rna-africa-roche-moderna-uk-michigan/"&gt;new meningitis vaccine from GSK&lt;/a&gt;, to be marketed as Penmenvy; as well as new recommendations on influenza and RSV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All advisory committee meetings where votes will take place must have a period for public comment. Members of the public can submit written comments, or ask to enter a lottery to be allowed to make a verbal comment during the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But because HHS would not formally authorize the meeting to proceed, the portal through which public comments would be submitted was not opened. Sources said that this was the final trigger for the decision of the CDC’s ACIP secretariat to ask to postpone the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nixon said in his brief email that the meeting would be “postponed to accommodate public comment in advance of the meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health experts have been concerned about the future of this committee, which for years has helped the CDC decide how to use approved vaccines most effectively. Vaccines that are recommended by the ACIP must be covered by health insurance, if the CDC director signs off on its recommendations. CDC directors have rarely rejected those recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly two dozen groups of medical professionals and issue advocacy groups, including the American Medical Association, the Gerontological Society of America, and a range of individual medical professionals and public health experts wrote &lt;a href="https://www.fightinfectiousdisease.org/post/sign-on-letter-to-preserve-acip-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an open letter&lt;/a&gt; Thursday to Kennedy and acting CDC Director Susan Monarez urging them to promptly reschedule the meeting. The campaign is being spearheaded by the Partnership to Fight Infectious Disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dorit Reiss, a law professor at UC Law San Francisco who follows the work of the ACIP closely, called the postponement “problematic in several ways,” noting that there were important votes set to be held.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reiss also said the move “raises suspicions that Mr. Kennedy will not keep his word to Senator [Bill] Cassidy that he will not interfere with ACIP recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cassidy, a supporter of vaccines, was clearly hesitant to support Kennedy because of his controversial opinions about the safety of vaccines, which &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/30/rfk-jr-vaccines-autism-confirmation-hearing/"&gt;Kennedy refused to walk back during his Senate confirmation process&lt;/a&gt;. Cassidy agreed to support Kennedy, however, after receiving &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/04/rfk-jr-confirmation-vote-analysis-hard-line-on-vaccines-gop-senators-warn-trump-hhs-nominee/"&gt;a list of assurances&lt;/a&gt;, including that Kennedy would “work within current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems and not establish parallel systems, and uphold the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee recommendations.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other experts expressed concern that this postponement is a harbinger of the possible dissolution of the committee — at least in its present form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul Offit, an infectious diseases expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, noted that Project 2025, a set of policy recommendations that was led by the conservative Heritage Foundation and that is seen by some as a playbook for Trump’s second term, states that CDC officials should not be allowed to make recommendations regarding vaccination requirements for school entry; those decisions should be left to parents and medical providers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think that’s what this is. This is step 1 of trying to eliminate CDC as a group that makes [vaccine] recommendations,” he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ACIP plays several roles. It sometimes advises on which vaccines can be administered together safely. At other times the committee explores signals of risk to vaccine recipients to see whether use recommendations ought to be altered. Concerns about the risk of developing Guillain-Barré syndrome, a form of temporary paralysis, following receipt of two of the RSV vaccines for older adults led the committee to recommend &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/26/cdc-rsv-acip-hearing/"&gt;much more restrictive use&lt;/a&gt; of the products than manufacturers would have liked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fears about the committee’s future were only amplified when Trump signed an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/commencing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday titled “Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy.” One section of the order instructs aides to review existing federal advisory committees — ACIP is one — and report within 30 days on which should be terminated “on [the] grounds that they are unnecessary.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A CDC source told STAT that the agency was asked Wednesday to provide written justification for the existence of several federal advisory committees that operate under its aegis. There are roughly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/faca/committees/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;20 federal advisory committees&lt;/a&gt; that advise the CDC on topics ranging from the incidence of breast cancer in young women to injury prevention and mine safety. Members of these committees &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/apply-for-membership/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;are not paid employees&lt;/a&gt;, but receive travel expenses and, at least in the case of the ACIP, may be offered a $250 honorarium for the days on which they attend ACIP meetings, when they are designated as “special government employees.” Members are not paid for the time they spend on the work groups that do the bulk of the committee’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a significant development for pancreatic cancer treatment, a phase 1 clinical trial has highlighted the potential of personalized mRNA vaccines to treat the deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This research comes at a critical time, as pancreatic cancer is known for its grim prognosis, with less than 13% of patients surviving beyond five years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disease is often diagnosed at advanced stages due to a lack of early symptoms and routine screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pancreatic-cancer-woes"&gt;Pancreatic cancer woes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer is particularly challenging because around 90% of cases are found when they are already advanced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The nature of this cancer often allows it to spread to other parts of the body before it can be effectively treated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional methods like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation are limited in their ability to cure the disease, which has led researchers to seek innovative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vinod Balachandran, who leads the Olayan Center for Cancer Vaccines at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, expressed the urgent need for new options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Despite advancements in treatments for other cancers, pancreatic cancer remains largely resistant, with a survival rate that has stagnated around 10% even following the best available therapies,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before the COVID-19 pandemic popularized mRNA technology, researchers already explored its potential for cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This innovative approach educates the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. The technology is also being tested for other types of cancer, such as melanoma and colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For an mRNA vaccine to be effective, it must generate a strong response from T cells, a type of immune cell that combats infections and diseases. These T cells must remain active over time to fight cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While training T cells to attack viruses is comparatively straightforward, teaching them to target cells the body has created is considerably more complex.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The challenge is particularly pronounced in pancreatic cancer. For a vaccine to successfully prompt the immune system to identify tumor cells, there &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08508-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;must&lt;/a&gt; be unique targets present on those cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cancer cells develop from mutations, and these mutations can &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/health/pancreatic-cancer-dna-study" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;serve&lt;/a&gt; as targets. However, pancreatic tumors generally have fewer mutations available, leading to skepticism about the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines for this cancer type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-mrna-vaccine-may-extend-life-by-8-to-10-years"&gt;New mRNA vaccine may extend life by 8 to 10 years&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recent trial aimed to test this assumption by exploring the efficacy of personalized mRNA vaccines in a group with operable pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This was a follow-up study to an initial trial conducted earlier in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Phase 1 trials are designed to assess safety and initial effectiveness, and this new study included 16 patients whose tumors could be surgically removed—a rare situation, as only about 20% of pancreatic cancers are operable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to surgical treatment, these participants were given personalized mRNA vaccines tailored to their tumor profiles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers monitored the patients for up to four years after tumor removal, assessing the vaccine’s ability to stimulate an immune response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Results showed that half of the participants—eight out of 16—responded positively to the vaccine, producing T cells capable of targeting their tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other half did not show any measurable response. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among those who responded, the vaccine appeared to &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/health/new-blood-test-pancreatic-cancer" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;significantly&lt;/a&gt; prolong the lifespan of the T cells, with estimates suggesting they could last nearly eight years in the body and around 20% of these cells may persist and function for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that the mRNA vaccine may not only activate an immune response but could potentially enhance the longevity of T cells, crucial for long-term protection &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/can-mrna-vaccines-fight-pancreatic-cancer-msk-clinical-researchers-are-trying-find-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;against&lt;/a&gt; cancer recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this study marks a promising step forward in the fight against pancreatic cancer, it remains one of the first stages of research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further trials will be necessary to evaluate mRNA vaccines’ effectiveness and broader applicability in treating this challenging cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Interesting Engineering</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 20:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPWlRTNXdUZ3lfYzRaNmktQ0lqcW5acGtHbWI5TWVQcmNiWHRxSDZLUFVYamx4d3RoRC1wQTcwenJZaEowOVhIRTJWdUVnLUd1T3piczFSRXNPeVdobmpjSDdRTDhvQVVYcXkwdXcxRTZkMFZKeGpMREk4NnFqbGpxcnBLcWs4UXhlR0xsZFJpYXd4MkE</guid></item><item><title>The #1 Habit to Start for Better Gut Health, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTFBMVVhpaUxrdU40VWl5NVRHdDExNndkOThWSHFkbzN0clRzQ0Y0cGktakx6TEd1OV9TSDIzWEZqanJETTMwYmFHMlFWRjZNMG1hU3UxVWYwcWdKMVpBeFctMVFmYkN4cm5nMW9jd243NDZCa0NEZi13M1FGT1o?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to feeling your best, your gut microbiome— a rich ecosystem of microbes in your intestines—plays a pivotal role. In addition to better digestion, maintaining a healthy gut can also have positive effects on your immune system, mental health, weight and energy levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many factors affect gut health. However, the #1 habit to promote a healthy and diverse gut microbiome is by eating a diet that regularly contains probiotic-rich foods. We spoke with dietitians to better understand why probiotics matter and how they benefit your digestive system. We also asked them to share practical tips for adding probiotic-rich foods to your diet and other strategies to help your gut thrive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-eating-probiotic-foods-regularly-is-the-1-habit-to-promote-better-gut-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Eating Probiotic Foods Regularly Is the #1 Habit to Promote Better Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that naturally reside in your gut. They’re also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;found in fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; like yogurt, kombucha and kimchi. From better digestion to a stronger immune system, let’s take a closer look at some benefits of eating more probiotic-rich foods. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Probiotics Can Help Support Digestive Health  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your gut is home to trillions of bacteria, collectively known as the gut microbiome. A balanced and varied microbiome is important for maintaining digestive health. &lt;a href="http://www.simplywellnessllc.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sammy Peterson, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian and holistic health expert at Simply Wellness says that studies have found probiotics to be important for digestion, reducing inflammation and promoting overall gut health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can find probiotics in supplements, but research suggests that getting them from whole foods is especially beneficial. A 2021 study found that eating foods like yogurt, kefir and kimchi helped increase gut bacteria diversity and reduce inflammation—key markers of good gut health—in healthy adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Probiotics May Enhance Immune Function &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Did you know that approximately 70-80% of your immune system resides in your gut? A well-balanced microbiome, supported by probiotics in our diet, can help regulate immune responses and protect against pathogens, like viruses. “[Probiotics] can help restore the balance of the gut microbiota, by counteracting disruptions from antibiotics, infections and stress while naturally crowding out harmful microbes,” says Peterson.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="http://nicoleibarrard.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nicole Ibarra, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;, media registered dietitian and owner of Altitude Nutrition &amp;amp; Fitness also emphasizes this connection, saying that studies have found probiotics and fermented foods to play a key role in supporting immune function and helping the body fight off infections.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Probiotics May Support Mental Health and Memory &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The gut and brain are intricately connected through something called the “&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8001367/poor-gut-health-increases-anxiety-depression-risk-what-to-eat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut-brain axis&lt;/a&gt;.” Preliminary research suggests that probiotics can influence this connection, potentially improving cognitive function and mood and may even help manage some mental health conditions like depression, anxiety disorders, chronic fatigue syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Additionally, a small study in healthy adults found that drinking a fermented probiotic beverage daily for 4 weeks was associated with significant improvements in memory.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While research is ongoing, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/257793/berry-kefir-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adding kefir to your morning smoothie&lt;/a&gt; could be an easy and nutritious way to boost your mood.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding probiotics to your routine doesn’t have to be complicated. Here are some simple tips to get started:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Small. &lt;/strong&gt;Peterson suggests starting with simple additions, like a small serving of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-sauerkraut-good-for-you-8729233" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sauerkraut&lt;/a&gt; or kimchi, with meals, or sipping on kombucha in place of soda. Ibarra adds that yogurt and kefir are great starter options since their mild flavors make them easy to blend into smoothies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a Daily Habit. &lt;/strong&gt;Consistency is key, so try to find a sustainable way to enjoy probiotics every day. Prep &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-snack-for-more-energy-8776152" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;yogurt parfaits for an afternoon snack&lt;/a&gt;, or enjoy a glass of kefir with breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stir In Some Miso&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7958146/what-is-miso-and-how-do-i-use-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Miso, a fermented soybean paste&lt;/a&gt;, is an easy way to add probiotics to savory dishes. “Stir miso into soups, stews, chili or dressings for an extra gut-friendly boost,” recommends Peterson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Labels Carefully.&lt;/strong&gt; When buying probiotic foods, look for phrases like “live and active cultures” on the label. When possible, opt for refrigerated versions, as shelf-stable fermented foods are often pasteurized, which kills the beneficial bacteria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-improve-gut-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Improve Gut Health  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While probiotics are great for your gut, they’re just one part of the equation for a healthy digestive system. Here are a few additional habits to consider:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Plenty of Prebiotic Foods.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291159/what-are-prebiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Prebiotics&lt;/a&gt; are non-digestible fibers that feed the good bacteria in your gut. You can find them in a variety of plant-based foods like garlic, onions, asparagus, bananas and oats. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Fiber.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to prebiotics, eating more total fiber supports digestion and overall gut health.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;A simple way to do this is by incorporating a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables into your meals throughout the week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Moving.&lt;/strong&gt; “Engaging in regular physical activity as part of your everyday routine, even as simple as a 15-minute walk, can help enhance gut bacteria diversity,” says Peterson. Exercise also helps reduce inflammation, which Peterson says can support optimal gut barrier function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a Consistent Eating Pattern. &lt;/strong&gt;Ibarra suggests spacing meals 3 to 4 hours apart to keep your digestive system running smoothly. “When you skip meals or go several hours without eating, it slows your digestive system down, which can lead to constipation and other digestive symptoms,” she says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, miso and kimchi to your diet is a simple and flavorful way to nourish your gut. Not only are probiotic-rich foods important for your digestive system, but they may also help strengthen your immune system and even boost your mood. Pairing these foods with other healthy habits like eating fiber-rich foods, not skipping meals and engaging in physical activity can set the stage for a happy, healthy gut.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

AUGUST 06: A view of the sign of Center for Disease Control headquarters is seen &lt;span class="plus" data-ga-track="caption expand"&gt;... [+]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="expanded-caption"&gt; in Atlanta, Georgia, United States .

&lt;p&gt;The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has terminated a successful flu vaccination campaign educating the public on the efficacy and benefits of flu vaccines, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated" aria-label="NPR"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated"&gt;NPR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The campaign, which uses infographics by depicting wild animals next to more tame animals, seeks to promote awareness on how immunization can help protect individuals from the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241224210044/https:/www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/shareable-resources/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://web.archive.org/web/20241224210044/https:/www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/shareable-resources/index.html" aria-label="webpage"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://web.archive.org/web/20241224210044/https:/www.cdc.gov/flu-resources/php/shareable-resources/index.html"&gt;webpage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has now been archived, although some information on the flu vaccination campaign can still be found &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2023-2024-new-campaign-wild-to-mild.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu-resources%2Fphp%2Ftoolkit%2Fchronic-conditions.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2023-2024-new-campaign-wild-to-mild.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu-resources%2Fphp%2Ftoolkit%2Fchronic-conditions.html" aria-label="online"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/2023-2024-new-campaign-wild-to-mild.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu-resources%2Fphp%2Ftoolkit%2Fchronic-conditions.html"&gt;online&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The HHS had allegedly reviewed the campaign and decided it would not continue, as reported in NPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the campaign is to inform the general public that vaccines still provide the best protection against the common flu. Although vaccines do not necessarily prevent the flu and individuals can certainly get the flu even after vaccination, the rate of complications like infection of the lung are significantly diminished, and symptoms from flu for those vaccinated tend to be much milder when compared to those who get the flu and are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The removal of this important campaign could not come at a more inopportune time. Flu cases are the highest they have been in the last decade, with at least 29 million flu illnesses this season, 370,000 hospitalizations and 16,000 deaths, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message also remains indispensable given the current Texas measles outbreak, with 58 reported cases. Although the majority of cases have been reported in those unvaccinated, at least &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/health/texas-measles-outbreak/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/health/texas-measles-outbreak/index.html" aria-label="four individuals"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/health/texas-measles-outbreak/index.html"&gt;four individuals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; claim that they have received the measles vaccine. The flu vaccination campaign would help educate people on a common question- why are people who are vaccinated getting measles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timely infographic demonstrates that immunization does not necessarily prevent individuals from getting the infection, but rather provides protection and makes symptoms more tame or mild. This critical information is necessary so the public understands the efficacy of vaccines and why vaccinated patients can still get infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terminating the campaign also comes at a time when thousands of probationary workers in the most influential federal health care sectors have been laid off, including personnel at the HHS, NIH and CDC. As I explained recently in &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/15/trump-administration-lays-off-cdcs-epidemic-intelligence-service-workers-threatening-science-and-public-health/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/15/trump-administration-lays-off-cdcs-epidemic-intelligence-service-workers-threatening-science-and-public-health/" target="_self" aria-label="Forbes"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/15/trump-administration-lays-off-cdcs-epidemic-intelligence-service-workers-threatening-science-and-public-health/"&gt;Forbes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, these public health experts are critical in protecting and safeguarding health for Americans and individuals all around the world. These workers have been instrumental in carrying out groundbreaking research that have helped discover cures and vaccines. They have been indispensable in containing deadly infectious diseases, in developing key tests that help us identify various diseases and help communicate important public health information so all of us can stay safe and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It has been only one month into the Trump presidency, and science and public health have been under constant fire. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/08/how-the-trump-administration-could-amplify-health-inequities-in-america-and-across-the-globe/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/08/how-the-trump-administration-could-amplify-health-inequities-in-america-and-across-the-globe/" target="_self" aria-label="Foreign aid"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/omerawan/2025/02/08/how-the-trump-administration-could-amplify-health-inequities-in-america-and-across-the-globe/"&gt;Foreign aid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to help fight important diseases like Malaria, TB and HIV has been curtailed. Trump’s Secretary for Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been confirmed by the Senate, a well-known vaccine skeptic that has repeatedly spread misinformation that vaccines cause autism. And now, vital public health information is being taken down from websites, threatening the public’s ability to understand public health and make important informed decisions about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2025 represents a time of enormous public health challenges, from threats of the bird flu, to the common flu surging to outbreaks of Measles and Ebola being reported across the globe. This is not a time for putting the brakes on public health. If anything, the Trump administration should be putting their foot on the accelerator to ensure there is adequate staff to address all these public health issues. If the COVID-19 pandemic taught us anything, it is that there must be transparency and a wealth of important information accessible to everyone so people can make decisions to protect themselves and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firing healthcare personnel and purging public health websites will do nobody any good.&lt;/p&gt;

The primary cause of death during a cocaine overdose is stroke or cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since its heyday in the 1980s, the rate of cocaine overdose deaths nationwide has varied widely over the years.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But around 2015, the year in which Dr Palamar and his colleagues say the fourth wave of the drug crisis kicked off, cocaine deaths rose precipitously.

&lt;p&gt;A painful burning sensation in a woman's legs turned out to be the result of a parasite burrowing into her brain, her doctors have revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 30-year-old, from New England, likely contracted the parasite while travelling in Hawaii, according to a case report published Feb. 13 in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412514" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412514" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her symptoms began with a strange burning sensation in her feet. Over the coming days, the pain spread up her legs, and the impacted areas became sensitive to even the lightest touch. She was also fatigued, but she initially attributed that to jet lag following a three-week trip to Thailand, Japan and Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She went to an emergency department about the sensations in her legs, but her exams came back normal and she was ultimately discharged. Days later, the sensations spread to her truck and arms and she developed a headache. So she went to a second emergency department, and again, her exams were "reportedly normal," although her immune-cell count was up. She received medications that relieved her headache before being discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/32-scary-parasitic-diseases" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/32-scary-parasitic-diseases"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32 scary parasitic diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After about a week of these symptoms, the woman developed confusion and her partner brought her to hospital once again. Her blood tests and kidney function were still normal, and microscopic examination of her blood showed no obvious signs of parasites. However, one thing that did stand out was an elevated level of a type of white blood cell called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23402-eosinophils" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23402-eosinophils" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eosinophils&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; these cells help the body fight off foreign invaders, including parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical team then performed a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, to draw out a sample of cerebrospinal fluid. This fluid surrounds the spinal cord and brain. This test also revealed a very high level of eosinophils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-kcSVXioNXxcqHouqzG7ZeN" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-kcSVXioNXxcqHouqzG7ZeN slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her results were consistent with a condition known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/about/parasitic-meningitis.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/about/parasitic-meningitis.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eosinophilic meningitis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a rare form of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord often caused by parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the case report, the most common cause of eosinophilic meningitis is rat lungworm (&lt;em&gt;Angiostrongylus cantonensis), &lt;/em&gt;a parasite that lives in many tropical and subtropical regions in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After ruling out other culprits, the team determined &lt;em&gt;A. cantonensis&lt;/em&gt; was behind the woman's case. While the parasite was not detected in the patient's blood, further testing of her cerebrospinal fluid revealed genetic traces of the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adult form of the parasite primarily lives inside rodents. Their larvae then pass out through the rodent's feces, at which point they are eaten by slugs and snails. These larvae mature inside the mollusks until their host is eventually eaten by a rat or other rodent, and the life cycle starts again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a human eats an infected mollusk that's raw or undercooked, or a raw vegetable that has been contaminated with their slime, they can also become infected. Shellfish, including land crabs and freshwater prawns, may also become contaminated if they eat an infected slug or snail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all people who ingest &lt;em&gt;A. cantonensis&lt;/em&gt; experience symptoms, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/angiostrongylus/about/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/angiostrongylus/about/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, in some cases the larvae migrate to the host's central nervous system and reach the brain — in some lab animals, this can happen within four hours of ingestion, the case report notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in the human brain, the parasite can trigger headaches, a stiff neck, vomiting, confusion, tingling or burning sensations and eventually, seizures and vision problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, &lt;em&gt;A. cantonensis&lt;/em&gt; infections resolve on their own as the parasites die off, even in cases of meningitis, the CDC says. In those cases, supportive treatments might include painkillers and antiinflammatories. That said, these infections can sometimes be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the woman's case, the patient was given a 14-day course of antiparasitic medication, together with a steroid drug to help bring down inflammation in her nervous system. She was discharged from hospital after six days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent infection with rat lungworms like &lt;em&gt;A. cantonensis&lt;/em&gt; , the CDC recommends that people not eat raw or undercooked snails or slugs, frogs, shrimp or prawns. They should wear gloves and wash hands after handling snails or slugs in the garden. The agency also adds that people should always wash fresh produce thoroughly and avoid eating uncooked vegetables in areas where the parasite is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-an-endemic-disease" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-an-endemic-disease"&gt;&lt;u&gt;endemic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-kcSVXioNXxcqHouqzG7ZeN-AN2HkijRUkVUv0xCkRcg6S5KwqMbn4yU" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-kcSVXioNXxcqHouqzG7ZeN-AN2HkijRUkVUv0xCkRcg6S5KwqMbn4yU slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This is because &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; can help us “stay vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades”, says Ollie Thompson, personal trainer and founder of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://welltolead.com/"&gt;Welltolead&lt;/a&gt;, a performance-focused health coaching company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, the benefits of maintaining healthy muscle are highly underrated,” he says. “Resistance training is crucial for long-term &lt;a href="/news/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; – not just from a movement perspective, staying physically strong and mobile, but also for maintaining overall physiological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent resistance training enhances metabolic function by improving insulin sensitivity, supports cardiovascular health by reducing &lt;a href="/topic/blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, helps maintain hormonal balance to combat age-related declines, preserves bone density to reduce fracture risk, and strengthens the immune system to help fight off disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to help you build strength, Thompson has shared three &lt;a href="/topic/gyms"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; exercises he believes hold the most value if training for &lt;a href="/topic/longevity"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; is your goal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-2 epFywa EqCSl"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assisted chin-up &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bulgarian split squat &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farmer’s carry &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 kULwBk fWblEi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on my experience, if we define longevity as living better for longer – with an emphasis on staying vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades – then these are the top three gym exercises for longevity,” says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, they can strengthen muscles across your upper and lower body, boosting joint health, developing balance and coordination, and improving your posture, among other perks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/anne-hathaway-workout-trainer-plank-b2695184.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This one-move workout from Anne Hathaway’s trainer builds core stability in just three minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do an assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-48000"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place a barbell in a rack at roughly chest height. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit on the ground under the barbell then reach overhead and grasp it with an underhand grip, hands roughly shoulder-width apart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your feet on the floor for support, pull your body upwards until your chin is above the bar. Think about squeezing your shoulder blades together as you do this. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly control yourself back to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over time, try to provide less support with your feet to make the exercise more challenging, in line with your increasing strength levels. You can also use an assisted pull-up machine or resistance band to perform this exercise. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/courteney-cox-chin-up-workout-b2625004.html"&gt;chin-up&lt;/a&gt; has a somewhat intimidating reputation. But by using a machine, resistance band or even a lower pull-up bar and supporting yourself with your feet, Thompson says it can be scaled to suit most fitness levels. And adding it to your regular routine unlocks plenty of benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up not only recruits multiple muscles across your back, biceps, forearms and core, but it’s also one of the best things you can do to develop a healthy set of shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One key reason I picked the assisted chin-up is that performing a full repetition – from a dead hang to the top with your chin at the bar – takes your shoulder blades through a full range of motion,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the bottom hanging position, with your hands supinated [palms towards you], you create external rotation at the shoulder joint while under load with your arms overhead – an excellent way to maintain strong, stable and well-functioning shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, this exercise can’t be beaten for training grip strength, which &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6778477/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have strongly correlated with healthier muscle mass and better longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/stanley-tucci-workout-b2630043.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley Tucci got into the ‘best shape of his life’ at 63 with this training method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-48001"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand one step in front of a bench or sturdy surface that’s around knee height. Face away from this surface. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in your left hand with your arm by your side, palm facing your body. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your right leg long and your hips square, place the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your left knee until it’s just above the ground, keeping your chest up as you do this, then drive through your right foot to return to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up promises to strengthen multiple muscles across your upper body, and the Bulgarian split squat mirrors this for your lower half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a unilateral [single-limb] exercise, it’s excellent for building strength and stability at the hip, knee and foot, helping to correct severe muscular imbalances while also incorporating a balance component,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also challenges kinaesthetic awareness – your ability to sense your position and movement in space – which is a crucial skill for preventing trips and falls in later life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some impressive longevity credentials, and the Bulgarian split squat has another trick up its sleeve that elevates it above standard &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-squat-correctly-b2606171.html"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, in Thompson’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a huge fan of this exercise because, when performed correctly, it not only engages every major muscle in the leg but also forces you into hip extension,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This position, where the leg moves behind the hip and midline, tends to weaken significantly with age. Developing strength and mobility in this range plays a key role in maintaining movement quality and walking mechanics, and it can also be instrumental in reducing back pain, hip pain and dysfunction in these areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps a day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the farmer’s carry &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-48002"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in each hand with your arms by your side and your palms facing inwards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining an upright torso and tight core, walk with the weights. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the farmer’s carry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farmer’s carry is a refreshingly straightforward exercise: simply pick up a couple of &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-dumbbells-home-hand-weights-b1847563.html"&gt;dumbbells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-kettlebell-set-workout-b1837551.html"&gt;kettlebells&lt;/a&gt; and take them for a walk. This simplicity means it’s overlooked, but Thompson says those who omit it are missing out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The farmer’s carry is an exercise I don’t see performed nearly as often as it should be. Here’s why: it’s a full-body movement that involves ambulation, it tests your grip strength and it’s fantastic for improving posture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It builds strong joints, enhances hip stability, challenges your balance, coordination and kinaesthetic awareness, and ultimately provides a brilliant way to build strength while also taxing your aerobic system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it will bolster your heart and lung health by having you breathing heavily, while also strengthening your entire body. The farmer’s carry is a viable option for the vast majority of people too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often prescribe farmer's carries to my online clients because they are incredibly accessible and can be scaled easily, with progress easily tracked. Simply pick a challenging kettlebell or dumbbell, then walk for time, distance, steps or breaths.

But he says cardiovascular exercise – activities that raise your heart rate for a sustained period – should also be among your top priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiovascular exercise is, of course, essential for heart health, but it also plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, reducing the risk of major diseases and cancers, supporting brain health, enhancing energy production, improving sleep quality and managing stress,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As well as resistance training, a well-rounded approach to exercising for longevity includes both low-intensity zone two cardio [performed at roughly 60-70 per cent of your maximum heart rate] and short bouts of high-intensity training. This combination builds both a wide aerobic base and a high aerobic peak – known as VO2 max – which is strongly associated with better health, longevity, and reduced all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/isle-of-man-wellness-retreat-b2696904.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I went on my first wellness retreat, and it wasn’t what I expected at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPTExxTFI5RVA0MVJjcExqbHJsa0Eyc21WLXBhOUVJVFdyazVoajdHUHU4Q3V3enA5ZktMN2pHYndSOEVMcE4tZ2FBRG9yRXhIbVdoYXl0cXVuSWRlU0xDMmxBUDdybldrTUYycXFFOHg4NFN2M1NGX1JDZktDeXFUUy0tNHVzeEpYUUFVTDB2VmNRZlRkNHc</guid></item><item><title>A CDC vaccine committee meeting, the first of Kennedy's tenure at HHS, gets postponed - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxORTBXS01rRmwzZlNzbXBZMU5qYnZnd0Z0TjVtYmFBRlBJZ0F4a0lMS0JxRUt2aG5FOFBuc1VvYUFIUTNNcFVOUHZ5V2YtTk8zTWdGdG1IWTNfd253MFVlbmtjTkJwX0Y4cGx4Q0VwcWFUbW44SDJCVndFT0hZZUFlREl2UkN4Ri1KX3ExTzVzV1dzUTlGV2paWjEtUC1iQjRBdnlfU1pqd3TSAVZBVV95cUxQZ1BiMFJENndmanJBMkZCRFlnR1pkcE5xSzU5N3gzdWx0RUlUM0RQSzRTRDhDanlocExfelV1X25hR1pYaWtKZXF1b0RxUWEzclNrX3FmZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory committee meeting scheduled for next week — the first since Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="investigationandresults" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Investigation and Results"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Investigation and Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Identification of First Case and Public Health Notification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2024, the index cat (cat 1A, one of three cats in household 1), aged 5 years, exclusively indoor, spayed female domestic shorthair, experienced decreased appetite, lack of grooming, disorientation, and lethargy, followed by progressive neurologic deterioration. On the second day of illness, the cat was evaluated at a local veterinary clinic; on the fourth day, the cat was referred to the Michigan State University (MSU) Veterinary Medical Center (VMC), a tertiary care facility with advanced diagnostic and treatment capabilities where, because of rapid disease progression, cat 1A was euthanized. Because the cat’s owner had known occupational exposure to dairy cattle, and because highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus was known to be circulating in dairy cattle on Michigan dairy farms, upon approval from the state veterinarian, cat 1A’s remains were submitted to MSU’s veterinary diagnostic laboratory (VDL) for necropsy. Brain and nasal swabs tested by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were positive for influenza A(H5) virus.* Genetic sequencing results identified HPAI A(H5N1) virus, clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed the sequencing results; the virus was indistinguishable from viruses circulating in Michigan dairy cattle&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;). This identification of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection in a domestic house cat resulted in initiation of a public health investigation by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and Mid-Michigan District Health Department (MDHHS/MMDHD). This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Investigation and Public Health Response — Household 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cat 1A lived in a household with two adults, one of whom worked on a dairy farm in a county known to have HPAI A(H5N1)–positive dairy cattle; two adolescents (adolescents 1A and 1B); and two other exclusively indoor cats (cats 1B and 1C) (&lt;a id="F1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#F1_down"&gt;Figure&lt;/a&gt;). Cat 1B was reported to have signs of watery, purulent eye discharge, increased respirations, and decreased appetite 4 days after onset of illness in cat 1A. MSU VMC requested that the owner obtain a swab from cat 1B because the cat was too ill to be taken into the clinic, but specimens were not submitted by the owner. Cat 1B’s illness signs were reported to have resolved 11 days after cat 1A’s illness onset. Cat 1C had no signs of illness when it arrived at MSU VMC and received negative test results for influenza A 11 days after cat 1A’s illness onset. No other indoor or outdoor pets were reported. All four household members had daily contact with all three cats in the home. Although the dairy farm where the adult household member worked was not known to be affected by HPAI A(H5N1) virus, it was located near other affected farms.&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt; This dairy farmworker did not work directly with animals but worked on the dairy farm premises. The worker reported removing work clothes and boots outside when returning to the household; these items were then brought to a location in the home that was not accessible to the cats. The cats and household members did not consume unpasteurized milk or milk products.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical examination of cat 1A by veterinary staff members was notable for signs of severe neurologic disease (obtundation, abnormality of cranial nerves, and abnormal motor function in all four limbs), anorexia, and lethargy. The cat initially had signs of ataxia, decreased appetite, swollen right jaw, abnormal gait, and hiding behavior. Some improvement and return of appetite occurred on day 3, 1 day after the cat received subcutaneous antibiotics. However, on day 4, it could not hold up its head, had an unsteady gait, and displayed all initial signs again; the cat was euthanized on day 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected from three household 1 members (the non farmworker adult and the two adolescents) 11 days after onset of illness in cat 1A; specimens were sent to MDHHS, where they tested negative for influenza A viruses by RT-PCR. The dairy farmworker declined influenza testing. Only one of the three persons tested (adolescent 1A, who had no comorbidities) experienced signs or symptoms of illness (cough, sore throat, headache, and myalgia), which began 6 days after illness onset in cat 1A). The household 1 members who received testing received a 10-day course of twice-daily oral oseltamivir as postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) at the time of testing; the dairy farmworker declined testing and PEP.&lt;sup&gt;††&lt;/sup&gt; Adolescent 1B reported a “dry croupy” cough 6 days after onset of illness in cat 1A that was attributed to severe allergies. Communication with public health representatives ended before final resolution of adolescent 1B’s symptoms was reported. Only adolescent 1A received any positive laboratory test result; this test was for rhinovirus/enterovirus on a multiplex PCR BioFire Film Array Respiratory Panel at MDHHS. Cat 1A’s owner, the dairy farmworker, had regular contact with cat 1A and adolescent 1A; the farmworker reported 1 day of vomiting and diarrhea that preceded onset of illness in cat 1A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Investigation and Public Health Response — Household 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six days after referral of cat 1A to MSU VMC, cat 2A, an exclusively indoor intact male Maine Coon cat aged 6 months from a second household (household 2), was brought by its owner directly to MSU VMC with a 1-day history of progressive neurologic deterioration, anorexia, lethargy, and facial swelling. On initial physical examination of cat 2A, it was found to be obtunded, with abnormalities of cranial nerve function, abnormal motor function, puffiness of the eyes and nose, and minimal movement; the cat died within 24 hours of onset of illness signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cat 2A lived with one additional indoor cat (cat 2B) and its owner, a dairy farmworker. Nasal swabs from cat 2A tested by RT-PCR at MSU VDL, 1 day after onset of cat 2A’s illness signs and upon initial examination, were positive for influenza A viruses and were confirmed as HPAI A(H5N1) virus, clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13 at the United States Department of Agriculture’s NVSL. Cat 2B did not show any signs of illness, and nasal swabs tested negative for influenza A viruses. Cat 2A’s owner transported unpasteurized milk from various farms in a Michigan county that included farms with dairy cattle confirmed to be infected with HPAI A(H5N1) virus and lived in the same county where cat 1A’s owner lived. Cat 2A’s owner did not wear personal protective equipment (PPE) while handling raw milk; reported frequent milk splash exposures to the face, eyes, and clothing; and did not remove work clothing before entering the home when returning from work. Cat 2A’s owner reported that cat 2A would roll in the owner’s work clothes, whereas cat 2B did not exhibit this behavior. Cat 2A’s owner experienced eye irritation that began 2 days before the onset of illness signs in cat 2A but reported no other symptoms. The owner did not receive testing for influenza and declined oseltamivir and further contact with public health officials, stating fear of losing employment as a consequence of communicating with public health officials and implicating farms that provided milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Screening and Testing of Veterinary Staff Members&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veterinary staff members who handled the infected cats at the local veterinary practice or MSU VMC were contacted and enrolled by public health authorities for 10 days of symptom monitoring after their last exposure to the cats. Overall, 24 veterinary staff members, including one veterinarian, five nurses, three technicians, five assistants, two caregivers, three interns, and five students, were potentially exposed to the two ill cats; 18 (75%) were contacted and monitored, but because of their limited exposure, they were not offered PEP.&lt;sup&gt;§§&lt;/sup&gt; PPE protocols are in place for all patients managed in MSU VMC’s isolation unit, where the cats were treated and in laboratory units where specimens were tested. For HPAI A(H5N1), recommended PPE include a Tyvek suit, boot covers, nitrile gloves, a surgical head cover, and a face mask. Veterinary staff members were reported to likely wear surgical masks for the initial encounter of cat 1A and N95 masks thereafter. Varying levels of PPE use were reported by veterinary staff members, which ranged from only using gloves to following full protocol. Laboratory staff members wear either powered air-purifying respirators or N95 respirators. Among seven persons who reported signs or symptoms after exposure to the ill cats, including four who reported nasal congestion and three who reported headache, five agreed to testing; all received negative influenza A RT-PCR test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div class="bg-gray-l2 col-md-9 float-left mb-3 order-0 "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is already known about this topic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoke is a complex mixture of gases and airborne particulate matter; urban fires and conventional wildfires emit different air pollutants. The Atmospheric Science and Chemistry mEasurement NeTwork (ASCENT), a new, advanced air quality measurement network, provides real-time measurements of the chemical constituents in fine particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is added by this report?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the January 2025 Los Angeles fires, ASCENT recorded an approximate 110-fold increase in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; lead levels compared with values from the previous few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the implications for public health practice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban fires emit air pollutants that pose risks different from those of conventional wildfires. It is important for epidemiologic studies to consider PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5 &lt;/sub&gt;composition when assessing the impacts of urban fire smoke exposure. Health officials should communicate protective measures to the public (monitor air quality forecasts and follow guidance by local emergency management officials).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 7, 2025, the Eaton Canyon and Palisades fires blazed across the Los Angeles region, driven by exceptionally dry conditions and Santa Ana wind gusts approaching 100 mph (161 kph). The fires spread rapidly into densely populated neighborhoods along the wildland-urban interface, destroying approximately 16,000 structures. As of February 10, 2025, a total of 29 deaths had been identified.* In addition to the deaths and destruction of property, wildfires emit a complex mixture of air pollutants and contribute to elevated concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;; particulate matter with a diameter &amp;lt;2.5 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;m), degrading air quality many miles downwind. Exposure to wildfire PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; has been linked to adverse health effects including increased asthma cases, respiratory symptoms, aggravated respiratory diseases, and increased overall mortality (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;–&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;). Unlike conventional wildfires that primarily burn natural fuels (e.g., grasslands or forests), the Eaton Canyon and Palisades fires ignited significant portions of the built environment, in which painted surfaces, pipes, vehicles, plastics, electronic equipment, and the structures themselves became the fuel. This widespread combustion of synthetic materials has increased concerns about the toxicity of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;, because a large proportion of the structures affected by the fires were built before 1978, when use of leaded paint was still common. This report focused on measuring airborne PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; lead during the Los Angeles urban fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="investigationandoutcomes" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Investigation and Outcomes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Investigation and Outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atmospheric Science and Chemistry mEasurement NeTwork (ASCENT)&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; is a new, nationwide, multi-institutional initiative funded by the National Science Foundation, to provide continuous measurements of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; chemical components (organics, inorganics, metals, and black carbon) across 12 sites in the United States, including seven urban and five remote or rural areas.&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt; All ASCENT sites were operating and sampling ambient air as of May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles ASCENT site in Pico Rivera, approximately 14 miles (23 kilometers) south of the Eaton Canyon fire, has been operating since July 2023. During and immediately after the Los Angeles fires, southward winds transported the fire plume to the ASCENT site. Hourly PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; lead measurements recorded during and after the fires were reviewed to assess their contribution to atmospheric lead levels. Because this analysis consists of a review of routinely collected environmental data and does not include human subjects, human subjects review was not required by the authors’ institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During January 2–6, 2025, the average PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; lead concentration recorded at the Los Angeles ASCENT site was 0.00068 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. From January 8 to January 11, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; lead concentration increased approximately 110 times with an average concentration of 0.077 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;a id="F1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#F1_down"&gt;Figure&lt;/a&gt;). Recorded PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; lead concentration peaked at approximately 0.5 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; on January 9. By the evening of January 11, PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; lead concentration had returned to levels similar to those before the fire. The presence of heavy metals such as lead is not unusual in urban fire emissions, particularly in California, where legacy pollutants from older infrastructure, industrial sources, and soils can be remobilized during fires (&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;). For example, during the 2018 Camp fire, monitors recorded ambient PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5 &lt;/sub&gt;lead concentrations that averaged 0.13 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; during a period of 17 hours (&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few data illustrate the health effects of lead from inhalation compared with other exposure routes. The ASCENT real-time measurements of airborne lead and other chemical constituents in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; provide valuable PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; chemical composition data that can be combined with health data to examine health effects of individual smoke components from the Los Angeles fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="preliminaryconclusionsandactions" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Preliminary Conclusions and Actions"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Preliminary Conclusions and Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead is a toxic air contaminant that is distributed in multiple human tissues and accumulates in teeth and bones; it affects nearly every organ system, posing significant health risks, particularly for children, who are more vulnerable to its neurodevelopmental effects (&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt;). Regulatory efforts, especially the U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, have resulted in a sharp decline in airborne lead levels during the past 45 years.&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt; The current National Ambient Air Quality Standard for lead in total suspended particles over a 3-month rolling average is 0.15 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.** Measures including removing lead from gasoline and leaded pipes and the banning or limiting of lead in consumer products, such as residential paint, have led to a 97% decrease in airborne lead concentrations in the United States since 1980 (&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt;). However, unlike chronic lead exposure, which has been widely studied, the health effects of brief, elevated lead exposures, such as those described in this report, are not well understood. Additional health research is needed, because airborne lead levels alone do not necessarily indicate exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; is not a single entity but comprises a complex mixture of chemical components with dynamic size distributions, temporal and spatial variations, and toxicity. Whereas the health effects of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; exposure are well documented, studies assessing which sources, chemical compounds, and sizes of particles contribute to health effects are lacking. ASCENT fills in this gap by providing high time-resolution and chemical composition measurements of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; across dynamic size ranges with advanced air quality measurement technologies. The new availability of real-time measurements of the many chemical constituents in PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;, and time-resolved particle size distributions in diverse U.S. locations, has the capacity to improve understanding of health effects associated with particulate matter exposure and contribute to building a foundation for protecting public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="publichealthresponse" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Public Health Response"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Public Health Response&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Enhancing Surveillance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To increase outbreak awareness and improve dengue case recognition among health care providers, PRDH and CDC have conducted 3,030 education and prevention events, reaching approximately 167,000 persons across all eight health regions. These efforts include health fairs, virtual conferences, and community outreach, supported by municipal epidemiologists, central-level educators, and community outreach specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2023, PRDH developed a mandatory dengue training course for medical professionals to raise awareness of dengue and prepare for future outbreaks on the island. Efforts to implement and expand training intensified during the 2024 outbreak, and by November, approximately 10,800 health care providers completed the course through in-person sessions and webinars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve case tracking and reporting, PRDH upgraded the existing arboviral case investigation system to a new, comprehensive database, improving data accuracy and management. CDC and PRDH collaborated to expand dengue testing capacity by providing guidance to commercial laboratories, enabling broader access for patients and more rapid diagnostic testing by working with existing specimen transport and reporting systems at commercial laboratories. In addition, PRDH established a free dengue testing center for patients with a medical order, offering an acute dengue panel with RT-PCR and IgM testing. PRDH also intensified surveillance activities by conducting interviews with all persons with confirmed dengue to collect comprehensive case data, including detailed exposure history and symptom progression. PRDH conducted weekly coordination meetings with CDC, the Puerto Rico Vector Control Unit (PRVCU), and other partners to review trends, update protocols, coordinate messaging and outreach, direct vector control efforts, and refine overall response strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Mosquito Surveillance and Control Activities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support mosquito surveillance and control activities, PRVCU and PRDH Environmental Health staff members collaborated with PRDH epidemiologists to perform mosquito trapping. During January–November 2024, PRVCU captured 234,713 &lt;i&gt;A. aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes across Puerto Rico using autocidal gravid ovitraps. A total of 28,932 mosquito pools were tested using RT-PCR, which identified 316 (1.1%) positive pools. The highest number of positive DENV detections in mosquito pools was recorded in San Juan (250 of 7,985; 3.1%), followed by Bayamón (56 of 18,787; 0.3%), Carolina (nine of 1,865; 0.5%), and Rincón (one of 295; 0.3%). These findings indicated active transmission of DENV-1 (8% of positive pools), DENV-2 (41%), and DENV-3 (51%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In coordination with PRDH and CDC, PRVCU implemented vector control measures, including wide-area larviciding, mass trapping, adulticidal methods (e.g., space sprays targeting mosquitoes in flight and residual sprays creating long-lasting barriers on surfaces to kill resting mosquitoes), and yard inspections to identify and remove mosquito breeding sites to reduce DENV transmission. In addition, PRDH Environmental Health staff members conducted weekly sanitation surveys, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture provided guidance on appropriate pesticide use in high-risk areas, such as locations with ongoing identification of dengue cases, despite other interventions, and those with significant mosquito insecticide resistance. In September 2024, PRDH established an Integrated Vector Management advisory committee with the purpose of providing vector control recommendations to the Secretary of Health. These recommendations included insecticide rotation and periodic evaluation of insecticides to promote use of effective insecticides and limit emergence of insecticide resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Public Outreach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By December 2024, response efforts from PRDH, CDC, and PRVCU had reached approximately 160,000 persons through various educational and community engagement initiatives across Puerto Rico. These efforts included 215 activities in priority communities (i.e., areas with high dengue incidence and a history of dengue outbreaks) aimed at raising awareness about dengue prevention, and 328 activities at educational institutions, where dengue-related training and materials were provided. In addition, 1,624 health fairs and community outreach events were held to engage the broader public, and 108 health care facilities were visited to share information on clinical management and prevention strategies. To further support these interventions, 56,809 educational kits were distributed to residents of and visitors to Puerto Rico, equipping participants with valuable resources to aid in dengue prevention efforts. Campaigns such as “&lt;i&gt;Haz la diferencia y ciérrale la puerta al dengue”&lt;/i&gt; (“Make a difference and close the door to dengue”) were widely promoted across social media&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt; and radio, encouraging residents to actively participate in removing standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs, using mosquito repellents to avoid bites, and installing or repairing screens on doors and windows to prevent mosquito entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the public outreach, PRDH and CDC focused on implementation of vaccination with Dengvaxia in populations for whom its use is recommended. Prevaccination dengue screening was established in three clinical laboratory networks. The number of clinics offering the vaccine increased from six to 23 during 2024. However, because of reduced demand for Dengvaxia in the global market, production of the vaccine has been discontinued by the manufacturer, and available doses will expire in 2026. Currently no other dengue vaccines are approved for use in the United States.**&lt;/p&gt;

However, new research has suggested that the current recommended levels may not be sufficient to prevent cognitive impairment, especially in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study from UC San Francisco, published in Annals of Neurology, found that even older individuals with so-called healthy levels of B12, showed signs of cognitive decline and brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Vitamin B12 is associated with maintaining cognitive health and preventing neurological issues as we get older, there is a need to revise the healthy range as it may not be enough to maintain older people's brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study published in Annals of Neurology, older, healthy volunteers, with low levels of B12, but still in the normal range, displayed signs of neurological and cognitive deficiency. The levels are currently considered healthy but low enough to cause damage to the brain’s white matter – the nerve fibres that enable communication between areas of the brain. The older adults with these levels got test scores associated with slower cognitive and visual processing speeds, compared to those with higher B12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous studies that defined healthy amounts of B12 may have missed subtle functional manifestations of high or low levels that can affect people without causing overt symptoms,” said senior author Ari J. Green, MD, of the UCSF Departments of Neurology and Ophthalmology and the Weill Institute for Neurosciences, noting that clear deficiencies of the vitamin are commonly associated with a type of anemia. “Revisiting the definition of B12 deficiency to incorporate functional biomarkers could lead to earlier intervention and prevention of cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, 231 healthy participants without dementia or mild cognitive impairment with an average age of 71 were involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their Vitamin B12 levels averaged 414.8 pmol/L, which is well above the U.S. minimum of 148 pmol/L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers considered the biologically active component of B12, which provides a clearer picture of how much vitamin the body can utilise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the cognitive test, participants with lower active B12 levels had slower processing speed, which indicated subtle cognitive decline. Its impact was amplified by older age. Such participants also showed significant delays in responding to visual stimuli, which pointed to slower visual processing speeds and sluggish brain conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, MRIs also showed a higher volume of lesions in the white matter of the participants which could be linked with cognitive decline, dementia or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition to redefining B12 deficiency, clinicians should consider supplementation in older patients with neurological symptoms even if their levels are within normal limits,” Co-first author Alexandra Beaudry-Richard, MSc, said. “Ultimately, we need to invest in more research about the underlying biology of B12 insufficiency, since it may be a preventable cause of cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Research finds popular dietary supplement can cause cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 17:54:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>'A stiff breeze could have blown him over' | 9NEWS Investigates: The arrest and death of Jim Purdy - 9News.com KUSA</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiywFBVV95cUxQcVR2V1BYcV9lNXlVa1otVXU1eWtucVduVmdkWEJHLUtpM3ZaNVNYN3ZMSVVEN3J2RjQ4YVo1SFJTYkMyVWZ3TVY3dU0xYVctczBwZ281V2lCdVNXWG50S3BhSUtqLVBsZkg0MlBXc3h1dzhUWEVEZ3RwN1ZSdVZwNUVLdEhES01sNEdJXy1pU1FIaWRJU01Lb0d2RTNzYVI2Zl9iZGUxMGNWZloxT3RNd2txb3Nqd0JyVUl1QlUxYnFlX29FSmtYUU50bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

However, post-vaccination, a few reported some side effects such as fatigue, exercise intolerance, brain fog, tinnitus, and dizziness. A recent study by Yale researchers has delved deep into this little-understood, persistent condition, referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study posted online, the researchers have characterized this condition and also studied the immunological patterns that differentiate those with PVS from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is still in its early stages, and we need to validate these findings,” Akiko Iwasaki, Sterling Professor of Immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine (YSM) and co-senior author of the study published Feb. 19 as a preprint on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.18.25322379v1" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;MedRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; said in a release. “But this is giving us some hope that there may be something that we can use for diagnosis and treatment of PVS down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chronic symptoms of PVS include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;exercise intolerance&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;excessive fatigue&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;brain fog&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Insomnia&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;dizziness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms develop shortly after vaccination, which is within a day or two, and can get more severe in the days that follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s clear that some individuals are experiencing significant challenges after vaccination. Our responsibility as scientists and clinicians is to listen to their experiences, rigorously investigate the underlying causes, and seek ways to help,” Harlan Krumholz, the Harold H. Hines, Jr. Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) at YSM and co-senior author of the study adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed blood samples from people in their Listen to Immune, Symptom, and Treatment Experiences Now (LISTEN) study to understand long COVID and post-vaccine syndrome (PVS). They compared 42 people with PVS symptoms to 22 people without symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found differences in immune cells between the two groups. Those with PVS had lower levels of effector CD4+ T cells and higher levels of TNF-alpha+ CD8 T cells — both are types of white blood cells — among other differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found differences in antibody levels. People with PVS who never had COVID-19 had lower levels of antibodies against the virus's spike protein. This was likely because they received fewer vaccine doses than those without PVS. With fewer shots and no prior infection, their immune systems had less chance to build protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they found that some people with PVS had higher levels of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, even if they had never been infected. Normally, the spike protein stays in the body for only a few days after vaccination, but in some PVS cases, it was still present more than 700 days later. This lingering spike protein has also been linked to long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was surprising, to find spike protein in circulation at such a late time point. We don’t know if the level of spike protein is causing the chronic symptoms, because there were other participants with PVS who didn’t have any measurable spike protein. But it could be one mechanism underlying this syndrome,” Iwasaki noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krumholz further added that PVS might be similar to other infections that lead to chronic symptoms, each through different biological pathways. “One person might develop chronic symptoms due to immune dysregulation, while another experiences lingering effects from viral reactivation. We need to map these different pathways carefully to understand what is happening in each case. This work is just beginning, and further studies are essential to guide diagnosis and treatment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Shakira's Health Crisis: Fans Rally Outside Hospital Following Her Statement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers added that a deeper understanding of PVS is required to make better &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/seeing-the-invisible/does-the-estimate-of-154-million-lives-saved-by-vaccines-since-1974-stack-up/" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, with fewer side effects. “For instance, if we can determine why spike protein is persisting for as long as it is in some people, maybe we can remove it — with monoclonal antibodies, for example — and maybe that could help reduce PVS symptoms,” Iwasaki adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 17:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Yale scientists link Covid vaccines to alarming new syndrome causing 'distinct biological changes - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogJBVV95cUxQYzNCWkJfRGdUM3N3cWNiWDZ4eVk1b09jdUVPU0tHODBuVTJocnJTY1NOQjNDeVVDR1F3dFQtTVFORVRSVTB2akFkWkh1RnRVbjlKUnlRTThXcE5KNVUtU01Bb1VxSmJyVEhkZkY5WHFTaFN5d0Fwc1g4Ymw3cHZGRTF1ZjAwT2VCUUxEYXhaRUFBNXJKUlpQZk1fVEhsZjY2ZEd0Q0lSRXJvTWhwTVI2QTFXVktZdDBWaGtBUl9qWDZiU3cwRzdCNGtSWHY2VDBlUlhQd0doU3BpN3pWTGt6eGlsUW1ibGI4R3BqbzlZR2lRbWJ1QW45UHBYcDhDTV85VXU3QXVkdllEV0tWMjFsbHhDS0NBRm1aSVNxX3RzeXBuUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 vaccines have been crucial in preventing millions of deaths during the pandemic.

This finding is consistent with the expectation that the treatment increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. The paper was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2024.08.009"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="444" data-end="816"&gt;Depression, or major depressive disorder, is one of the most common mental health conditions. It is characterized by persistent sadness, a loss of interest in activities, and emotional or physical symptoms that interfere with daily life. Treatment options include psychotherapy, medication, lifestyle changes, and social support, depending on the severity of the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="818" data-end="1281"&gt;Drugs used to treat depression are called antidepressants. There are several types of antidepressants, each with a different mechanism of action. One frequently used type is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These drugs act on the systems in the brain that use the neurotransmitter serotonin (or 5-HT). It is believed that they increase the availability of serotonin in the brain, although more specific data on the mechanism of action are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="1283" data-end="1738"&gt;Study author Vibeke H. Dam and her colleagues aimed to explore whether the binding of serotonin to 5-HT4 receptors in patients with major depressive disorder is associated with cognitive and depressive symptoms following antidepressant treatment. They hypothesized that treatment with SSRIs would reduce the binding of serotonin to these receptors in the brain and that this change would be accompanied by changes in depressive symptoms and verbal memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="1740" data-end="2112"&gt;The study included 100 participants who had not previously been treated with antidepressants. They were recruited from the mental health system in the capital region of Denmark and enrolled in the NeuroPharm depression study, an open, nonrandomized 12-week clinical trial. Participants were between 18 and 65 years old and exhibited moderate or severe depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2114" data-end="2687"&gt;Participants were assigned to take escitalopram, an SSRI, for 12 weeks, starting at doses of 10 to 20 mg/day. The initial dose was adjusted by clinicians as necessary. At the start of treatment, participants underwent positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of their brains. These scans were repeated after eight weeks of treatment. Participants also completed a series of cognitive tests at the start of the study and after 12 weeks. Because many participants dropped out of the study, complete data were collected from only 39 individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2689" data-end="2944"&gt;Results showed that the initial level of 5-HT4 receptor binding activity in the neocortex, neostriatum, and hippocampus was not associated with the participants’ response to antidepressant treatment (i.e., whether their symptoms improved and by how much).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="2946" data-end="3302"&gt;However, 5-HT4 receptor binding activity decreased by 9% during the eight weeks of treatment in the neostriatum. There were no changes in 5-HT4 receptor binding activity in the neocortex or hippocampus. Interestingly, participants who experienced the smallest decrease in 5-HT4 receptor binding activity tended to show larger improvements in verbal memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="3304" data-end="3571"&gt;The neostriatum is part of the basal ganglia and plays a role in mood regulation through its connections with the prefrontal cortex and the limbic system. Dysfunctions in this region are linked to mood disorders such as major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Initiation of antidepressant SSRI/SNRI [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors / serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors] treatment of otherwise untreated patients with MDD [major depressive disorder] induces a reduction in cerebral 5- HT4Rs that is consistent with increases in synaptic extracellular 5-HT [serotonin] independent of overall clinical response. However, the less it was reduced, the better patients performed on verbal memory tasks,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="4065" data-end="4480"&gt;The study contributes to the scientific understanding of the mechanisms of action of antidepressants. However, it should be noted that the study design does not allow for any causal inferences to be made. Because the study did not include a control group or any other type of control, it cannot be definitively concluded that the observed reductions in receptor activity were caused solely by the medications used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2024.08.009"&gt;Effect of Antidepressant Treatment on 5-HT4 Receptor Binding and Associations With Clinical Outcomes and Verbal Memory in Major Depressive Disorder,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Vibeke H.

&lt;p&gt;While sex is built into the very definition of an STI, experts caution that it is possible to contract one without getting it on. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/14/health/stds-spike-in-nyc-alarming-health-data-shows-heres-why/"&gt;Sexually transmitted infections&lt;/a&gt; — which &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/php/communication-resources/prevalence-incidence-and-cost-estimates.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;affect 1 in 5 Americans&lt;/a&gt; — are most commonly found on the genitals, anus and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2022/default.htm#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20more%20than%202.5,from%20all%20STI%20prevention%20partners." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, STI rates are on the rise, putting millions of people’s lives at risk from entirely preventable infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sexually transmitted infections — which affect 1 in 5 Americans — are most commonly found on the genitals, anus and mouth. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;fizkes – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“STIs must be a public health priority,” the CDC warned. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health agency noted that “the most alarming concerns” revolve around syphilis cases — which are at the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/31/lifestyle/syphilis-cases-soar-to-highest-level-in-70-years-cdc-sounds-alarm/"&gt;highest level they’ve been in more than seven decades.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Distressingly, syphilis is among the number of STIs you can contract without having intercourse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Yes, it’s possible to get an STI without having penetrative sex. Herpes, syphilis and HPV can all be passed via skin-to-skin contact with an infected area of the body,” &lt;a href="https://www.evvy.com/contributor/olivia-cassano"&gt;Olivia Cassano&lt;/a&gt; of Evvy, a company that offers vaginal health services, including at-home microbiome tests, clinical care and coaching, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;Skin-to-skin transmissions also include sharing bodily fluids through actions like mutual masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cassano noted that in addition to skin-to-skin contact, STIs can be transmitted via oral sex. Specifically, both gonorrhea and chlamydia can infect the throat. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both infections can also infect the eyes, which contain mucous membranes that STIs can easily invade. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bacteria from gonorrhea and chlamydia can infect the eyes through direct contact with semen or vaginal discharge from an infected person — or a person rubs their eyes after touching infected genital areas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another STI eye infection is &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/11/24/health/cluster-of-sexually-transmitted-eye-syphilis-cases-point-to-one-man-cdc/"&gt;ocular syphilis&lt;/a&gt;, which develops when the Treponema&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;pallidum bacterium enters the body, usually through sexual contact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Penetrative sex isn’t the only way to catch an STI, so it’s best to inform yourself and be prepared before any kind of sexual contact,” warned Cassano.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cassano explained that while the vast majority of STIs are transmitted via some form of sexual contact, caution should be used when sharing razors, needles and sex toys. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Roman – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;She urged the orally active to use dental dams as a preventative measure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cassano explained that while the vast majority of STIs are transmitted via some form of sexual contact, caution should be used when using or sharing razors, needles and sex toys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.evvy.com/blog/can-you-get-an-std-without-having-sex" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Evvy&lt;/a&gt;, “Infections like HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C can also be spread through sharing needles or other equipment that comes into contact with infected blood, like during intravenous drug use or through unsterilized tattoo needles.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, Cassano explained that STIs can be transmitted to a baby during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She stressed the importance of consistent condom use for sexually active people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;STI cases are on the rise in the US.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Saiful52 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How to further guard against contracting or spreading an STI? “Have open communication with sexual partners and get regular STI screenings!” she urged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.universaldrugstore.com/health-news/sexual-health-index/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Universal Drugstore&lt;/a&gt;‘s “Sexual Health Index,” certain states are hotspots for STIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mississippi, for one, was ranked as the “worst affected” by &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/20/health/weird-place-you-can-get-an-sti-that-everyone-can-see-revealed/"&gt;sexually transmitted infections&lt;/a&gt;, with one of the highest chlamydia rates in the nation of 700 cases per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HIV is most prevalent in Georgia, with 23.1 cases per 100,000 residents, a figure that is more than double the national average. On the other hand, Minnesota has the fewest HIV cases, with only 4.5 per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

The drug, which is the active ingredient of many pain-relief medications, is one of the few considered safe to take during pregnancy by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings suggest, however, that doctors should reconsider prescribing medications with acetaminophen to mothers during pregnancy, the researchers said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of the prior studies asked women to self-report whether they had taken Tylenol or anything that contained acetaminophen,” said lead author &lt;a href="https://www.seattlechildrens.org/directory/brennan-baker/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brennan Baker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at Seattle Children’s Research Institute. Baker also works in the lab of Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.peds.uw.edu/directory/sheela_sathyanarayana/1330" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sheela Sathyanarayana&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a UW Medicine pediatrician.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This medication was also approved decades ago, and may need reevaluation by the FDA,” said Sathyanarayana, the paper’s senior author.  “Acetaminophen was never evaluated for fetal exposures in relations to long-term neurodevelopmental impacts.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen is widely used during pregnancy, with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7192766/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;41–70% of pregnant individuals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, Europe and Asia reporting use. Despite acetaminophen’s classification as low risk by regulatory agencies such as the FDA, accumulating evidence suggests a potential link between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, including ADHD and ADHD autism spectrum disorder, the researchers noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research tracked a cohort of 307 women from 2006 to 2011, who agreed to give blood samples during their pregnancy.  The researchers tracked plasma biomarkers for acetaminophen in the samples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The children born to these mothers were followed for 8 to 10 years. Among the women who did not use acetaminophen during pregnancy, the rate of ADHD was 9%, but for the women who used acetaminophen, the ADHD rate among their offspring was 18%.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen metabolites were detected in 20.2% of maternal plasma samples. Children whose mothers had these biomarkers present in their plasma had a 3.15 times higher likelihood of an ADHD diagnosis compared with those without detected exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association was stronger among daughters than sons, with the daughters of acetaminophen-exposed mothers showing a 6.16 times higher likelihood of ADHD while the association was weaker and nonsignificant in males. Researchers did not know why the association was stronger in females.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investigators’ analysis used data from the Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Learning in Early Childhood (CANDLE) &lt;a href="https://candlestudy.uthsc.edu/what-candle/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;research cohort&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which comprised 1,031 pregnant individuals in Memphis, Tenn., who were enrolled between 2006 and 2011.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By happenstance, and not by design, the study cohort included only Black women, Baker said, adding that the results could be generalized to woman and children of any race or ethnicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mothers often are advised to turn to acetaminophen, the primary agent in Tylenol, rather than ibuprofen, which is more likely to adversely affect the fetal kidney or heart, Baker said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(Acetaminophen) is really the only option to control fever or pain during pregnancy,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what is a mother to do? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is obviously more work that needs to be done in this area,” he said. “And we need to continually update our guidance.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, he suggested, during prenatal visits, patients should discuss the dosage of a drug that contains acetaminophen or talk about what pain it is intended to help manage, he said. Another drug class, such as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554507/#:~:text=Triptans%20comprise%20a%20class%20of,lasting%20at%20least%204%20hours." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;triptans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; is safe and effective for managing migraines, he added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More work needs to be done to find out if some people can tolerate acetaminophen during pregnancy with no ill effects on the fetus while others cannot, he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that research findings on the effects of the drug and its potential risks during pregnancy have not been consistent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recently released in Sweden, showed no link between maternal acetaminophen use and ADHD in their children; while another &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/42/6/1702/739709" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; out of Norway, did in fact find a link. The study out of Sweden, however, relied on self-reported data, Baker noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study out of Sweden, however, reported that only 7% of pregnant individuals used acetaminophen,” Baker noted. “And that study could have underestimated the exposure.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it goes back to how the data was collected,” he added. “The conflicting results means that more research is needed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical societies and the FDA should update guidance on the use of acetaminophen as safety data emerges, Sathyanarayana said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health (UG3UH3OD023271). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>UW Medicine Newsroom</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 17:09:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPTDRrTnVZdHBVUk9PaUF6YmFOY0thOHBCNXJsZ1FFUldjZ1dCMTRNWmY5Q1V4X0ZlUExrT21HRXBEMHV6NzVFd21mX3RDOEdmMlRlUHJrOC1WcG5ZX2Z4aW5iRTJkWWVTa05XZ1lXX2hHUGlJWUxucUZGbUpoc2M5VkZoQmpxNnVVNlFUZmtPWkdudUZMMEdj</guid></item><item><title>This is the best time to go to bed to stay healthy as you age - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxNdHVmWW9Ga0JlQ0xTSmkzM2tlb3NkajZINGkzTzdzTWd0NjhuT0Y4elNxMmtBU1VzZ3JBMi16MURScGZ1NlpRbUVBOEFranFyN2JJemtlU3NoSUNGOWRUNWhWZXV1LU9OSGZuVVBOamRyT0ZxUnhBQ3pLT0xYRlQ2NXF3VXFjUGU5Z1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/stages-of-sleep/deep-sleep"&gt;Sleep Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the ideal amount of deep sleep is 1.4-2 hours, or 20-25 per cent of our overall sleep. However, the amount a person gets can vary depending on factors including age, genetics and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most sleep cycles last between one and two hours, and if we lose even half an hour of sleep, we might lose the deep sleep part which is vital for the brain’s cleaning,” says Dr Sabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Deep sleep ‘washes out’ brain toxins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although scientists have long known about the restorative properties of sleep, it was in 2013 that a team from the University of Rochester Medical Centre in the US identified a system in the brain akin to a dishwasher’s rinse cycle, which is activated during sleep. They found a series of tiny channels surrounding the brain’s blood vessels that allow pulses of cerebrospinal fluid to wash in and be pushed through the brain tissue. As it leaves, it carries the day’s metabolic waste with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They named it the glymphatic system because of its similarity to the body’s lymphatic network, except managed by the glial cells, which support the brain’s neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain isn’t like other organ systems, such as the liver, where cells regenerate – our neuron levels aren’t replenished,” says Dr Ahmad Khundakar, a senior lecturer in biomedical science at Teesside University, whose specialism is dementia and neuroscience. “Because of that, if proteins build up, they can eventually cause neurodegeneration. The glymphatic system is very important as a clearance mechanism to flush out these proteins.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In turn, brain changes associated with dementia also &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5910033/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;disturb sleep&lt;/a&gt;, disrupting the synchronised brain waves which happen during deep sleep – a vicious cycle, which prevents the glymphatic system working properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people with Alzheimer’s, abnormal levels of beta-amyloid protein clump together to form plaques. Tau protein also accumulates and begins sticking together in tangles. These harm the communication between neurons, eventually causing them to die off and the brain to shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another protein, alpha-synuclein, is naturally abundant in our brains but in many people with Parkinson’s, it clumps together in masses called Lewy bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Often, we see a combination of different protein build-ups in the brains of people with dementia,” he says. “It’s very rare that you get pure Alzheimer’s or pure Parkinson’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why do we get less deep sleep as we age?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies and children have a large amount of slow wave sleep, before this begins to decline from early adulthood onwards. As we age, we begin to have relatively short periods of slow-wave sleep and fewer of them, making our sleep lighter and more fragmented. Although the reason is not yet fully understood, it is thought to be due to the lower levels of growth hormone and melatonin our bodies produce. “Our circadian rhythm is disrupted as we grow older, and that deeper sleep is harder to reach,” says Dr Sabia.&lt;/p&gt;

Interest in alternative births has also been tied to mistrust in the mainstream U.S. healthcare system due to factors like an increase in c-sections, disproportionate rates of non-white maternal deaths in hospitals, and implicit bias in medical care.

There’s also triple the risk of neonatal seizures or serious neurologic dysfunction. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Midwives have been around for centuries for a reason,” Rankins said. “Having someone present who understands birth and can address potential problems is lifesaving.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rankins noted that having a midwife attend to a home birth is essential. She partners with midwives in her community to provide a safe place for transfer to the hospital when needed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennis shared that she has personally witnessed devastating outcomes from freebirths and is concerned that social media has glamorized the trend, causing some people to forgo medical resources that they could have otherwise accessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I understand and appreciate that there is mistrust in medicine … but there are ways to have an unmedicated, natural experience while still having medical support to ensure a safer and better outcome for you and the baby,” Dennis said. “If someone is considering a freebirth, I would encourage them to really ask themselves why and explore deeply what they are trying to gain … and see if there are ways that it can be accomplished by still being supported by someone who is licensed to practice medicine.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lotus Birth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like freebirth, lotus birth appeals to those who seek natural experiences. A lotus birth involves leaving the baby attached to the umbilical cord and placenta until they fall off, which can take as few as &lt;a href="https://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/Pediatrics/LotusBirthHandout.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="five days and up to 15 days" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/Pediatrics/LotusBirthHandout.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;five days and up to 15 days&lt;/a&gt;.

It is typically treated with anti-nausea prescription medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dennis pointed out that it would be unethical to clinically test cannabis use during pregnancy, but collected case reports have demonstrated the outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have found historically, and continue to find now, that there are higher numbers of people who have early pregnancy exposure to marijuana, that there is no safe level,” Dennis said. “It does increase the rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including smaller birth weight.

Interest in alternative births has also been tied to mistrust in the mainstream U.S. healthcare system due to factors like an increase in c-sections, disproportionate rates of non-white maternal deaths in hospitals, and implicit bias in medical care.

There’s also triple the risk of neonatal seizures or serious neurologic dysfunction. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Midwives have been around for centuries for a reason,” Rankins said. “Having someone present who understands birth and can address potential problems is lifesaving.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rankins noted that having a midwife attend to a home birth is essential. She partners with midwives in her community to provide a safe place for transfer to the hospital when needed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennis shared that she has personally witnessed devastating outcomes from freebirths and is concerned that social media has glamorized the trend, causing some people to forgo medical resources that they could have otherwise accessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I understand and appreciate that there is mistrust in medicine … but there are ways to have an unmedicated, natural experience while still having medical support to ensure a safer and better outcome for you and the baby,” Dennis said. “If someone is considering a freebirth, I would encourage them to really ask themselves why and explore deeply what they are trying to gain … and see if there are ways that it can be accomplished by still being supported by someone who is licensed to practice medicine.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lotus Birth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like freebirth, lotus birth appeals to those who seek natural experiences. A lotus birth involves leaving the baby attached to the umbilical cord and placenta until they fall off, which can take as few as &lt;a href="https://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/Pediatrics/LotusBirthHandout.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="five days and up to 15 days" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/Pediatrics/LotusBirthHandout.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;five days and up to 15 days&lt;/a&gt;. The placenta is typically covered with salt and herbs to minimize odor and is carried close to the baby in a bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACOG and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have not taken a position on lotus birth, and the practice has not been fully studied. However, the AAP released Nolt’s report in its journal, Pediatrics&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;to help physicians understand the practice and treat patients who may have been involved in a lotus birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In our research, the impetus for lotus birth … is the idea that there is a spiritual connection of the placenta to the baby and that there needs to be a nonviolent separation of those two entities,” Nolt said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This spiritual connection is hard to prove or disprove, and Nolt said that medical professionals are expected to follow proven practices. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We as physicians try to think more about what science there is and risk/benefit to the baby,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The report found no evidence-based benefit to babies with lotus birth. Risks include infection from the dead tissue, tearing of the umbilical cord and jaundice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proponents of lotus birth have noted the advantages of extra blood flowing from the placenta to the baby, but the same outcome can be achieved by delayed clamping of the umbilical cord, a standard practice when there is no distress. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cannabis For Morning Sickness &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cannabis has been used to ease nausea for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/jcge/abstract/2022/04000/the_effectiveness_of_common_cannabis_products_for.8.aspx" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="thousands of years" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://journals.lww.com/jcge/abstract/2022/04000/the_effectiveness_of_common_cannabis_products_for.8.aspx" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;thousands of years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so&lt;span&gt; it’s not entirely surprising that people have tried it to treat morning sickness — but physicians warn against it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite this, a recent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20240829/surprising-number-of-women-using-marijuana-during-pregnancy" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="analysis" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.webmd.com/baby/news/20240829/surprising-number-of-women-using-marijuana-during-pregnancy" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;&lt;span&gt;analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; examined 90,000 umbilical cords sampled from 2019-2023 and found that 20% tested positive for cannabis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum and was so miserable that I probably would have tried almost anything to feel better, but I’ll tell you, that would not have included marijuana,” Dennis said. “That’s because there is no demonstrated safe level of marijuana in pregnancy.” Hyperemesis gravidarum is a rare form of morning sickness that causes persistent vomiting that can lead to dehydration and other medical issues. It is typically treated with anti-nausea prescription medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dennis pointed out that it would be unethical to clinically test cannabis use during pregnancy, but collected case reports have demonstrated the outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have found historically, and continue to find now, that there are higher numbers of people who have early pregnancy exposure to marijuana, that there is no safe level,” Dennis said. “It does increase the rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including smaller birth weight. Depending on how much someone is using and how long they are using throughout pregnancy, there can be withdrawal in newborns.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis use during pregnancy has also been tied to abnormal brain development and other &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cannabis/health-effects/pregnancy.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="complications" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67b2aafee4b0e4f05163c24b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/cannabis/health-effects/pregnancy.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;complications&lt;/a&gt;, but more research is needed.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The condition, known as an 'eye stroke', occurs when the vessels supplying blood to the optic nerve become blocked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, they &lt;span&gt;said while the exact cause was unclear, the rapid drop in blood sugar caused by the drug could &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14304681/ozempic-patient-effects-weight-loss-study-exposes-risk.html"&gt;damage blood vessels in the eyes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is because the sudden change in pressure can cause fluid to leak out of delicate blood vessels in the retina, leading to swelling and damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around half a million people in the UK and some 15million in the US are now thought to be using the jabs, which can help them lose up to 20 per cent of their bodyweight in just a few months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, the researchers from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, found of the 37 million adults, there were 166,932 patients on type 2 diabetes drugs, including semaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2024.6555?guestAccessKey=9cc7cefb-e963-490d-bbd1-8ad419a0b542&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=022025"&gt;JAMA Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers said: 'We observed an increased NAION risk with semaglutide exposure relative to non-exposure.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They also observed an 'increased risk' among those on semaglutide compared to 'users of non–GLP-1 drugs empagliflozin and sitagliptin,' they added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They added: 'In the absence of a known mechanism for this association, we urge clinicians to weigh the concern for an increased risk of a rare but potentially blinding eye condition with the many therapeutic benefits of semaglutide.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are currently no treatments for NAION or an 'eye stroke', which affects around one in 10,000 people, and vision often does not improve. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike other strokes caused by a loss of blood supply, there is no weakness, numbness or loss of speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People typically suffer sudden vision loss in one eye, without any pain, and patients often notice the issue on waking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as a separate study &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2829326"&gt;published in the same medical journal&lt;/a&gt; last month suggested that the drugs may trigger debilitating vision issues including NAION. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14380795/ozempic-patients-blind-doctors-effect.html"&gt;noted this was likely due&lt;/a&gt; to the fact the jabs rapidly lower blood sugar levels which could damage blood vessels in the eyes — not that the injections themselves were 'toxic'.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report detailed the cases of nine adults, aged 57 on average, who took either  semaglutide or tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seven were later diagnosed with NAION. But most noticed their vision improving within days or weeks of stopping the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the report, one &lt;span&gt;woman in her 50s developed NAION the day after her first semaglutide injection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She woke up the morning after the injection with 'painful vision loss' in her left eye. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests revealed swelling in her optic nerve and damaged blood vessels in her retina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman stopped taking semaglutide and her insulin, with follow-up appointments confirming her vision returned to normal two months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, t&lt;span&gt;wo weeks after restarting semaglutide to control her diabetes, the vision loss returned. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She was diagnosed with severe optic nerve swelling, and her vision returned to normal seven months later. &lt;/span&gt;It was unclear if she stopped semaglutide a second time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials in Denmark, where Ozempic manufacturer Novo Nordisk is based, are also currently &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14205789/officials-ozempic-cause-blinding-eye-disease-Denmark-EU.html"&gt;investigating the links between semaglutide and vision loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like any medication, the jabs are known to cause side effects that vary in both frequency and severity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other reported problems include constipation, fatigue, stomach pain, headaches and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bizarre symptoms, such as hair loss, have also been reported among some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have also long told how they are treating increasing numbers of slim women who end up in hospital after falsely telling online chemists they are overweight to pass eligibility checks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under official guidelines, only patients who have a body mass index (BMI) of over 35 and at least one weight-related health problem like high blood pressure, or those who have a BMI of 30 to 34.9 and meet the criteria for referral to a specialist weight management service, should be prescribed Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, law forbids the sale of such drugs without a prescription from a medical professional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In December, advertising officials issued a warning to advertisers, businesses and influencers to remove online and social media ads for weight-loss prescription-only medicines targeted at members of the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This followed a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14083761/social-media-influencers-thousands-prescription-Mounjaro-jabs.html"&gt;MailOnline investigation&lt;/a&gt; that found social media influencers were being encouraged to illegally promote prescription weight-loss jabs to their thousands of&lt;span&gt; followers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 16:11:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQanZPUzJ6VUVXWmdieVE4emJMZWxYclNOS3RhenBvLUVoTFllRVNtM2QwWHUwMHF5ck4ydFJMQ3pKNUFadlpNX1ZoeGlTUFZzT08tMWRjU2xlbWxBRFk1c1duVzZwRnFxbE5aUDl2d2diN1BySHByS0R2WlczVUtTcGdGXy16NzJYMmZ6RkhGbkQ4QXFaZ3N5X1FzQWlEeUkyblE3djhPdUlPWktRcHJ1dnZkWnViS0pEOWpj0gHAAUFVX3lxTE5xWmd3OUJReE9JOFFJTGZ0Tmh3RXJvY2g4R01fY0g4bHlXQ0JaUHBfc0RON0Q3VHYxZ3JMSWJLU2ZmQXU5U2FwMGhVT3ZXX3h1Zm1LNUNENlVaRHp5VVpXZlJ4clRLSkVuMkVpNzBMbW91cEtJT3RDMTJ0bWhKZmJUcE5UTURwT2tOVDhuSmJrQkJ0YjhBWWNWX3Rnc2Ntcms1bVNrT3UzRXh4RUE2Y2ZrXzVPWXlpRmYwVnlPRVFTTw</guid></item><item><title>Study: Bird Flu May Spread Through the Air - Newsmax</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOMzJ0cGRVSWN3bC1DYXhMLUZYVmRhY3pXN0ZaaXNzVXlJbUJER2NiblQ3XzEwZTNYZ1l2UzZNY1d1YzZXQXpfdDk1ZjhHSlVpMlVQZHpNMVlIQ1FqZEFZZ1liekluTy13YndJeXh6eUk2YXktNzBsSlNZSU1aLXpqNDdrLS1CYXVGMGVqUElWb9IBlAFBVV95cUxPaFNFMGE4ZzZrZEVNMnJfVmIwaTNzRG93bFBpRmdLdE4xYzlNWXo1cEJZcUtRbXdfUHpkQkt2bUkzVzdMRFhHUWxmNlluX2NWWHFuS0Qzc2oyWExCUnpHUmllZmxBVTlqMkVYRWVweEtIWHg2U2xxVmp0czN1dm45MEJoaDhaMFJ6MTdZcnJOM1NBZEY5?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mainArticleDiv" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;The highly contagious H5N1 bird flu virus may be spreading through the air under certain conditions, according to a new study from the Czech Republic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government veterinarians made the discovery while investigating a mysterious outbreak at a highly secured chicken farm last February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The farm had strict biosecurity measures — filtered well water, one-way airflow fans and fencing to keep wild animals out. Yet, the virus still infected the flock, causing thousands of bird deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likely culprit? Wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kamil Sedlak, senior study author and director of the State Veterinary Institute in Prague, said that after all the possibilities were explored, windborne spread was most likely cause in this case, CNN reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts traced the virus back to a duck farm nearly 5 miles west of the chicken facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The duck farm, near a lake that hosted wildlife, had far less biosecurity and had been hit by a massive outbreak days earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bird flu swept through the duck farm rapidly —  800 ducks died on the first day. Within two days, 5,000 had died. A few days later, the entire 50,000-bird flock was culled to contain the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the chickens at the breeding facility became sick slowly. Birds near air intake vents were the first to die, suggesting they were exposed to virus particles carried by the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers checked the weather data from that week, which revealed perfect conditions for windborne spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a steady breeze from west to east (from the duck farm to the chicken farm). There was also a lot of cloud cover, which blocked UV light that usually kills viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more, there were cooler temperatures —between 40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit, which is ideal for virus survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think that under certain specific conditions, the spread of the avian influenza virus by wind can occur,” Sedlak told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings, which were published on the preprint server bioRxiv, should be considered preliminary until they are peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Center for Influenza Ecology, said windborne spread has been suspected before but is hard to prove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The whole idea of potentially being sort of wind-driven has been out there for a while,” Webby, who was not involved in the study, told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He noted that the current strains of bird flu circulating in animals don’t easily infect people and would likely need to mutate more to become a serious human threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s very low-risk for humans to be infected with the virus like that, but I think it happens,” Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Osterholm also warned that wind-driven spread might explain unusual cases, such as the three veterinarians who tested positive for H5N1 antibodies after attending a conference, despite having no direct contact with sick animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not only how much virus is blowing out into the air but also where it lands, said Dr. Montserrat Torremorell, professor and chair of Veterinary Population Medicine at the University of Minnesota, who reviewed the findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Torremorell recommended farms consider filtering the air in barns, in addition to following current precautions such as personal protective equipment and restricted access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think the airborne transmission should be on the table,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;


                    

                    
                &lt;/div&gt;

Shah said.

This is especially true if they are &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK558960/"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt;, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KPC7OEJV4VAW3ARXJZVD2NERAA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Both estrogen and testosterone interact with the immune system in ways that are not yet fully understood. But generally, experts said, higher levels of estrogen may be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4226184/#:~:text=Estrogens%20influence%20immune%20and%20inflammatory,pregnancy%2C%20and%20menopause%20%5B9%2C"&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-020-01998-9"&gt;chronic&lt;/a&gt;, longer-term &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02279/full"&gt;immune responses&lt;/a&gt;, which may help explain why women are &lt;a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/178722"&gt;almost twice as likely&lt;/a&gt; as men to be diagnosed with an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ENWQGGVQMVC7FAKU7U7XF5CM6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Shah cautioned that further study is needed on the role of hormone levels in the development of long covid, though hormones may not completely explain the long covid risk among some women. It probably is a combined effect of age, pregnancy and menopause, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ORKIQUYGFVHW7NTLJWTT2G3AHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study found that women ages 55 and older — who would be menopausal — had a 34 percent higher risk of developing long covid than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OX2VC3UIYNHOLIBLHRUSCWRRII" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Shah also said that other factors, such as preexisting differences between men and women in their rate of having autoimmune diseases and other comorbidities, could be playing a role, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U2N2PEXVHFHXRG4YP674UNZBB4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/akiko-iwasaki/"&gt;Akiko Iwasaki&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of immunobiology at the Yale School of Medicine, said the findings suggest that hormones play a key role in long covid, and hormone-replacement treatments may be beneficial for long-covid patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="63CUQUIWJNF6TERO565GTRVSEY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Anecdotally, she said some of her long-covid patients have seen their symptoms improve while taking low-dose testosterone treatments.

Her &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.18.599612v1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; indicates that while women who developed long covid tended to have a normal-looking immune system response to kill the coronavirus, they then experienced increased inflammation, even after the virus is gone — compared with women who recovered, who were able to resolve this inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QCKM44AQ7ZHMHEY64TO5ALHSXQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Women with long covid also had increased levels of a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/02/01/why-women-have-more-autoimmune-diseases/"&gt;gene that is associated with autoimmune disease, called Xist&lt;/a&gt;, compared with women who did not develop long covid, Blish said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5KQ6G3JZQ5BCLMJ67K4DMQ6L24" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In contrast, Blish said, men with long covid appear to have a harder time killing off the coronavirus in the first place, which suggests that their symptoms may be a result of a more persistent infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ENIDNKUKQ5EHBPKPUPWG3JH3KI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Both of these immune system responses need to be studied further, she said, but these results suggest that the prevention and treatment of long covid in men and women could vary significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WOD4LQ5UARFZHO3O3RMZFGERKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Even if they end up in the same place, the underlying drivers of disease can be quite different,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FRMPTGEU2RH3JBDPXMZ2V7RRIY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One limitation of the RECOVER study is that it did not include data about participants’ hormone levels, menstrual cycles, pregnancies or use of hormone-related medications such as birth control. However, Shah said, the study did collect biological specimens from participants that she hopes to use in research to analyze their hormone levels throughout their coronavirus infection and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NUGZBSRJZJGVXITYPUB6FHRQWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the meantime, she hopes that the results of her recent study could help validate women’s experiences with the disease.

He was also given medication to help with gout, a type of arthritis and the condition he was attempting to treat with the extreme eating plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A year after quitting the diet, the medics reported their patient remained kidney stone free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the case they said it highlighted the potential risks a carnivore diet posed for kidney stone formation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This patient’s urine studies demonstrate the potential hazards of the carnivore diet,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Due to increased animal protein, the exclusion of dairy products, and the removal of fruits and vegetables, the diet creates an optimal environment for the development of all stone types.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added: 'The lack of literature on this and other fad diets’ safety and efficacy should be a cause for alarm among physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The advent of social media and the use of such communication for health information will make fad diets a continually growing issue.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medics said a wealth of evidence showed eating too much meat contributed to kidney stones by increasing levels of uric acid in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 'acidic environment' helps the waste products to crystallise, they wrote. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

carnivores, helped feed bacteria in the guts that could hinder the formation of kidney stones. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kidney stones are considered a relatively common ailment, affecting about in 10 people in the UK.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They are more likely to develop in men than women and are typically diagnosed in patients between the age of 30 and 60.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many kidney stones are passed through urine without patients noticing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If they do cause pain, they are usually easily treated via either medication or a number of different procedures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

STONES? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidney stones are hard lumps that form due to a build up of waste products in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are usually found in the kidney or the ureter — the tube that connects the kidneys to your bladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They can be extremely painful and can lead to kidney infections or the kidney not working properly if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A tenth of Britons and Americans suffer kidney stones, with 30 to 60-year-olds most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is more likely to happen if a person doesn't drink enough fluids, takes certain medication or has an underlying condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those in severe pain, with a high temperature or have blood in their urine should contact their GP or NHS 111 immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once a kidney stone has formed, the body will tries to pass it through urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most are small enough to do so and can be managed at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, larger stones may need to be broken up with surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Up to half of all sufferers will have kidney stones again within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

University School of Medicine have now warned the diet could lead to increased risk of agonising kidney stones — stone-like lumps in the organ that form from excess waste products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, large stones block the flow of urine out of the body, leading to potentially life-threatening infections and risking &lt;a target="_self"

href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916524014199"&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, they stated that the 68 year-old man lost two-stone while only eating meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, tests performed a year after he began his diet revealed that his body was in the earliest stages of forming the painful

awash with accounts hyping the carnivore diet, which sees proponents mainly or only consume animal-based foods like steak, eggs and butter. Pictured Brian Johnson, better known as the Liver King, who has built a following from his raw carnivore diet, mainly filled with meat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One particularity harrowing case saw a man on carnivore diet suffer cholesterol levels so high that it started to leak out of his hands &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analysis revealed he had an increased risk of all three types of major kidney stones, those formed of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and uric acid, and these were now at 'levels consistent with stone growth'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medics said they eventually convinced him to ditch the carnivore diet. He was also given medication to help with gout, a type of arthritis and the condition he was attempting to treat with the extreme eating plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A year after quitting the diet, the medics reported their patient remained kidney stone free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the case they said it highlighted the potential risks a carnivore diet posed for kidney stone formation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This patient’s urine studies demonstrate the potential hazards of the carnivore diet,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Due to increased animal protein, the exclusion of dairy products, and the removal of fruits and vegetables, the diet creates an optimal environment for the development of all stone types.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added: 'The lack of literature on this and other fad diets’ safety and efficacy should be a cause for alarm among physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The advent of social media and the use of such communication for health information will make fad diets a continually growing issue.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medics said a wealth of evidence showed eating too much meat contributed to kidney stones by increasing levels of uric acid in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 'acidic environment' helps the waste products to crystallise, they wrote. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

Women between the ages of 40 and 54 who were not yet menopausal were at the highest risk and were 45 percent more likely to develop long covid than men of the same age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/#/bundle/postmost?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=YAHOO&amp;amp;initiative=feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, among women ages 40 to 54 who had already experienced menopause and women ages 18 to 39, there was no significant difference in long-covid risk compared to men in the same age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This suggests that hormones involved in menopause, fertility and pregnancy may play a role, and may be protective factors against long covid, said Dimpy Shah, an assistant professor of population health sciences with the Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long School of Medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Higher estrogen levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;During menopause, estrogen levels in women tend to drop. Shah said. And while adult women under the age of 40 have high levels of estrogen, they also tend to have higher levels of progesterone, a hormone that helps to balance and regulate estrogen in the body, she said. This is especially true if they are pregnant, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both estrogen and testosterone interact with the immune system in ways that are not yet fully understood. But generally, experts said, higher levels of estrogen may be associated with chronic, longer-term immune responses, which may help explain why women are almost twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shah cautioned that further study is needed on the role of hormone levels in the development of long covid, though hormones may not completely explain the long covid risk among some women. It probably is a combined effect of age, pregnancy and menopause, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study found that women ages 55 and older - who would be menopausal - had a 34 percent higher risk of developing long covid than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shah also said that other factors, such as preexisting differences between men and women in their rate of having autoimmune diseases and other comorbidities, could be playing a role, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology at the Yale School of Medicine, said the findings suggest that hormones play a key role in long covid, and hormone-replacement treatments may be beneficial for long-covid patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Anecdotally, she said some of her long-covid patients have seen their symptoms improve while taking low-dose testosterone treatments. In women, testosterone helps to regulate the immune system and prevent it from being overactive, she explained, so testosterone therapy could be helping to reduce their inflammation and autoimmune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Different symptoms among men and women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The RECOVER study also noted that men and women with long covid experienced different types of symptoms, which, Iwasaki said, mirrored the results of her own research and suggests that in some cases, long covid in men and women may actually be different yet related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When I first saw the study, I thought, ‘Wow, a lot of the differences they’re seeing are exactly what we see in our work,’” she said. “This is revealing more subsets of long covid that may be triggered by different causes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her research suggests that men with long covid are more likely to experience sexual dysfunction, whereas women are more likely to experience hair loss, gastrointestinal symptoms, dry eyes, and a loss of smell and taste. Women with long covid had a greater number of more severe symptoms then men, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Comparing long covid in men vs. women is a useful way to understand the disease because there can be such “dramatic differences” in the immune system responses between the two, said Catherine Blish, an immunologist and a professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Women’s experience of an autoimmune response&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Women with long covid seem to experience more of an autoimmune response, Blish explained. Her research indicates that while women who developed long covid tended to have a normal-looking immune system response to kill the coronavirus, they then experienced increased inflammation, even after the virus is gone - compared with women who recovered, who were able to resolve this inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Women with long covid also had increased levels of a gene that is associated with autoimmune disease, called Xist, compared with women who did not develop long covid, Blish said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In contrast, Blish said, men with long covid appear to have a harder time killing off the coronavirus in the first place, which suggests that their symptoms may be a result of a more persistent infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both of these immune system responses need to be studied further, she said, but these results suggest that the prevention and treatment of long covid in men and women could vary significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Even if they end up in the same place, the underlying drivers of disease can be quite different,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One limitation of the RECOVER study is that it did not include data about participants’ hormone levels, menstrual cycles, pregnancies or use of hormone-related medications such as birth control. However, Shah said, the study did collect biological specimens from participants that she hopes to use in research to analyze their hormone levels throughout their coronavirus infection and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the meantime, she hopes that the results of her recent study could help validate women’s experiences with the disease.

But the U.S. hasn't contributed its information on what's spreading there since January, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For seasonal influenza, which forced schools to shut down in some American states earlier this month, the data isn't being shared, Dr. Wenqing Zhang, head of the WHO's global influenza program, told journalists in a webinar on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) normally participate in global discussions hosted by WHO on influenza vaccinations twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed seasonal flu information is important to monitor outbreaks globally and to inform which influenza strains should be included in vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere's following winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since 20th January, CDC has not yet reported into the WHO platform of Flunet and FluID," Zhang said, referring to two databases for influenza surveillance. As of last week, the U.S. was publicly releasing some flu information nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, he called for his country to leave WHO, starting in January 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="imageMedia image full"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;Former World Health Organization assistant director-general for health security Keiji Fukuda has also worked at the U.S. CDC and attended WHO's influenza vaccine meetings.  (Alain Grosclaude/AFP/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A WHO meeting is scheduled for next week in London to discuss the composition of influenza vaccines. So far, WHO says the U.S. has not indicated whether it will attend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, participants look at the data to come to a consensus on if the strains in the previous seasonal vaccine are still thought to work or if they need to be updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kanta Subbarao says the U.S. also contributes expertise on vaccine effectiveness and key material used by vaccine manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subbarao, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist and influenza scientist now working at Laval University in Quebec City, served as director of WHO's Collaborating Centre for Influenza in Melbourne, Australia. It is one of five such centres for human influenza along with the U.S. CDC in Atlanta, England, China and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH | ERs under pressure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="mediaEmbed"&gt;&lt;div class="player-placeholder-ui-container " data-cy="player-placeholder-ui-container"&gt;&lt;div class="player-placeholder-video-ui" title="Flu cases usually wind down this time of year.

Quebec alone saw 4,600 cases last week, with some ending up in the ICU.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this is a very bad time for the flu vaccine," Subbarao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The CDC and FDA are very actively involved normally in this process, so it's a little hard for me to fathom what it will look like without them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subbarao said the U.S. collaborating centre often receives influenza viruses from Canada and other parts of the Americas as well as Africa and parts of Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC, the FDA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment from CBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;U.S. makes a 'big difference'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Keiji Fukuda, a physician and epidemiologist who has attended influenza vaccine meetings and worked for both WHO and CDC, said it's crucial for U.S. experts to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="imageMedia image full"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image-caption"&gt;U.S. participation is important to be able to accurately predict which influenza strains are going to be circulating in Canada, the U.S., Mexico and other countries in the Northern Hemisphere, virologists say. (Lou Benoist/AFP/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The interpretation of that data is so important," Fukuda said in an interview. "Hearing your peers discuss how they're looking at it may change how you look at it and these kinds of interactions are how we come up with the best formulations for vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. participation is crucial to be able to accurately predict which influenza strains are going to be circulating in Canada, the U.S., and Mexico, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist and principal research scientist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization in Saskatoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because the United States is so geographically large, because it is so populous, it really does make a big difference to know which of those influenza strains … are the ones that are going to be predominant and essentially win the race against the other influenza viruses," said Rasmussen. She studies a range of viral pathogens, including flu, and isn't participating in WHO's influenza vaccine meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO's influenza surveillance program includes about 130 member states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC released weekly seasonal flu information on Feb. 14, as well as an update on cases of H5N1 avian influenza that has infected nearly 70 people in the U.S., including a death. Most of those infections have been among farm workers exposed to infected poultry or cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors and scientists are watching closely to see if H5N1 or another type of influenza virus gains the ability to spread easily from person to person. That's caused previous global flu pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the Canadian government announced the purchase of 500,000 doses of an &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/h5n1-vaccine-canada-1.7462802" target="_blank"&gt;H5N1 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; to help protect those most at risk, such as farm workers and people who handle live avian influenza virus in labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO said its influenza vaccine meeting will continue whether U.S. delegates show up or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:34:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTFA5V09mazhqcXdGV0NaZEM1TFRZellSU2pLUXNNUW5Ed0lnXzZmeUNlUUNJU0JQUDJIcHRzcDB6TU4yel9EX1N0S0ZnZVM1MXJYZm5KT2ZOZXQtTUVxeUhIVk8xSHfSAUdBVV95cUxPYndPRjR3dUhCd3ZTQ21jekY5OHdSYS14OFMwTmRsZHlyTGNqNGtUQTVTajB3T1lBcGtMd3U2RjhybDYyU29aMA</guid></item><item><title>Doctor warns 'early' sign of dementia appears when watching TV - what to look out for - Daily Express US</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxNS0hlR2dwc2VnQnVJQlI4cGFqVlltRlNGS3VmWmdERW1Wb0lTTndObWxxNnZjZzVINWhTb3JQWUVuVm0tWl9rSDdLZ3pJcnB2V3F3bzIxMTQzUjJxQ1hYRlE3WjZpRGd3R3RVNEphejdsYXJBMVhjNUo1X1lqNm5pMGYtbkUyLWtMaDk1U1dkMVJIMFNDQ25hUEI1c2V5Y3NU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dementia expert &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/164100/doctor-warns-early-sign-dementia-appears-watching-tv" target="_blank"&gt;has raised the alarm, cautioning that an "early" indicator of the condition&lt;/a&gt; could surface during a familiar activity such as watching television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tim Rittman, a neurology consultant, highlighted some of the early &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" title="Bruce Willis unrecognizable after health update during LA fires visit" href="/entertainment/celebrity-news/160753/bruce-willis-unrecognizable-steps-out-los-angeles-fires-pictures" target="_blank"&gt;signs that a loved one could be affected&lt;/a&gt; by the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" title="Warning over injury which 'may double' risk of developing dementia" href="/lifestyle/life/163944/warning-injury-double-risk-developing-dementia" target="_blank"&gt;Dementia encompasses a spectrum of symptoms&lt;/a&gt; that accompany t&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" title="Night-time dementia warning sign in your sleep 'decades' before symptoms appear" href="/news/health/163548/night-dementia-warning-sign-sleep-decades-before-symptoms" target="_blank"&gt;he gradual worsening of brain function&lt;/a&gt;; in the US alone, nearly &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" title="Dementia experts highlight unusual kitchen habit as early warning sign" href="/news/health/163166/dementia-signs-alzheimers-warning-fridge-kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;a million individuals are grappling with its challenges&lt;/a&gt;, and that number is predicted to swell with the demographic shift toward an older population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the hallmarks of dementia like memory loss are widely recognized, some manifestations may not be as apparent. In an article for Alzheimer's Research UK, Dr. Rittman conveyed the complexity of diagnosing dementia in its nascent phases and how it can easily be mistaken for other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged the common uncertainty faced when changes are noticed in someone you know, "And that means it can be hard to know how much to worry if you think someone might be a bit different than when you last saw them. That's understandable – it's something many of us know very little about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, a YouGov survey revealed a gap in public awareness, with less than half of those surveyed (49%) capable of identifying "memory loss" as a consequence of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mere 12% of the 2,162 respondents were aware that the disease leads to a loss of independence, while a significant portion (22%) confessed to having no clue about the repercussions of living with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a surprising finding, given how dementia will impact so many of us", Dr Rittman expressed. "It is important, then, to raise awareness of early signs of dementia so people with symptoms can be referred to a memory clinic for a full assessment and an accurate, timely diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An early diagnosis means that people with dementia and their loved ones can plan for the future, access the right care and support, and consider the option of taking part in research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Rittman then highlighted some of the key symptoms to be aware of. He stated, "When it first starts, dementia's signs and symptoms are often mild and not that easy to spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mild forgetfulness, changes to perception or the way we speak can be early indications that something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't Miss:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/entertainment/celebrity-news/163145/donald-trumps-words-super-bowl"&gt;Donald Trump's telling words at the Super Bowl exposed by lip reader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/163166/dementia-signs-alzheimers-warning-fridge-kitchen"&gt;Dementia experts highlight unusual kitchen habit as early warning sign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/161023/five-early-signs-dementia-including-one-shows-bed-night" target="_blank"&gt;Five early signs of dementia - including one that shows in bed at night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really important to know that these kinds of symptoms can have other causes, such as low mood, or the side-effects of medications. But they could be early signs of dementia," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Rittman, issues with memory and thinking are symptoms of dementia that might become noticeable when someone is watching television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He elaborated, "Early on, forgetfulness could be mild, affecting memory for places or things that have happened in the past. You may notice someone asking the same question in quick succession or struggling to remember the names of objects around the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People may find they struggle to concentrate on daily tasks, or they may find following the storyline of a TV program difficult for example."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:13:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNS0hlR2dwc2VnQnVJQlI4cGFqVlltRlNGS3VmWmdERW1Wb0lTTndObWxxNnZjZzVINWhTb3JQWUVuVm0tWl9rSDdLZ3pJcnB2V3F3bzIxMTQzUjJxQ1hYRlE3WjZpRGd3R3RVNEphejdsYXJBMVhjNUo1X1lqNm5pMGYtbkUyLWtMaDk1U1dkMVJIMFNDQ25hUEI1c2V5Y3NU</guid></item><item><title>From green tea to turmeric: Scientists warn against 5 foods that may be damaging the liver - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this day and age, where health often takes a backseat, mostly due to an unhealthy diet, we tend to compensate for it by popping dietary supplements. From multivitamins to calcium and fish oil, you can easily find OTC supplements in nearby stores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;58% of U.S. adults take dietary supplements, including 64% of women and 51% of men, according to the 2017–18 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A 2024 poll suggests that 75% of adults take supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 study published in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34331346/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Liver Transplantation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; points out that drug-induced acute live failure tied to herbal and dietary supplements had increased eightfold from 1995 through 2020. The herbal and dietary supplements contribute to roughly 20% of liver toxicity cases nationwide, according to 2017 research published in the journal Hepatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does that mean you should toss away your multivitamin stash and other dietary supplements? However, it is important to know what you are incorporating into your routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Michigan noted last year that 15.6 million Americans consume products containing at least one of these six botanicals linked to liver damage:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turmeric&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Green tea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ashwagandha&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Garcinia cambogia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red yeast rice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black cohosh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a previous study, we found that there was a great deal of mislabeling of some of these products. We performed analytical chemistry and found about a 50% mismatch between the stated ingredients on the label and what they actually contained, which is quite alarming. If you buy a supplement and it says it has a certain ingredient, it’s basically a coin flip if that’s true or not,” senior author Dr. Robert Fontana, a Michigan Medicine hepatologist, said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We weren't aware that so many people were taking these supplements. So, when doctors see patients in the office, they don't necessarily ask about supplement use or take into consideration their effects," Likhitsup, who's also a transplant hepatologist adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many studies also suggested that toxic heavy metal contamination was found in some &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/4-supplements-to-avoid-if-you-want-to-live-longer/articleshow/117403418.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;supplements.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the FDA regulates supplements, the federal agency does not review them for safety, quality, and effectiveness. The FDA regulates them as food, not drugs. So, it is up to the manufacturers to properly label their products, and then the FDA reviews after they hit the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How to stop your nails from breaking often&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to stay safe is to communicate with your healthcare providers about the supplements you are taking. Also, don’t fall for ‘megadosing’ trends for speedy results. The Office of Dietary Supplements, part of the National Institutes of Health, has established daily upper limits (ULs) for safe consumption. For instance, adults shouldn’t consume more than 100 micrograms of vitamin D in a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>HHS cancels the CDC’s ‘Wild to Mild’ flu vaccine campaign: Report - Washington Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxOd0FmdEVpaThvdkoybWI0c2YyblRrLV9tZHMxejhMZlM5dVpheTlsWG5ySXhCeG5KVVZEc083bXAwY0sxNlJOVGEwQTJwcTdxdlVfNEtYNWt0VF9xYkwzMnJmaF9SQlNtVFNDc0tNSTNEYklkVFBoOWxKMlFYQktKRnRfTHNQQjdQUlM4eFRseW9oeVdHRmNNTU9iUGc1RVZ2eHdZMDZzeWtxNVJTSUtFQXB4NF85dFZJeUVmcg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cf-column"&gt;

But it’s not all a figment of the imagination either — narcissists are also more likely to be excluded from groups due to their strong personality types. Over time, this exclusion can exacerbate narcissistic traits further, creating a “self-perpetuating cycle,”  researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YULDLDPXHZCZFMME62JJ25SIQU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study sheds new light on how personality traits can impact everyday life, according to lead author &lt;a href="https://psychologie.unibas.ch/de/personen/christiane-buettner/" target="_blank"&gt;Christiane Büttner, of the University of Basel in Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;. “Many people think of narcissism in terms of entitlement and arrogance, but our research highlights that narcissists also frequently experience social pain,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B5CQQJZOVREYZA4LCJLP5KVF5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Büttner worked with a global team of researchers, which used large-scale surveys, sampling and controlled experiments on people based in&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Germany, the United States, Britain, Switzerland and New Zealand. While the negative impacts of social exclusion are well documented, Büttner wanted to understand who was being excluded most often and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YZCIQZ3SZNGSDHMYIGO6FHBZYQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts regard narcissism as a continuous trait; however, the research team focused on those with higher narcissism scores and “grandiose narcissists” in particular. Büttner said she regards this as an “intriguing personality trait,” as it involves a desire to dominate social situations and a heightened sensitivity to social cues. It’s in contrast to vulnerable narcissism, which is more closely linked to insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OLMXAYF5EBCGVFPAH24EQ6KEI4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“One of the biggest questions going into this research was whether narcissists might actually report less&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;ostracism because their grandiose self-image could shield them from perceiving negative treatment, or whether they would report more ostracism due to heightened sensitivity to social cues,” Büttner told The Washington Post in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O62JWWM7AVAWPICGAX2O6RNIUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Our findings strongly supported the latter: narcissists, particularly those high in the antagonistic, rivalry facet of narcissism, report being ostracized more frequently.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HR76XF3DBVALRECSJ3A2MWY7DY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However her team made a striking discovery, finding that “it’s not just a matter of perception — narcissists are actually excluded more often,” Büttner said. Results showed “ostracism and narcissistic traits reinforce each other over time,” she said, meaning that for those cast out of a group dynamic, it can become a vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZHHERF536BFOFMUTRLH2X3XICY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers used data from &lt;a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jbnst-2018-0022/html" target="_blank"&gt;Germany’s Socio-Economic Panel&lt;/a&gt;, a long-running survey of approximately 22,000 households, and homed in on 1,592 people with higher narcissism scores.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Narcissistic traits were assessed based on a short form of the &lt;a href="http://www.persoc.net/persoc/uploads/Toolbox/NARQ_English.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;, which differentiates between two subfacets — admiration and rivalry — with people grouped into personality types based on their responses to statements such as: “I deserve to be seen as a great personality”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;and “Most people are somehow losers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5NDTVDLJP5D53PSZTQDUN3ME2E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Levels of ostracism were assessed based on responses to statements such as “Other people have ignored me” or “Other people have shut me out from conversations,”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;with participants asked to answer on a scale between 1 (meaning never) and 7 (always).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JUBU3BW56JA4NN3G3XYWVXM5VE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers focused on whether people&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;had reported ostracism over a two-month period in 2015 and found that “individuals with higher levels of narcissism retrospectively report getting ostracized more frequently than individuals with lower levels of narcissism.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QWMBBWTNLBHGBD2SBBQZBCQDOA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;They also carried out six follow-up experiments involving&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;more than 2,500 people in total. One of these included a virtual ball-throwing game where two other players either included or excluded the participant. The participant was then asked to report on how many throws they had received and whether they felt they had actively participated in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XX3NIGE2RNBXVA6EZ6M2GMZTQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another experiment involved hypothetical discussions where the participant was told someone “must have forgotten” that they attended a concert together, and asked if they felt they had been excluded. Taken together, researchers said they found people with higher narcissism scores were more likely to perceive ambiguous social interactions as deliberately exclusionary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DQKXA7F42FALBOYKH257B2NJ3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A final piece of the puzzle involved analyzing&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;14 years of data from a &lt;a href="https://osf.io/75snb/wiki/Publications/" target="_blank"&gt;national survey in New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; of more than 72,000 people. It showed feelings of exclusion were followed by changes in narcissism levels a year later — and vice versa — demonstrating that “ostracism seems to solidify narcissistic traits over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N3CPQNQXYVHMDKVNRSYZGAURXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For Büttner, the most interesting takeaway was that not only do narcissists view themselves as victims of social exclusion, but their behavior actively contributes to it in a cycle that can “fuel the development of narcissistic traits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="COI4VXBPMJCKRE27SSV6IKIJWU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This means that narcissists who are excluded may become even more narcissistic in response, potentially increasing their likelihood of future exclusion,” she said. “That’s an important insight because it suggests that ostracism doesn’t just happen &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; narcissists, instead, it seems to be part of a self-perpetuating cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KDDMA2US6VG7NEY2GY6W6JDB4U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom who was not involved in the research, said the findings back up previous findings that narcissists are “hypersensitive” to social exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UXAGE744YVB3RCHFQCJBCHCOOE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We already know that narcissists tend to be selfish and lack empathy for others, and that over time they become less well-liked and cause conflict in their relationships,” she told The Washington Post in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JGYH5Z7RNZCYTCSXZ3HGCXQO6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The findings are in line with our previous research showing that narcissists can be paranoid that others mean them harm, even when there is no evidence for this. Our research suggests that this is due to narcissists’ constant need to defend their grandiose yet fragile sense of self — they are always on the lookout for ego-threat so they can deflect it quickly,” Hepper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CHE4ZXKWYNF6TPEZ7EIAIZKFUI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Büttner said one of the study’s main limitations was that while the team used&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;multiple methods like surveys, experiments and longitudinal data, most of the researchers’ findings relied on self-reported experience of ostracism. While experiments helped to bridge this gap, further observational research could be done to develop understanding, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I3TIFFKTARFDRBLOSELR5XLXWA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another potential limitation to the new study’s findings was that narcissism was studied in healthy, student, community and representative samples, the research said, and severely narcissistic individuals may react differently.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Previous studies indicate that even small increases in narcissism have been shown to increase aggression, stop the forming of successful relationships and lead to mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BQLLUQSLBBCQJPFJSKQNSCMJ74" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Overall, Büttner said the findings could have implications for managing conflict in large groups, such as the workplace or on social media. How to disrupt such behavioral patterns or prevent them occurring in the first place are also&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“important questions for future research,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LMHCQY23OVCP7HB4BB7DQE6UZI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Büttner noted that narcissism is “a risk factor for downstream mental health consequences of ostracism, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PC3MSDA4ANBBTM2ESHNFSOR37U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Addressing these dynamics in structured ways, whether in workplaces, therapy, or social interactions, could help reduce the negative consequences of exclusion for both narcissistic individuals and those around them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 15:08:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPS3JWYW1lb3V5Q3g3V1hzVHB2bVBCUGdMMzYyVExYbXZ1R1R4Q210MW9DUFIteUFkcDhlSldZMGhmMVI1Mlp4ZklUaW1xcXdQUzRUREZ4bWJCVUJ0QUFRRDFjc3UtamFJS0I5aV90RS1rSWhGN2pvSnpFamJtdjNZS19yX2xFMDZGbEpBMzNaNEt2RURZelBOb29TeWkzbDVE</guid></item><item><title>Narcissists are significantly more likely to feel excluded, new study finds - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPaTExYVR0ajM2a3owU0dEZENRX0J6a2phRFlBRG8wZjRfSFRTMnNYOG40MUthWVV0MmRaMDZpN1VSLUxTVUVmUmdaQ0d4WTRpNlBnM0FRaDJhLVp2aC1YSFpqXzliOUgzVWZGSHBPbXRaY25oc1AxTFVfWGVvTjhEdFhBVjhLNUh1c1NmUk9VWnZvZElHcWdFUmZDRdIBkgFBVV95cUxQSXVBS2NmV3Y3R25oRnZWcnM0QUVBTXlRZ2RHRU9MdXVuT1B3SUVHbDcxdnhWVTM3bUxSU0wwaDMzbTJjczBmVThvUlFJRFVLMVR0RWFpQ21OaEg4N2x1WTJOUWRnTDQtdDgtRGxhdWo4aEVpVkVvNTVGUjF6cDB6Sm5ZZ2hBd01EWEg3ODdnQjBVdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            If you don’t personally &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/22/health/spot-narcissists-wellness/index.html"&gt;know a narcissist&lt;/a&gt;, you can likely think of a few celebrities or politicians who display entitlement, lack empathy and crave constant admiration.

            Grandiose narcissists, also known as overt narcissists, are particularly notorious for their &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/health/narcissism-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;inflated sense of self-importance&lt;/a&gt; and relentless need for attention — traits that may match the description of someone you just thought of. Unlike covert narcissists, who mask their behavior with self-pity, grandiose narcissists rely on charm and manipulation to thrive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Now, a new study has found&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;grandiose narcissists are not only more likely to feel ostracized but are also genuinely excluded more often than those with less egocentric personalities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9fyf50006356m0ym5mzes@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study, published Thursday in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspp0000547" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/a&gt;, examined 77,000 participants across multiple studies, controlled experiments and real-world scenarios, to identify why narcissists experience higher levels of exclusion.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        How narcissism and exclusion fuel one another
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9bxck0000356mof0gb7ox@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Narcissists often display disruptive behaviors in social settings, such as aggression or arrogance, that increase the likelihood of others distancing themselves over time. These self-absorbed individuals are also highly sensitive to social status and ambiguous cues, making them more likely to perceive exclusion even when it’s not happening, according to the study.

            “There’s a very thin-skinned quality to narcissistic people, so if they even get a whiff that they are being left out, they’re going to be acutely aware of that,” said Los Angeles-based licensed clinical psychologist Dr. Ramani Durvasula, who treats people with &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662" target="_blank"&gt;narcissistic personality disorder&lt;/a&gt; and has written several books on the topic, including “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-You-Identifying-Narcissistic/dp/0593492625" target="_blank"&gt;It’s Not You&lt;/a&gt;: Identifying and Healing From Narcissistic People.” “It’s picking up a glance or not liking a social media post.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            However, Durvasula, who was not involved in the research, noted these perceived slights are usually unintentional — someone may simply be too busy to engage with a post or look away without realizing it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000g356mxhw8s2sr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But when narcissists overreact to perceived acts of ostracism, friends, family members or colleagues may start avoiding them out of concern for their behavior.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000h356mde911xn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            Narcissists tend to view themselves as victims when they feel ostracized. This victim mentality intensifies their antagonistic behaviors, pushing people even further away, said Christiane Büttner, lead study author and social psychologist at Switzerland’s University of Basel.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000j356mck6cmvv2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This suggests that ostracism doesn’t just affect narcissists in the moment — it might shape their personality development in ways that perpetuate future exclusion,” Büttner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000k356mkh4w5iae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the new study examined individuals who scored high on narcissism tests, it did not specifically focus on those with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6710132/" target="_blank"&gt;pathological narcissism&lt;/a&gt;, Durvasula noted. She said she believes the effects of narcissism and exclusion would be even more extreme in individuals with clinical narcissistic personality disorder.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000l356muwxfgy08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study also found that individuals who exhibit narcissistic rivalry, viewing others as competition and acting more aggressively, are more likely to be ostracized than those with high levels of narcissistic admiration, who seek attention and status in socially engaging ways rather than isolating themselves, Büttner said. This pattern is particularly common in workplace dynamics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000m356m3ln8mn6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s actually a natural social perceptiveness narcissistic people have, which is why they can be quite successful in leadership and business,” Durvasula said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000n356mmgpxvc8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, narcissists typically only use this skill when it benefits them and blame others in most situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9grj5000c356motpl0agu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Narcissistic behaviors need to be addressed early on. This proactive approach is challenging because schools can attempt to enforce anti-bullying policies to counteract such behavior, but outside of the classroom, social exclusion is harder to control, Durvasula said, pointing to the example of a child not being invited to a birthday party.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0s000u356m5trmxaxk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that anti-bullying practices should be just as much about anti-ostracism behaviors to look out for the kid who may not be fitting in with peers as well and monitoring the situation,” Durvasula said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000v356mmvpu7le3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If children don’t receive therapy for narcissistic traits, it becomes increasingly difficult for them to change as they enter adulthood, and narcissistic tendencies may intensify over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000w356myb6jxg66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To improve, narcissists need consistent intervention through therapy. Therapists must also be mindful of developmental traumas, childhood environment, attachment issues and any other psychological factors that may have shaped their narcissistic personality, according to Durvasula.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000x356msl6x7tw6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Usually the (final straw) that gets a narcissistic person to therapy is either sadness or anxiety, but they will still often pin it to something happening outside of them,” Durvasula said. “My boss is never fair to me, I can’t get promoted, I don’t have enough money, my spouse is mean to me.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000y356my8abaeip@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Social skills training or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness/index.html"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; could help narcissists challenge assumptions that people are excluding them, while doing deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation and reframing negative thoughts could help them develop healthier coping mechanisms to prevent future ostracism, Büttner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7c9hi300010356macx4wbqt@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="handling-a-relationship-with-a-narcissist" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Handling a relationship with a narcissist
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hdod000s356mfjkxp01v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study primarily examined examples of narcissism &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/health/energy-vampire-in-person-work-wellness/index.html"&gt;in the workplace&lt;/a&gt;, but Durvasula said dealing with a narcissist in a family or friend circle is often more challenging due to the deeper emotional history involved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0015356m6a5jympj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whether you’re navigating a work or personal relationship with a narcissist, Durvasula suggests empathic disengagement or yellow rocking, a strategy of remaining pleasant and polite in their presence without overperforming or sacrificing your mental well-being to satisfy them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0017356m8bq2klzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Narcissists in work and personal relationships create challenges for others who have to manage their disruptive behaviors and pick up more responsibilities because they can’t rely on them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0018356m90xr3qgy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In work settings, this might look like a narcissist colleague not pulling their weight in a team of five. Other team members may hesitate to confront this person for fear of the reaction, ultimately picking up their share of the work instead, Durvasula said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0019356mbqfx8vb5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Family members face similar challenges, often creating backup plans to avoid last-minute chaos, as they can’t rely on a narcissist to follow through on commitments, such as picking someone up from the airport.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l001a356m5e9ht9w3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for when to disengage fully, Durvasula said it’s a personal decision. Some people may need to cut ties after just a few negative experiences, while family members might tolerate behavior for years or even decades from some narcissists.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If you don’t personally &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/22/health/spot-narcissists-wellness/index.html"&gt;know a narcissist&lt;/a&gt;, you can likely think of a few celebrities or politicians who display entitlement, lack empathy and crave constant admiration.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9fyf40004356m4y24t2xp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Grandiose narcissists, also known as overt narcissists, are particularly notorious for their &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/health/narcissism-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;inflated sense of self-importance&lt;/a&gt; and relentless need for attention — traits that may match the description of someone you just thought of. Unlike covert narcissists, who mask their behavior with self-pity, grandiose narcissists rely on charm and manipulation to thrive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9fyf50005356miz8nw63d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, a new study has found&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;grandiose narcissists are not only more likely to feel ostracized but are also genuinely excluded more often than those with less egocentric personalities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9fyf50006356m0ym5mzes@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study, published Thursday in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspp0000547" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/a&gt;, examined 77,000 participants across multiple studies, controlled experiments and real-world scenarios, to identify why narcissists experience higher levels of exclusion.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7c9g2jf0009356m7x4pz9y6@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="how-narcissism-and-exclusion-fuel-one-another" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            Narcissists often display disruptive behaviors in social settings, such as aggression or arrogance, that increase the likelihood of others distancing themselves over time. These self-absorbed individuals are also highly sensitive to social status and ambiguous cues, making them more likely to perceive exclusion even when it’s not happening, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9gsv0000e356mlbqa4y4l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0s000u356m5trmxaxk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that anti-bullying practices should be just as much about anti-ostracism behaviors to look out for the kid who may not be fitting in with peers as well and monitoring the situation,” Durvasula said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000v356mmvpu7le3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If children don’t receive therapy for narcissistic traits, it becomes increasingly difficult for them to change as they enter adulthood, and narcissistic tendencies may intensify over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000w356myb6jxg66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To improve, narcissists need consistent intervention through therapy. Therapists must also be mindful of developmental traumas, childhood environment, attachment issues and any other psychological factors that may have shaped their narcissistic personality, according to Durvasula.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000x356msl6x7tw6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Usually the (final straw) that gets a narcissistic person to therapy is either sadness or anxiety, but they will still often pin it to something happening outside of them,” Durvasula said. “My boss is never fair to me, I can’t get promoted, I don’t have enough money, my spouse is mean to me.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hf0t000y356my8abaeip@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Social skills training or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness/index.html"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; could help narcissists challenge assumptions that people are excluding them, while doing deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation and reframing negative thoughts could help them develop healthier coping mechanisms to prevent future ostracism, Büttner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7c9hi300010356macx4wbqt@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="handling-a-relationship-with-a-narcissist" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Handling a relationship with a narcissist
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9hdod000s356mfjkxp01v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study primarily examined examples of narcissism &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/health/energy-vampire-in-person-work-wellness/index.html"&gt;in the workplace&lt;/a&gt;, but Durvasula said dealing with a narcissist in a family or friend circle is often more challenging due to the deeper emotional history involved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0015356m6a5jympj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whether you’re navigating a work or personal relationship with a narcissist, Durvasula suggests empathic disengagement or yellow rocking, a strategy of remaining pleasant and polite in their presence without overperforming or sacrificing your mental well-being to satisfy them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0017356m8bq2klzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Narcissists in work and personal relationships create challenges for others who have to manage their disruptive behaviors and pick up more responsibilities because they can’t rely on them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0018356m90xr3qgy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In work settings, this might look like a narcissist colleague not pulling their weight in a team of five. Other team members may hesitate to confront this person for fear of the reaction, ultimately picking up their share of the work instead, Durvasula said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l0019356mbqfx8vb5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Family members face similar challenges, often creating backup plans to avoid last-minute chaos, as they can’t rely on a narcissist to follow through on commitments, such as picking someone up from the airport.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7c9i05l001a356m5e9ht9w3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for when to disengage fully, Durvasula said it’s a personal decision. Some people may need to cut ties after just a few negative experiences, while family members might tolerate behavior for years or even decades from some narcissists.
    &lt;/p&gt;

It taps into a very real cultural moment where everyone seems obsessed with aging... and how to prevent it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While getting older is technically a good thing, it’s also understandable to want to look and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63497087/how-to-age-well-biohacking-longevity-tips/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63497087/how-to-age-well-biohacking-longevity-tips/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="feel as young as possible" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;feel as young as possible&lt;/a&gt;. But we're not talking about Botox here. The idea of "reverse aging," or turning back your actual "biological clock" (a.k.a. the age of your cells) is really buzzy right now thanks to a bevvy of longevity bros, biohacking podcasts, and a general trend towards preventative health practices. And a growing body of research suggests it may actually be possible—on some level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The idea of "reverse aging" is a little complicated, but doctors say that it is possible to hack your health to get the most out of your lifespan.

As mentioned, there has been some research on animals that seems to suggest it's possible. One study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.04.522507v1.full" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.04.522507v1.full" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="bioRxiv" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in 2023 that found that a certain cocktail of proteins helped elderly mice live twice as long as their counterparts who didn’t get the cocktail. The mice who received the intervention also had DNA hallmarks that were similar to younger animals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Another 2023 study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867422015707" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867422015707" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cell" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;gave engineered mice (i.e. mice that have been genetically modified in a lab setting) a certain drug that altered their DNA. The mice were first given a drug to speed up their aging, and then given a cocktail that seemed to reverse some of those changes in their muscles, kidneys, and eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;And a 2024 study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867424009140" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867424009140" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cell" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that monkeys who were given a daily dose of metformin (a medication used to treat diabetes) had slower age-associated brain decline than those who didn’t get the drug. Those metformin-taking monkeys also had brain activity that was similar to monkeys that were about six years younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But despite these interesting results, research on the concept of "reverse aging" is still ongoing, and scientists are limited to animal cell data at this point. “There is a long distance between local effects on cells and rejuvenating the entire body’s aging processes, which involve multiple cell types, organs, and function,” Dr. Tallia says. “For centuries, humans have been looking for the ‘Fountain of Youth,’ but it is fair to say that we aren’t there yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-can-i-do-to-help-reverse-cell-aging" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can I do to help reverse cell aging?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Right now, there’s no magic drug or treatment that will help reverse your biological age, but doctors universally agree that certain lifestyle modifications can go a long way toward helping you to live a longer, healthier life—and even potentially look and feel better than you do now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;To be fair, if you're already health-conscious, none of these "hacks" are all that surprising, and Dr. Fudyma says they're really just “the basics” of good health. But given how essential these steps can be in protecting your cell health, they’re worth considering if you don't already have them in rotation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="20" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Aim for at least seven hours of quality sleep a night&lt;/strong&gt;. “This helps us recharge and restore several cellular functions,” Dr. Fudyma says. “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178124000453" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178124000453" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Research" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that restful sleep is also potentially helpful for reducing the risk of dementia.” FYI, this is a *minimum* amount. Everyone needs different amounts of sleep, but the general rule of thumb is that you should aim for between&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63575056/how-to-get-good-deep-sleep/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63575056/how-to-get-good-deep-sleep/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" seven to nine hours per night" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt; seven to nine hours per night&lt;/a&gt;. Remember, quality over quantity! And establishing regular sleep patterns (consistent bedtime and wake-up times) is also important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Follow a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g27157249/high-protein-vegan-meals/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g27157249/high-protein-vegan-meals/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="plant-forward diet" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;plant-forward diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This doesn't mean you can't eat animal products. But you might consider following a Mediterranean-style diet (making sure to get plenty of fish), Dr. Mandelbaum says. Dr. Fudyma also recommends doing your best to limit &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63592662/ultraprocessed-foods-list/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63592662/ultraprocessed-foods-list/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ultra-processed foods" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; in your diet, along with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a20052150/is-red-meat-bad-for-you/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a20052150/is-red-meat-bad-for-you/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="red meat" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Try to maintain a healthy weight&lt;/strong&gt;. Being overweight or having obesity can be hard on your body in multiple ways, and that stress will ultimately increase your biological age, Dr. Fudyma says. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Get in 150+ minutes of exercise a week&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63797315/how-exercise-lowers-dementia-risk/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63797315/how-exercise-lowers-dementia-risk/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Physical activity is good for your brain" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Physical activity is good for your brain&lt;/a&gt; and your body, Mandelbaum points out. “When you exercise, you improve your brain function through Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF),” he says. Working out regularly can also lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, boost your memory, and lower your risk of depression—all of which can support a better biological age, he says. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Cut back on alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;. “There’s &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62598179/lies-about-alcohol/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62598179/lies-about-alcohol/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="more and more evidence" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;more and more evidence&lt;/a&gt; coming out that links alcohol consumption to &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/oash-alcohol-cancer-risk.pdf" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/oash-alcohol-cancer-risk.pdf" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cancers" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(18)31571-X/fulltext" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(18)31571-X/fulltext" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="poor overall health" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;poor overall health&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Fudyma says. If you do drink alcohol, he recommends scaling back a little or even considering cutting it out entirely. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Don’t smoke&lt;/strong&gt;. “Smoking is definitely something that leads to biological aging,” Dr. Fudyma says. “It’s incredibly beneficial for the aging process to stop.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Slather on sunscreen&lt;/strong&gt;. Skin cancer is the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/skin#:~:text=Overview,%2C%20clinical%20trials%2C%20and%20more." target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.gov/types/skin#:~:text=Overview,%2C%20clinical%20trials%2C%20and%20more." data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="most common" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;most common&lt;/a&gt; type of cancer in the US, making it really important to protect your skin. Dr. Tallia recommends using sunscreen regularly and doing your best to avoid spending too much time in the sun to lower your risk. This will keep your skin cells fresh and healthy (plus, fewer wrinkles!).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Stay on top of your oral hygiene&lt;/strong&gt;. Chronic inflammation from poor oral hygiene can contribute to the aging process, Dr. Fudyma says. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10669972/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10669972/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Research" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has even linked bad oral health to a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;     &lt;strong&gt;Try to tamp down on stress&lt;/strong&gt;. Some level of stress is inevitable in life, but Dr. Fudyma says that doing what you can to dial it down by meditating or slowing down in general can be helpful. Emotional stress puts physical stress on your body and cells, which can increase your biological age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-can-you-really-reverse-your-age" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much can you really reverse your age?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;There’s no hard and fast answer to how many years you can clip off your biological age, and doctors are hesitant to pinpoint an exact range.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amlodipine, which costs 4p per tablet, is given to patients with high blood pressure to prevent heart disease, heart attacks and strokes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fascinating graphs show how ADHD prescriptions have risen over time, with the patient demographic shifting from children to adults with women in particular now driving the increase&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It lowers blood pressure by relaxing and widening blood vessels, making it easier for the heart to pump blood around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with ADHD can suffer debilitating symptoms including difficulty paying attention, restlessness and poorer impulse control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team of researchers from&lt;span&gt; the UK, Iceland and Germany &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;said of their latest findings: '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;There was a significant main effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; with amlodipine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;causing a reduction in impulsive responses in the fish. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-025-02062-x"&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/a&gt;, they added that this was because amlodipine suppresses neuron activity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists then separately examined the effect of amlodipine on Brits already diagnosed with ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using data from the UK Biobank health study, they discovered that over 50 people on amlodipine also reported taking medications typically prescribed for ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These patients reported&lt;span&gt; fewer mood swings and less risk-taking behaviour than those on other blood pressure drugs like ramipril, sold under the brand name Tritace, the researchers added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-482c59a0-c689-11ef-97d0-c3f99d0c58a6" class="class"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;

Some 3.6 per cent of boys and 0.85 per cent of girls suffer in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms typically appear at an early age and become more noticeable as a child grows.

Even for frail older adults—those at elevated risk of adverse health outcomes—greater activity was associated with lower dementia risks.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers found dementia risk decreased with higher amounts of physical activity. Dementia risks were 60% lower in participants in the 35 to 69.9 minutes of physical activity/week category; 63% lower in the 70 to 139.9 minutes/week category; and 69% lower in the 140 and over minutes/week category.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For their analysis, the researchers analyzed a dataset covering nearly 90,000 adults living in the U.K. who wore smart-watch-type activity trackers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(24)00879-X/abstract"&gt;&lt;span&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; was published online January 15 in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journal of the American Medical Directors Association&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Our findings suggest that increasing physical activity, even as little as five minutes per day, can reduce dementia risk in older adults,” says study lead author &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3809/amal-asiri-wanigatunga"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amal Wanigatunga&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, PhD, MPH, assistant professor in the Bloomberg School’s Department of Epidemiology. Wanigatunga is also a core faculty member at the Johns Hopkins Center on Aging and Health and has a joint appointment at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “This adds to a growing body of evidence that some exercise is better than nothing, especially with regard to an aging-related disorder that affects the brain that currently has no cure.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dementia, usually from Alzheimer’s disease, is one of the most common conditions of old age. It is estimated to affect about seven million people in the U.S., including about a third of those who are 85 years or older. Although the risk of dementia rises with age, studies in recent years have suggested that dementia is somewhat preventable, within a normal lifespan, by lifestyle changes that include better control of cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar, and being more active.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The minimum amount of activity needed to reduce dementia risk meaningfully isn’t yet clear. For many older individuals, especially frail ones, the high amounts of exercise recommended in official guidelines are unattainable and may discourage any exercise at all. Both the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.K. National Health System recommend that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week, an average of 20 minutes per day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For their study, Wanigatunga analyzed data on British adults generated as part of the UK Biobank project, a long-running, ongoing study of approximately 500,000 individuals. The dataset for the new study covered 89,667 adults, mostly in their 50s and older, who used wrist-worn accelerometers to track their physical activity for a week during the period from February 2013 to December 2015. Follow-up of their health status extended for an average of 4.4 years, through November 2021, during which 735 of the participants were diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The analysis compared individuals whose trackers showed some weekly moderate to vigorous physical activity to those whose trackers showed none and accounted for age and other medical conditions. The associations between higher activity and lower dementia risk were striking. Participants in the lowest activity category, ranging from one to 34.9 minutes per week, had an apparent risk reduction of about 41%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the researchers took into account participants who met their definitions of frailty or “pre-frailty,” they found that the association between more activity and less dementia was essentially unchanged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This suggests that even frail or nearly frail older adults might be able to reduce their dementia risk through low-dose exercise,” Wanigatunga says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wanigatunga notes that the study was not a clinical trial that established causation indicating that exercise reduces dementia risk, but its findings are consistent with that hypothesis. To check the possibility that their findings reflected undiagnosed dementia leading to lower physical activity, the researchers repeated their analysis but excluded dementia diagnoses in the first two years of follow-up. The association between more activity and lower dementia risk remained robust.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wanigatunga and his colleagues recommend that future clinical trial-type studies investigate low-dose exercise as an important initial step towards increasing physical activity as a dementia-preventing strategy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(24)00879-X/abstract"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity at Any Dose Reduces All-Cause Dementia Risk Regardless of Frailty Status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;” was co-authored by Amal Wanigatunga, Yiwen Dong, Mu Jin, Andrew Leroux, Erjia Cui, Xinkai Zhou, Angela Zhao, Jennifer Schrack, Karen Bandeen-Roche, Jeremy Walston, Qian-Li Xue, Martin Lindquist and Ciprian Crainiceanu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Funding for the study was provided by the National Institute on Aging (K01 AG076967, R01 AG075883).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;# # #&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="IT"&gt;Media contacts: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jonathan Eichberger &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:je@jhu.edu"&gt;&lt;span&gt;je@jhu.edu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;span lang="IT"&gt;Kris Henry &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:khenry39@jhu.edu"&gt;&lt;span lang="IT"&gt;khenry39@jhu.edu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span lang="IT"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;                 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In recent years, a growing number of scientific studies have backed an alarming hypothesis:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="152673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease isn't just a disease, &lt;a href="scientists-identify-a-virus-and-two-types-of-bacteria-that-could-be-linked-to-alzheimer-s"&gt;it's an infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the exact mechanisms of this infection are something researchers are &lt;a href="scientists-think-alzheimer-s-may-be-caused-by-our-brains-defence-system"&gt;still trying to isolate&lt;/a&gt;, numerous studies suggest the &lt;a href="alzheimers-disease-beta-amyloid-source-outside-brain"&gt;deadly spread&lt;/a&gt; of Alzheimer's &lt;a href="surgical-tools-could-spreading-alzheimers-proteins"&gt;goes way beyond&lt;/a&gt; what we used to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such study, published in 2019, suggested what could be one of the most definitive leads yet for a bacterial culprit behind Alzheimer's, and it comes from a somewhat unexpected quarter: gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a paper led by senior author Jan Potempa, a microbiologist from the University of Louisville, researchers reported the discovery of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyromonas_gingivalis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – the pathogen behind &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_periodontitis"&gt;chronic periodontitis&lt;/a&gt; (aka gum disease) – in the brains of deceased Alzheimer's patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=" wf_caption"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="/images/2019-01/530-alzheimers-gum-disease-bacteria-1.jpg" alt="530 alzheimers gum disease bacteria 1" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis' gingipains&lt;/em&gt; (red) among neurons in the brain of a patient with Alzheimer's. (Cortexyme)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't the first time the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.02788.x"&gt;two factors have been linked&lt;/a&gt;, but the researchers went further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In separate experiments with mice, oral infection with the pathogen led to brain colonization by the bacteria, together with increased production of amyloid beta (Aβ), the sticky proteins commonly associated with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team, coordinated by pharma startup Cortexyme, which was co-founded by first author Stephen Dominy, wasn't claiming to have discovered definitive evidence of Alzheimer's causation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was clear they thought we had a strong line of investigation here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Infectious agents have been implicated in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease before, but the evidence of causation hasn't been convincing," &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324298"&gt;Dominy said at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now, for the first time, we have solid evidence connecting the intracellular, Gram-negative pathogen, &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;, and Alzheimer's pathogenesis."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the team identified toxic enzymes called gingipains secreted by the bacteria in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, which correlated with two separate markers of the disease: the tau protein, and a protein tag called ubiquitin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even more compellingly, the team identified these toxic gingipains in the brains of deceased people who were never diagnosed with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's important, because while &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; and the disease have been linked before, it's never been known – to put it simply – whether gum disease causes Alzheimers, or whether dementia leads to poor oral care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152675" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152675" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642.jpg" alt="dentist checking x rays" class="wp-image-152675 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152675" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Does gum disease cause Alzheimer's, or could those with dementia be at greater risk of poor dental hygiene? (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-in-gray-long-sleeve-shirt-holding-black-tablet-computer-v_2FRXEba94"&gt;Jonathan Borba/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that low levels of gingipains were evident even in people who were never diagnosed with Alzheimer's could be a smoking gun – suggesting they might have developed the condition if they had lived longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our identification of gingipain antigens in the brains of individuals with AD and also with AD pathology but no diagnosis of dementia argues that brain infection with &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; is not a result of poor dental care following the onset of dementia or a consequence of late-stage disease, but is an early event that can explain the pathology found in middle-aged individuals before cognitive decline," the authors explained &lt;a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/1/eaau3333"&gt;in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, a compound formulated by the company called COR388, showed in experiments with mice that it could reduce bacterial load of an established &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; brain infection, while also reducing amyloid-beta production and neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll have to wait and see what future research will uncover about this link, but the research community is cautiously optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Drugs targeting the bacteria's toxic proteins have so far only shown benefit in mice, yet with no new dementia treatments in over 15 years it's important that we test as many approaches as possible to tackle diseases like Alzheimer's," chief scientific officer David Reynolds from Alzheimer's Research commented in a &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/bacteria-behind-gum-disease-linked-to-alzheimers/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were reported in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aau3333"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story was published in January 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers developed a neural network model showing that people fine-tune their attention based on past experiences with distractions. Unlike traditional models that study one task with a single distraction, this study tested multiple simultaneous distractions, simulating real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that people primarily adjust by suppressing previously distracting inputs rather than enhancing focus on a task.

To deal with this, a person could adjust their attention to downplay those crunch noises or focus their hearing on the speaker. But understanding how human brains do this has been a challenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with a new neural network model, researchers at Washington University in St. Louis have a better tool to uncover what brain mechanisms are at play when people need to focus amid many distractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107902"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a head and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/attention-distraction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The key innovation in this work is that usually researchers study this problem with only one source of relevant information and one source of distracting information. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model, now published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;, demonstrates that people focus not by concentrating extra hard on a subject, but by ignoring inputs that were distracting in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous work showed that when people encounter a very difficult task, they adjust their attention to make them impervious to new distraction,” said study author Wouter Kool, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences in Arts &amp;amp; Sciences at WashU. “However, it remained unclear how they adjusted their attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not that people may not do both forms of attention control — concentrate and reduce distractions — but how they do that can be affected by the difficulty of previous tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our work, previous difficulty also clearly affected their sensitivity to current difficulty,” Kool said, summarizing their findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key innovation in this work is that usually researchers study this problem with only one source of relevant information and one source of distracting information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example of this older work is the Stroop task, which includes a list of words for colors that can match or not match the color in which the word is printed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By investigating the delay in reaction time when participants are asked to name the color of mismatching words, researchers have created simple neural network models to understand how humans focus on tasks. But again, that’s one distraction, one task. Kool’s postdoctoral researcher Davide Gheza wanted to change it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We increased the sources of distraction, mimicking a cocktail party or a conference meeting,” Gheza said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Stroop task that involves simple colored words, their task requires to choose among two complex stimuli with varying shapes, colors, borders and motion directions. This is meant to bring four total sources of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By running participants through a series of trials where each of the four sources could be either the target task or one of the distractions, “we found strong evidence that people were really modulating their attention to the distractor and not so much to the target,” Kool said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People tune their attention very specifically,” he said. “If something or someone was distracting before, you learn to ignore them in the future, but you stay open to other inputs that might help complete the task.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step will be testing this model on brain data collected while participants perform this task in an MRI scanner. Gheza and Kool believe this will help them pin down what specifically is happening in people’s brains while they encounter and overcome multiple sources of distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was financially supported by a Multi-University Research Initiative grant (ONR/DoD N00014-23-1-2792) to Kool and by a McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience grant to Gheza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this attention and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0c607f646d6a6a697e4c7b797f786022696879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leah Shaffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wustl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WUSTL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Leah Shaffer – WUSTL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-024-02088-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Distractor-specific control adaptation in multidimensional environments&lt;/a&gt;” by Wouter Kool et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distractor-specific control adaptation in multidimensional environments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goal-directed behaviour requires humans to constantly manage and switch between multiple, independent and conflicting sources of information. Conventional cognitive control tasks, however, only feature one task and one source of distraction. Therefore, it is unclear how control is allocated in multidimensional environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this question, we developed a multidimensional task-set interference paradigm, in which people need to manage distraction from three independent dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use this task to test whether people adapt to previous conflict by enhancing task-relevant information or suppressing task-irrelevant information. Three experiments provided strong evidence for the latter hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, control adaptation was highly dimension specific. Conflict from a given dimension only affected processing of that same dimension on subsequent trials, with no evidence for generalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new neural network model shows that our results can only be simulated when including multiple independent conflict-detector units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results call for an update to classic models of cognitive control and their neurocomputational underpinnings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 13:58:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9sTGtONkdPZHNlZzlIcEZhaW8wN19aRnBuYkdoUnRGU2s0WjdTWDBwWGU0WWtFSldzamV4QlRGY29wU0hJSDQweXJNZVhDZkMtQXQxRzE1cHBJOUtfM09OMVdyQ1ZSS0pRc1R1SXY2czdqdmwyVjFtX0JR</guid></item><item><title>In Texas, vaccine-choice activists are ascendant - The Economist</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxObjU2U1hIT0NZbG5tbHRELUU2UmhMbl9JT0NtUVBrN2FOQnhvZUVQcW1MM3d0R2FwSVhtZGg4d1Bkb2dlU2lvcXFfZ2l1cU1DeE9HMGVyY2FxM0c3U0xOeEthdktYeDI3WjRQc2x2amhmUkYxTzZ5cmhISzdQbXI1VDdESFNVdGNCYlQ1ZzMzN2xzQU1FNUd1SXIyQU1sa2s?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-80cr42 e1lrptjp2"&gt;&lt;p data-component="paragraph" class="css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0"&gt;&lt;span data-caps="initial"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;n the oil&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt;towns&lt;/small&gt; of west Texas a measles outbreak is spreading.

As well as being used in sweet foods and drinks, they are found in many savory products, such as ready meals, ketchups and sauces, and even bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most commonly used is aspartame, also known by its brand names, which include Nutrasweet®, Equal®, and Sugar Twin®. It is 200 times sweeter than sugar so, although it contains calories, much less is needed to give the same level of sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10822749/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that artificial sweeteners may have adverse health effects, particularly if consumed often. They have been associated with several health conditions, including affecting the functioning of the gastrointestinal system, causing headaches and taste alteration, and increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-071204" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiovascular disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; (CVD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study investigating the effect of aspartame in mice has provided further evidence that it may contribute to CVD risk, and outlines how it might do this. The study found that aspartame triggered spikes in release of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323760" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt; — the hormone that controls blood glucose — leading to the build up of fatty plaques, or &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/atherosclerosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:atherosclerosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, in the arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413125000063?via%3Dihub" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cell Metabolism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides compelling evidence linking aspartame consumption to increased risk of atherosclerosis through an insulin-mediated inflammatory pathway.

They also assessed the health of their blood vessels at 4, 8 and 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Insulin spikes after consuming aspartame&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within 30 minutes of consuming aspartame, the mice’s insulin levels increased significantly. The researchers noted that this was not surprising, given that there are sweetness-detecting receptors lining the mouths, intestines, and other tissues of both mice and people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These receptors help guide insulin release after sugar is eaten. Aspartame, being 200 times sweeter than sugar, seemed to trick the receptors into triggering much higher insulin release.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not only directly after aspartame consumption that insulin levels were raised. Mice on the aspartame diet had persistently high insulin levels, suggesting that long-term consumption of this artificial sweetener may lead to &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/305567" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which greatly increases the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317462" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research adds to growing concerns about the metabolic effects of artificial sweeteners.

The data indicate that aspartame triggers insulin spikes via parasympathetic activation, leading to chronic hyperinsulinemia. This, in turn, upregulates CX3CL1, an immune signal that attracts inflammatory cells, exacerbating arterial plaque formation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 4 weeks of the aspartame diet, the mice started to develop atherosclerotic plaques in their arteries, which increased by the 8 and 12-week point. In mice fed sucrose, the plaques did not develop until the 12-week point, although these mice did gain weight and fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en/people/yihai-cao" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yihai Cao;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Yihai Cao&lt;/a&gt;, who studies chronic diseases related to blood vessel disorders at Karolinska Institute in Sweden, told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that the discovery of CX3CL1 was unexpected, but might help the development of more effective drugs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because [CX3CL1] is transmembrane protein, it will be locked on the endothelial cells lining in the inner layer of blood vessels. In this way, it can trap moving inflammatory cells in the blood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yi explained why replacing sugar with artificial sweeteners might not decrease risk of metabolic disorders:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This mechanism could explain why diet soda drinkers, despite avoiding sugar, still show a heightened risk for metabolic diseases. Chronic insulin elevation is a well-known risk factor for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and the inflammatory response triggered by CX3CL1 may contribute to long-term cardiovascular damage.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limiting aspartame intake may benefit health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cao said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1073617" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; that he and his team plan to verify their findings in people.

These neurons, located in the ventral striatum, separately process better-than-expected and worse-than-expected outcomes. In experiments with mice, silencing these neurons altered their anticipation of rewards, affecting their decision-making behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that the brain tracks a full range of possible rewards, rather than just an average, which aligns with machine-learning models of decision-making. If confirmed in humans, the findings could explain difficulties in assessing risks seen in conditions like depression and addiction. Future research will explore how uncertainty influences this brain circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Neural Groups:&lt;/strong&gt; One group processes better-than-expected outcomes, while another tracks worse-than-expected ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision-Making Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain represents a full spectrum of possible rewards, not just averages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Clinical Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could help explain impaired risk assessment in conditions like depression and addiction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Harvard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every day, our brain makes thousands of decisions, big and small. Any of these decisions — from the least consequential such as picking a restaurant to the more important such as pursuing a different career or moving to a new city — may result in better or worse outcomes.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does the brain gauge risk and reward in making these calls? The answer to this question continues to puzzle scientists, but a new study carried out by researchers at Harvard Medical School and Harvard University offers intriguing clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107898"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a head." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/risk-reward-dopamine-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These two groups of brain cells work together to form a representation of the full distribution of potential rewards for a decision. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published Feb. 19 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; and supported in part by federal funding, incorporated machine-learning concepts into mouse experiments to study the brain circuitry that supports reward-based decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists uncovered two groups of brain cells in mice: one that helps mice learn about above-average outcomes and another associated with below-average outcomes. Together, the experiments showed, these cells allow the brain to gauge the full range of possible rewards associated with a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that mice — and by extension, other mammals — seem to be representing more fine-grained details about risk and reward than we thought before,” said co-senior author Jan Drugowitsch, associate professor of neurobiology in the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed in humans, the findings could provide a framework for understanding how the human brain makes reward-based decisions and what happens to the ability to judge risk and reward when reward circuitry fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine learning illuminates reward-based decisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists have long been interested in how the brain uses past experiences to make new decisions. However, according to Drugowitsch, many traditional theories about such decision-making fail to capture the complexity and nuance of real-world behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugowitsch uses the example of selecting a restaurant: If you’re in the mood to play it safe, you might choose a restaurant with a menu that experience tells you is reliably good, and if you feel like taking a risk, you might opt for a restaurant that you know offers a mix of exceptional and subpar dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above example, the restaurants differ considerably in their range of offerings, yet existing neuroscience theories consider them equivalent when averaged, and thus predict an equal likelihood of choosing either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that this is not how humans and animals act — we can decide between seeking risks and playing it safe,” Drugowitsch said. “We have a sense of more than just average expected rewards associated with our choices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, machine-learning researchers developed a theory of decision-making that better captures the full range of potential rewards linked to a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They incorporated this theory into a new machine-learning algorithm that outperformed alternative algorithms in Atari video games and a range of other tasks in which each decision has multiple possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They basically asked what happens if rather than just learning average rewards for certain actions, the algorithm learns the whole distribution, and they found it improved performance significantly,” Drugowitsch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2020 &lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;paper, Naoshige Uchida, professor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University, and colleagues reanalyzed existing data to explore whether this machine-learning theory applied to neuroscience, in the context of decision-making in rodent brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that in mice, activity of the neurotransmitter dopamine — which plays a role in reward-seeking, pleasure, and motivation — corresponded to reward-learning signals predicted by the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Drugowitsch said, the work suggested that the new algorithm was better at explaining dopamine activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How mouse brains represent a range of rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Drugowitsch teamed up with co-senior author Uchida to take the research a step further. Together, they designed mouse experiments to see how this process plays out in a brain region called the ventral striatum, which stores information about possible rewards associated with a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dopamine activity only provides the learning signal for expected rewards, but we wanted to find representations of these learned rewards directly in the brain,” Drugowitsch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers trained mice to associate different odors with rewards of varying magnitudes — in essence, teaching mice the range of possible outcomes of a choice. They then presented the mice with odors, and observed licking behavior (mice lick more in anticipation of better rewards) while recording neural activity in the ventral striatum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team identified two distinct groups of neurons in the brain: One that helps a mouse learn about better-than-expected outcomes and another tied to worse-than-expected outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can think of this as having an optimist and a pessimist in your brain, both giving you advice on what to do next,” Drugowitsch explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers silenced the “optimistic” neurons, the mouse exhibited behavior suggesting that it anticipated a less appealing reward. Conversely, when the researchers silenced the “pessimistic” neurons, the mouse behaved as if it expected a higher value treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These two groups of brain cells work together to form a representation of the full distribution of potential rewards for a decision,” Drugowitsch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers see many future directions for their work, including how the brain makes decisions when there is more uncertainty about what each initial option represents and how their findings apply to more general reasoning about the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugowitsch noted that more research is needed to confirm the results in humans and to adapt the findings to the complexity of human decision-making. However, based on the parallels between mouse and human brains, he believes the work may already shed some light on how humans assess risk in decisions and why people with certain conditions such as depression or addiction may struggle with such assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorship, funding, disclosures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional authors on the paper include Adam Lowet, Qiao Zheng, Melissa Meng, and Sara Matias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (R01NS116753; F31NS124095), the Human Frontier Science Program (LT000801/2018), the Harvard Brain Science Initiative, and the Brain &amp;amp; Behavior Research Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this decision-making and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5135343f3f38220e3f34303d3e3f11393c227f393023273023357f343524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dennis Nealon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://harvard.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Dennis Nealon – Harvard&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08488-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;An opponent striatal circuit for distributional reinforcement learning&lt;/a&gt;” by Jan Drugowitsch et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An opponent striatal circuit for distributional reinforcement learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning research has achieved large performance gains on a wide range of tasks by expanding the learning target from mean rewards to entire probability distributions of rewards—an approach known as distributional reinforcement learning (RL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to underlie RL in the mammalian brain by updating a representation of mean value in the striatum, but little is known about whether, where and how neurons in this circuit encode information about higher-order moments of reward distributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, to fill this gap, we used high-density probes (Neuropixels) to record striatal activity from mice performing a classical conditioning task in which reward mean, reward variance and stimulus identity were independently manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to traditional RL accounts, we found robust evidence for abstract encoding of variance in the striatum. Chronic ablation of dopamine inputs disorganized these distributional representations in the striatum without interfering with mean value coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetics revealed that the two major classes of striatal medium spiny neurons—D1 and D2—contributed to this code by preferentially encoding the right and left tails of the reward distribution, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We synthesize these findings into a new model of the striatum and mesolimbic dopamine that harnesses the opponency between D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons to reap the computational benefits of distributional RL.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 13:35:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE5LMEFBbFNmNEU2M2tGNkJtQVRsaDN2RFQ4eHB2QVFmQXhTMVZlSnZud2FhZ19wVU95QndRdndTQkwzOGVfZ1lraG5jSzlsdWx2czNpSlNPRkxaUHBnUWJsRkJKZ1B1SVFFVWpxTWRKcU0xX1U1NzJsSXdR</guid></item><item><title>Why Is This Indonesian Volcano Spewing Blue Lava Instead of Red?

&lt;p&gt;In the eastern reaches of &lt;strong&gt;Java, Indonesia&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Kawah Ijen&lt;/strong&gt; volcano stuns the world with a spectacle of &lt;strong&gt;neon-blue flames&lt;/strong&gt; lighting up its crater at night. While it appears as if the volcano is spewing &lt;strong&gt;blue lava&lt;/strong&gt;, the truth is even more fascinating. This rare phenomenon, combined with one of the &lt;strong&gt;most acidic lakes on Earth&lt;/strong&gt; and a grueling sulfur mining industry, makes Kawah Ijen one of the most extraordinary and perilous volcanic sites on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Science Behind the Blue Flames&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the mesmerizing sight, the &lt;strong&gt;blue glow&lt;/strong&gt; seen at Kawah Ijen is not actual lava, reports &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-does-indonesian-volcano-burn-bright-blue-180949576/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Smithsonianmag&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it results from the &lt;strong&gt;combustion of sulfuric gases&lt;/strong&gt;. When sulfur-rich gases escape from the volcano’s cracks at temperatures reaching &lt;strong&gt;600°C (1,112°F)&lt;/strong&gt;, they ignite upon contact with oxygen, producing vibrant &lt;strong&gt;blue flames&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, &lt;strong&gt;molten sulfur&lt;/strong&gt; continues to burn as it flows down the slopes, creating the illusion of glowing&lt;strong&gt; blue rivers&lt;/strong&gt;. This spectacle is only visible at night since daylight overpowers the &lt;strong&gt;luminescent effect&lt;/strong&gt;. While other volcanoes worldwide also release sulfuric gases, Kawah Ijen’s chemical composition and gas concentrations make this phenomenon particularly intense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The World’s Most Acidic Crater Lake&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the summit of Kawah Ijen lies a surreal &lt;strong&gt;turquoise crater lake&lt;/strong&gt;, which holds the title of the largest acidic lake on Earth. Its extreme acidity is due to &lt;strong&gt;high levels&lt;/strong&gt; of sulfuric and hydrochloric acid, giving it a pH as low as &lt;strong&gt;0.13 in its center&lt;/strong&gt;—so acidic that it can dissolve metals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This lake isn’t just a scientific &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/nasa-curiosity-rover-captures-clouds-mars/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="79093" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;curiosity&lt;/a&gt;; it’s also a source of environmental concern. The &lt;strong&gt;Banyupahit River&lt;/strong&gt;, which originates from the lake, carries its acidic waters downstream, affecting aquatic life and vegetation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its stunning appearance, the lake is &lt;strong&gt;extremely dangerous&lt;/strong&gt;, and prolonged exposure to its acidic fumes can cause &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/8-signs-your-mental-health-is-declining/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="75990" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;severe health issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Harsh Reality of Sulfur Mining&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond its natural beauty, Kawah Ijen is a working volcano, where hundreds of &lt;strong&gt;sulfur miners&lt;/strong&gt; risk their lives daily. The volcano’s fumeroles release thick clouds of &lt;strong&gt;toxic gases&lt;/strong&gt;, and miners use&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/danger-in-the-pipes-drinking-water-map-reveals-states-worst-hit-by-lead-contamination/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73589" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; simple pipes&lt;/a&gt; to channel and condense the sulfur, allowing it to solidify into bright yellow blocks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These workers then break the sulfur by hand and carry loads of up to &lt;strong&gt;90 kilograms (200 lbs)&lt;/strong&gt; down the steep crater—sometimes multiple times per day. Without proper protective equipment, many suffer from &lt;strong&gt;respiratory diseases&lt;/strong&gt; due to prolonged exposure to hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With an &lt;strong&gt;average life expectancy of only 40 years&lt;/strong&gt;, these miners endure some of the harshest working conditions in the world, making Kawah Ijen not just a place of natural wonder, but also of human struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Balance Between Tourism and Conservation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blue flames of Kawah Ijen have become a major tourist attraction, drawing adventurers from all over the world. Guided treks begin in the early hours of the morning, allowing visitors to witness the mesmerizing blue glow before sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the &lt;strong&gt;rising popularity of the site&lt;/strong&gt; comes with environmental and safety concerns. Unregulated tourism and increasing foot traffic threaten the delicate ecosystem of the &lt;strong&gt;acidic lake and sulfur fields&lt;/strong&gt;. At the same time, tourists venturing too close to the flames without proper gas masks risk severe &lt;strong&gt;respiratory distress&lt;/strong&gt; from the toxic fumes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Efforts are being made to ensure that conservation measures are put in place while allowing sustainable tourism, but striking this balance remains a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Place of Danger and Wonder&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kawah Ijen is a land of extremes, where &lt;strong&gt;fire burns blue, water is acid&lt;/strong&gt;, and miners battle&lt;strong&gt; deadly gases daily&lt;/strong&gt;.

It is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with around one million deaths and two million new cases reported in 2020. This disease primarily affects people over 50, and its increasing prevalence poses a growing challenge to healthcare systems worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRC originates in the colon or rectum, where abnormal cells grow uncontrollably and can spread to other organs, such as the liver and lungs. Conventional treatments, including chemotherapy, are often accompanied by significant side effects like immunosuppression, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-develop-worlds-first-universal-gene-therapy-for-anemia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anemia&lt;/a&gt;, and organ toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, cancer cells frequently develop resistance to these drugs, diminishing their effectiveness. These challenges highlight an urgent need for safer, more effective therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research offers hope by exploring alternative treatments derived from natural compounds.

The plant is known for its greenish-silver leaves and strong aromatic scent. It has long been valued in traditional medicine for its diverse therapeutic properties, including &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/fish-guts-could-be-the-future-of-skin-care-products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibacterial&lt;/a&gt;, antifungal, antispasmodic, and vasorelaxant effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secret behind these medicinal properties lies in its rich phytochemical composition. The plant contains a variety of compounds, including flavonoids, phenolics, alkaloids, monoterpenoids, and essential oils. These natural chemicals are known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic effects. They not only boost the immune system but also demonstrate significant anticancer properties by targeting cancer cells selectively, leaving healthy cells unharmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study conducted by scientists at the &lt;a href="https://www.sharjah.ac.ae/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Sharjah&lt;/a&gt; revealed that an extract from Artemisia herba-alba exhibited strong anti-cancer properties against colorectal cancer cells. Published in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsn3.4715" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Food Science and Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, the research highlights the plant’s potential to disrupt cancer cell growth and induce cell death without harming normal cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results suggest that Artemisia herba-alba has great potential as a new tool in fighting CRC (colorectal cancer),” said Dr. Lara Bou Malhab, the study’s lead author and research associate at Sharjah University’s Research Institute for Medical and Health Sciences. “It could be a promising natural ingredient for new cancer treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_artemisia_herba_alba_targets_cancer_cells"&gt;How Artemisia herba-alba Targets Cancer Cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved extracting active compounds from the aerial parts of Artemisia herba-alba collected from southern Jordan. After drying and grinding the plant material into fine powder, researchers used a methanol-based extraction process to obtain the highest concentration of phytochemicals. This extract was then tested on eight different colorectal cancer cell lines to evaluate its impact on cancer cell growth, survival, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The effect of A. herba-alba extract on different cell cycle regulatory and apoptotic markers proteins.

The extract not only inhibited the growth of cancer cells but also triggered apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death crucial for eliminating cancer cells. It disrupted the cell cycle by reducing the activity of proteins like Cyclin B1 and CDK1, which are essential for cancer cell division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the extract blocked the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, a key driver of cancer development and progression. This pathway plays a significant role in cell survival, proliferation, and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-mrna-vaccine-revolutionizes-pancreatic-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism in cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;. By inhibiting this pathway, Artemisia herba-alba effectively starved the cancer cells of the signals they need to grow and survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current study underscores the extract's selective cytotoxicity against CRC cell lines, highlighting its potential to serve as a complementary treatment to existing cancer therapies,” Dr. Bou Malhab explained. “Our findings highlight the immense potential of Artemisia herba-alba as a natural source for developing innovative therapies against colorectal cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_new_frontier_in_cancer_treatment"&gt;A New Frontier in Cancer Treatment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of Artemisia herba-alba's anticancer properties is significant for several reasons. First, it offers a potential alternative to traditional chemotherapy, which often causes severe side effects and faces issues of drug resistance. Natural compounds like those found in Artemisia herba-alba provide a more targeted and less toxic approach to cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The effect of A. herba-alba on different cell death markers p-AKT and p-mTOR. (CREDIT: Food Science and Nutrition) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, this study emphasizes the importance of exploring traditional medicinal plants as sources of new therapeutic agents. In many cultures, Artemisia herba-alba has been used for centuries to treat a range of health issues, including fever, gastrointestinal disorders, and respiratory problems. Its potential as an anticancer agent not only validates traditional knowledge but also opens up new avenues for scientific exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s success is also credited to the collaboration between researchers from the University of Sharjah and the University of Jordan. The botanical identification of the plant specimens was conducted by Prof. M. Hudaib, an expert in Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry at the &lt;a href="https://pharmacy.ju.edu.jo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Jordan's School of Pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers emphasized the importance of further investigation to fully understand the molecular mechanisms behind Artemisia herba-alba's anticancer effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bou Malhab stressed the need for continued research to explore the clinical efficacy of Artemisia herba-alba, stating, “Our findings demonstrate its cytotoxic effects, ability to induce apoptosis, and its capacity to arrest the cell cycle. This suggests a wider therapeutic significance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_future_of_artemisia_herba_alba_in_cancer_therapy"&gt;The Future of Artemisia herba-alba in Cancer Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential of Artemisia herba-alba as a natural anti-cancer agent is groundbreaking. As CRC cases continue to rise worldwide, there is an urgent need for treatments that are not only more effective but also less harmful than conventional chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these findings are confirmed through further research and clinical trials, Artemisia herba-alba could become an essential component of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/study-links-coffee-to-cancer-heart-disease-and-parkinsons-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer therapy&lt;/a&gt;. It might be used in combination with existing treatments to enhance their effectiveness and reduce side effects. Additionally, its natural origin could lead to more affordable cancer treatments, making them accessible to a broader population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the journey from laboratory research to clinical application is long and complex. More in-depth studies are required to understand the exact mechanisms of its anticancer action, optimal dosage, and potential side effects. The researchers call for extensive preclinical and clinical trials to confirm the efficacy and safety of Artemisia herba-alba in treating colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world where cancer remains one of the leading &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/groundbreaking-cancer-treatment-destroys-99-of-cancer-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;causes of death&lt;/a&gt;, the discovery of new, effective, and safe treatments is a beacon of hope. Artemisia herba-alba, an ancient remedy, may well be the key to modern cancer therapy, providing a natural and powerful weapon against one of the deadliest forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPbG1SaGlybmU4dEhKTVJuRTdqVlpTNk5RNnVOTEZKa3NrQUg3SFFaRDVrSjJaRTlzdEhNR3dKWXVvMS1pZ0JsaXVBQVlvNjg3emROeC1ORndacDBhYzJJZklBYzQzd2w2bFlsbDdlWmlRX1l1LVpzM1AzeTQ4YXVzOFg1dDBFRmo1Y25sWS1QRE0wemtweDU4QWdTTE5Ndw</guid></item><item><title>Valley man's near-amputation sparks warning for Black Arizonans - ABC15 Arizona in Phoenix</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxQemZSRHlYNGtQYjFYYnFKME1teEE4eHY2MjZaRU0zaVVWUHBRTEZrejNGMGRwX1g1QzJkdGctel91MEoteTJ2WnAtcHVoMmVnM0NHSE9EdWtsNHlfaXVGWDBVZElITHVBNm9GdjEwaUJxOTZjUGl2QS14S19XSFlLekFBOVlYSW1PQk9qQjczSkF0Q2FLS3ZaR2lsQU0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SURPRISE, AZ — A nagging foot wound that wouldn’t heal turned into a life-altering diagnosis for Gregg Province, a Surprise man who is now raising awareness about Peripheral Arterial Disease (P.A.D.), a serious but often underdiagnosed circulatory condition that disproportionately impacts Black Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, Province thought his non-healing foot wound was just a minor issue when he visited the podiatrist, but doctors discovered a 99% blockage in one of his lower leg arteries. He needed immediate surgery or risked amputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[The doctor] looked at the foot and said, told Lynn, take him to the emergency room now," Province recalled the physician telling his wife. "I didn’t know what was going on until I woke up from surgery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/peripheral-artery-disease#:~:text=Language%20switcher&amp;amp;text=Also%20called%20peripheral%20arterial%20disease,other%20parts%20of%20the%20body." data-cms-ai="0"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;, Peripheral Arterial Disease (P.A.D.) occurs when fatty deposits build up in the arteries reducing blood flow to the limbs, most commonly the legs. If left untreated, patients risk amputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just about the limbs, P.A.D. is strongly linked to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. The disease is most common in Black Americans, affecting nearly 1 in 10 over age 40, according to the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/facts-about-peripheral-artery-disease-pad" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Province never thought he was at any risk given he was active in his younger years—playing basketball, tennis, and softball—but as he aged, his activity level decreased while his love for treats, like double chocolate muffins and potato chips, didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought I was the cat’s meow, playing sports," Gregg laughed. “But my vices caught up to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After surgery to clear his arteries, Banner Health’s Dr. Ankur Shukla prescribed lifestyle changes and physical therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first sign that people will complain of is that they will say, 'Hey, Doc, when I'm walking to the grocery store, my legs start to cramp up,' or 'Hey, when I'm going out to the mailbox, my leg starts to cramp up," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, Dr. Shukla said P.A.D. is manageable, especially if it's caught early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg’s wife, Lynn, came to Dr. Shukla was pages full of questions after the surgery and came away from it with a renewed drive to focus on her and her husband's physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I told him, ‘I can want this for you, but if you don’t want it for yourself, there’s nothing I can do,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was Gregg’s wake-up call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with Lynn’s support, he’s walking regularly, watching his diet, and spreading the message to others—especially Black Arizonans—about the importance of early detection and not ignoring your heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The doctor can’t fix everything wrong with us. We have to fix it upstairs first—and just don’t wait," Gregg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re experiencing leg pain or wounds that won’t heal, talk to your doctor today—early intervention could save your limb or even your life.&lt;/p&gt;

EatingWell design. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, certain foods have been labeled as “bad” for heart health—often due to outdated nutrition myths or misleading advice from social media. However, research and expert insights reveal that many of these foods actually offer health benefits, including for the heart. In this article, we’ll highlight several so-called “bad” foods that may be better for your heart than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs have long been controversial due to their cholesterol content. However, the current body of research shows that dietary cholesterol found in food has less impact on blood cholesterol than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.amazon.com/Easy-Steps-Lower-Cholesterol-Portfolio/dp/B0D3B5LSDF/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2B74YF90IKZC7&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fNASg5aKg7nChWnaUVBCrwxWXwpFq6al5XmFgZoIGIha7FZQZPdNk8zJ0pUqGvUnC-8f5Q1U9CcxAgvkHyjE7w.VpzWQFKYCb58V2pveU65Fhg1zqqHjj59UFGGQNweqlI&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=veronica+rouse&amp;amp;qid=1722441546&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=veronica+rouse%2Cstripbooks%2C98&amp;amp;sr=1-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Veronica Rouse, RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Veronica Rouse, RD&lt;/a&gt;, owner of The Heart Dietitian and author of &lt;em&gt;Easy Steps To Lower Cholesterol &lt;/em&gt;points out a study in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; that found moderate egg consumption (up to one egg per day) is not associated with an increased risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, eggs are an excellent source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:complete protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;complete protein&lt;/a&gt; and provide essential nutrients like choline, which supports both heart and brain health. And don’t be afraid to eat the whole egg—the yolk is where most of the vitamins, minerals and heart-healthy antioxidants, like lutein and zeaxanthin, are found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Full-Fat Dairy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full-fat dairy products like yogurt and milk have long been criticized for their saturated fat content, but new research shows they can be part of a heart-healthy diet. Rouse states, “A 2023 review article found that full-fat dairy consumption was not associated with an increased risk of heart disease and may even have protective effects due to its unique nutrient profile.” Rouse goes on to list the numerous nutrients found in dairy, including calcium, probiotics and potassium, that can support healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Shellfish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shellfish, such as shrimp, mussels, lobster and oysters, are often avoided due to their cholesterol content. However, they’re actually rich in heart-healthy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; and low in saturated fat, making them a nutritious choice for cardiovascular health. Rouse points out, “Eating one to two servings of seafood per week may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and even death, especially when replacing less-healthy foods in the diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine has often been controversial for raising blood pressure, but moderate coffee consumption (around 2 to 3 cups per day) has been linked to heart-health benefits. Rouse states, “A 2022 study in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/em&gt; found that coffee drinkers had a significant reduction of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These potential benefits may have something to do with the antioxidants found in coffee, like chlorogenic acid and polyphenols, which help reduce inflammation and support blood vessel function. Just be mindful of what you add to your cup—too much sugar or heavy cream can make it less heart-healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Potatoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potatoes often get unfairly criticized, but they’re actually a nutrient-packed vegetable loaded with fiber, energizing complex carbohydrates, vitamin C and potassium, which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure. Rouse points out that what it all really boils down to is how they’re prepared. She recommends boiling or baking them with the skin on for added fiber, instead of frying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Chocolate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chocolate is often seen as a “bad” food that you should avoid for better health. However, dark chocolate with a high cocoa content (70% cocoa or more) can actually be a heart-healthy food choice in moderation. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013599/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-chocolate-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cocoa is rich in flavonoids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cocoa is rich in flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;, plant compounds that help lower blood pressure and improve circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research supports these benefits—a meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;The European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/em&gt; found that moderate chocolate consumption was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Tips for Supporting Heart Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a heart-healthy diet is important, it’s just one part of the bigger picture. Here are a few other habits to consider for keeping your heart strong and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds in the diet to get your fiber in. Most people should be aiming for about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043390/too-much-fiber/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:25 to 36 grams of fiber per day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;25 to 36 grams of fiber per day&lt;/a&gt;. Rouse mentions especially focusing on soluble fiber sources, as these can help lower your LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Omega-3s:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure to prioritize omega-3 fatty acids from foods such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, chia seeds and walnuts, as omega-3s can help reduce inflammation and support heart function. Rouse reminds us, “The American Heart Association recommends eating fish at least twice a week for optimal heart health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular physical activity strengthens the heart and improves circulation. Aim for the goal of at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week. Rouse emphasizes the importance of making movement realistic and sustainable, stating, “Even short bursts of 10-minute activity can help improve cholesterol levels and manage blood pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out some foods with a bad reputation can actually have surprising heart-health benefits. Eggs, full-fat dairy, shellfish, coffee, potatoes and dark chocolate can all be part of a heart-friendly diet when enjoyed in moderation and prepared in healthy ways.

EatingWell design. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For years, certain foods have been labeled as “bad” for heart health—often due to outdated nutrition myths or misleading advice from social media. However, research and expert insights reveal that many of these foods actually offer health benefits, including for the heart. In this article, we’ll highlight several so-called “bad” foods that may be better for your heart than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;1. Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eggs have long been controversial due to their cholesterol content. However, the current body of research shows that dietary cholesterol found in food has less impact on blood cholesterol than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In fact, &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.amazon.com/Easy-Steps-Lower-Cholesterol-Portfolio/dp/B0D3B5LSDF/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2B74YF90IKZC7&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fNASg5aKg7nChWnaUVBCrwxWXwpFq6al5XmFgZoIGIha7FZQZPdNk8zJ0pUqGvUnC-8f5Q1U9CcxAgvkHyjE7w.VpzWQFKYCb58V2pveU65Fhg1zqqHjj59UFGGQNweqlI&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=veronica+rouse&amp;amp;qid=1722441546&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sprefix=veronica+rouse%2Cstripbooks%2C98&amp;amp;sr=1-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Veronica Rouse, RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Veronica Rouse, RD&lt;/a&gt;, owner of The Heart Dietitian and author of &lt;em&gt;Easy Steps To Lower Cholesterol &lt;/em&gt;points out a study in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; that found moderate egg consumption (up to one egg per day) is not associated with an increased risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In reality, eggs are an excellent source of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:complete protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;complete protein&lt;/a&gt; and provide essential nutrients like choline, which supports both heart and brain health. And don’t be afraid to eat the whole egg—the yolk is where most of the vitamins, minerals and heart-healthy antioxidants, like lutein and zeaxanthin, are found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;2. Full-Fat Dairy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Full-fat dairy products like yogurt and milk have long been criticized for their saturated fat content, but new research shows they can be part of a heart-healthy diet. Rouse states, “A 2023 review article found that full-fat dairy consumption was not associated with an increased risk of heart disease and may even have protective effects due to its unique nutrient profile.” Rouse goes on to list the numerous nutrients found in dairy, including calcium, probiotics and potassium, that can support healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;3. Shellfish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shellfish, such as shrimp, mussels, lobster and oysters, are often avoided due to their cholesterol content. However, they’re actually rich in heart-healthy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; and low in saturated fat, making them a nutritious choice for cardiovascular health. Rouse points out, “Eating one to two servings of seafood per week may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and even death, especially when replacing less-healthy foods in the diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;4. Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Caffeine has often been controversial for raising blood pressure, but moderate coffee consumption (around 2 to 3 cups per day) has been linked to heart-health benefits. Rouse states, “A 2022 study in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/em&gt; found that coffee drinkers had a significant reduction of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These potential benefits may have something to do with the antioxidants found in coffee, like chlorogenic acid and polyphenols, which help reduce inflammation and support blood vessel function. Just be mindful of what you add to your cup—too much sugar or heavy cream can make it less heart-healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;5. Potatoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Potatoes often get unfairly criticized, but they’re actually a nutrient-packed vegetable loaded with fiber, energizing complex carbohydrates, vitamin C and potassium, which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure. Rouse points out that what it all really boils down to is how they’re prepared. She recommends boiling or baking them with the skin on for added fiber, instead of frying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;6. Chocolate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chocolate is often seen as a “bad” food that you should avoid for better health. However, dark chocolate with a high cocoa content (70% cocoa or more) can actually be a heart-healthy food choice in moderation. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013599/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-chocolate-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cocoa is rich in flavonoids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cocoa is rich in flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;, plant compounds that help lower blood pressure and improve circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Research supports these benefits—a meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;The European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/em&gt; found that moderate chocolate consumption was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Other Tips for Supporting Heart Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While a heart-healthy diet is important, it’s just one part of the bigger picture. Here are a few other habits to consider for keeping your heart strong and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds in the diet to get your fiber in. Most people should be aiming for about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043390/too-much-fiber/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:25 to 36 grams of fiber per day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;25 to 36 grams of fiber per day&lt;/a&gt;. Rouse mentions especially focusing on soluble fiber sources, as these can help lower your LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Omega-3s:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure to prioritize omega-3 fatty acids from foods such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, chia seeds and walnuts, as omega-3s can help reduce inflammation and support heart function. Rouse reminds us, “The American Heart Association recommends eating fish at least twice a week for optimal heart health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular physical activity strengthens the heart and improves circulation. Aim for the goal of at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week. Rouse emphasizes the importance of making movement realistic and sustainable, stating, “Even short bursts of 10-minute activity can help improve cholesterol levels and manage blood pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Turns out some foods with a bad reputation can actually have surprising heart-health benefits. Eggs, full-fat dairy, shellfish, coffee, potatoes and dark chocolate can all be part of a heart-friendly diet when enjoyed in moderation and prepared in healthy ways.

Rats fed the Med diet’s mix of olive oil, fish and fibre showed increases in four beneficial types of gut bacteria, compared to rats eating a high-fat diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These bacterial changes were linked to improvements in memory tasks, learning and ‘cognitive flexibility’: the ability to adapt to new information. The study also found some slight improvements in the rat’s spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Spatial memory is important because getting lost is one of the first signs of Alzheimer’s and we know from large population studies that people who eat a Med diet have a &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/mother-dementia-85-eat-reduce-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduced incidence of dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;reduced incidence of dementia&lt;/a&gt;,” says Dr Faye Begeti, a neurology doctor and neuroscientist at Oxford University Hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More research in humans is needed but its findings add to increasingly compelling evidence of the importance of the complex links between the gut and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So how can we cultivate a healthy gut that will also help to boost our brain’s cognitive skills? Here are seven things to try, based on the latest research and what the experts advise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;1. Eat your greens to reduce cognitive decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating one to two servings of green leafy vegetables daily is associated with slower cognitive decline - Getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Granny was right to emphasise the importance of eating up your &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/green-mediterranean-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dark, leafy greens;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;dark, leafy greens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a US &lt;a class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5772164/#" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of men and women aged between 58 and 99 years old, eating one to two servings of green leafy vegetables daily was associated with slower cognitive decline, with the group who ate their green veg having brains that were cognitively 11 years younger than those who didn’t eat regular greens. The greens that were eaten included spinach, kale, collards and lettuce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The diversity of plant foods also matters for our gut/brain health. “The more types of fibre and polyphenols we consume, the better our gut microbes can thrive – this is why eating a variety of plant-based foods (rather than just focusing on one or two specific ones) is so important,” says Dr Caitlin Hall, a neuroscientist and dietitian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;2. Eat probiotics to boost your memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chickpeas are a great source of prebiotics - Getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a &lt;a class="link " href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38424099/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by King’s College London last year, researchers found that adults aged over 60 who were given a prebiotic supplement rich in inulin performed better in memory tests used to capture early signs of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We can’t digest prebiotic fibres ourselves, but they feed our gut microbes, helping them to produce beneficial short-chain fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In the UK we’re missing about 35 per cent of the fibre we should be eating, and prebiotic fibres are particularly useful for our guts. In studies, we tend to use supplements as it’s easier to isolate that ingredient, but ideally, we want to look at a food-first approach. Inulin, for example, is found in asparagus, leeks, onions and garlic,” says Dr Emily Leeming, a dietitian, scientist and author of &lt;em&gt;Genius Gut: The Life-Changing Science of Eating for your Second Brain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Legumes such as chickpeas, lentils and beans are also a good source of brain-boosting prebiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;3. Drink kefir for improve your memory and mood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be wroth making kefir yourself, as not all commercial brands contain traditional grains - Getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two interesting studies have shown that drinking kefir, a fermented milk, is beneficial for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the first &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1028415X.2022.2046963" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, adults who drank the milk for four weeks improved their “relational memory”. “This is the type of memory that helps you to remember where your keys are and people’s faces and names,” Dr Leeming explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the second &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(13)00292-8/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers did brain scans on women who drank kefir twice daily for four weeks and then showed them negative and positive images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The researchers were looking at their emotional reactions, and they discovered that those drinking kefir had less of an emotional reaction to the negative images, which suggests that the fermented drink was making them more emotionally resilient. Mouse studies have also shown that consuming kefir grains seems to boost the neurotransmitters involved in reducing stress and anxiety,” Dr Leeming explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kefir is readily available to buy, although Dr Leeming suggests making it yourself, as not all commercial brands contain traditional grains. “You can easily buy the kefir grains, add them to milk, leave them for a day or so, and then strain,” she says. You can try kefir as a drink, have it with cereal, add it to your yogurt, or use it to make a creamy, tangy salad dressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;4. Have berries to help you focus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berries are a great source of polyphenols, along with dark chocolate, coffee and tea - Getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Berries are rich in polyphenols and flavonoids are good for focus, fatigue and your brain’s processing speed, studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/are-smoothies-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:berry smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;berry smoothie&lt;/a&gt; at 9am could help your brain stay sharp throughout the day, one &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/11/2685#B31-nutrients-11-02685" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; suggests. In the research, one group had a smoothie with berries blended in, and the other had a placebo. By 3pm, the placebo group were experiencing the traditional afternoon energy slump, but the group who drank the berry smoothie maintained their energy, focus and mental performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another &lt;a class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8180591/#" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; analysed how polyphenols impact cognition and found that they improved ‘visual information processing speed’ which is how fast your brain can take in and interpret what your eyes see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Polyphenols are also found in dark chocolate, extra virgin olive oil, coffee, tea and many fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;5. Eat breakfast to feed your brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Our brain is our most energy-hungry organ in our body, consuming 20 per cent of our energy daily, so it’s important not to skip a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Multiple studies have shown that adults who skip breakfast tend to have a lower mood and eat less fibre, which is already a problem. Even having something small is going to be a supporting start to our day, and good for our microbes,” says Dr Leeming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Aim for a balance of protein and healthy fats for stable blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;6. Pack in omega-3 to feed your gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oily fish, such as salmon, are packed with omega-3s which help feed our brains - Getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Research shows eating fish supports brain structure and reduces inflammation, thanks to DHA, a type of omega-3 found in high levels in fish. Yet in the UK we have low levels of omega-3s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Omega-3s have a direct influence on the cell membranes of our brains, but they’re also recognised as a potential prebiotic, having a similar effect to fibre in terms of feeding our gut microbes,” says Dr Leeming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Omega-3 is also found in walnuts and chia seeds, but this form is harder for our bodies to absorb than the DHA found in fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Non-vegetarians should aim for two portions of fish a week and if you’re a vegetarian, look into an omega-3 supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Why reducing stress is also important&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Your gut and brain health isn’t just about what’s on your plate. “Because the gut and brain are so interconnected via the gut-brain axis, &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/stress/toxic-stress-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; can also alter the gut microbiome, reducing the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which help protect against inflammation in the brain.

    &lt;p&gt;Research shows eating fish supports brain structure and reduces inflammation, thanks to DHA, a type of omega-3 found in high levels in fish. Yet in the UK we have low levels of omega-3s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Omega-3s have a direct influence on the cell membranes of our brains, but they’re also recognised as a potential prebiotic, having a similar effect to fibre in terms of feeding our gut microbes,” says Dr Leeming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 is also found in walnuts and chia seeds, but this form is harder for our bodies to absorb than the DHA found in fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-vegetarians should aim for two portions of fish a week and if you’re a vegetarian, look into an omega-3 supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why reducing stress is also important&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your gut and brain health isn’t just about what’s on your plate. “Because the gut and brain are so interconnected via the gut-brain axis, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/stress/toxic-stress-risk/"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; can also alter the gut microbiome, reducing the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which help protect against inflammation in the brain. Managing stress through movement and mindfulness doesn’t just improve digestion—it actively supports memory, focus, and long-term brain health,” says Dr Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So find stress relief that works for you. That might be breathwork, yoga or even just regular five-minute screen breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is also a proven stress reliever.

After the doctors ran CT and MRI scans of his head, they were shocked to find a huge pocket of fluid where his brain was meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In scans shared with medical journal The Lancet, the main part of the man's brain area appears black, indicating where the build up of fluid was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A man discovered he had been living with just half a brain after being hit by leg pain. The above image shows a build up of fluid - the black area - where his brain was mean to be&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drainage tubes in the patient's brain had narrowed, causing a build up of fluid to accumulate over the decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This caused his brain to squeeze into a narrow layer pushed against the rim of his skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, his skull had also enlarged. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the case, Lionel Feuillet, a neurologist at the Mediterranean University in Marseilles, said at the time the case report was published in 2004: 'We were very surprised when we looked for the first time the CT scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The brain was very, very much smaller than normal. This case is unique to our knowledge.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Feuillet said that his team had 'never encountered such severe hydrocephalus before' and it is likely the man had the condition from birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a bid to see how his condition had affected his mental ability, the doctors carried out a series of psychological tests on the male patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were further surprised to find that he was still able to function sufficiently with an IQ of 75, at the lower end of the 'normal' range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man also had built a successful life for himself, with a wife, two children and a job as a civil servant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After treatment, the man made a complete recovery although subsequent scans showed no change to the size of his brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scans revealed only a narrow rim of brain material pressed against the man's skull&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Feuillet said that the problems with his left leg were a neurological symptom of the man's brain condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, hydrocephalus or 'water on the brain' affects one out of every 770 babies, making it as common as Down syndrome and more common than spina bifida or brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is most common in both infants and older adults and it can be asymptomatic, which explains why the man went for years without noticing an impact to his health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the common symptoms, when they do surface, include h&lt;span&gt;eadaches, n&lt;/span&gt;ausea and vomiting, difficulty walking, vision problems, memory problems, incontinence and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment is shunt surgery and if it is left&lt;span&gt; untreated, hydrocephalus can be fatal due to increased pressure compressing the brainstem, which is responsible for regulating heart rates and breathing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A patient's prognosis after surgery depends on their age and general health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After treatment, the man made a complete recovery although subsequent scans showed no change to the size of his brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:22:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Man, 44, learns he's been living with half a BRAIN after subtle sign - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxNeldjRGI4dmVmVGpTVHRBdTk2aE5WS0JlekpCLUpHSjZYSVViTGRwX0liZjlXTHJDa3cwd2d1LUVveVZrZVg1c0VFQ2gyb3lzZXJXdG9KTmlSTjVBeUs1eGdkQ2hwRjM1cDZ0T0hBU0pPc0sxLVpuVXBPdzdSbEp4a08xbkVPekZ3UDY5NHdwVU1YZ3JjbnIwbkZ0dlJmREFwa05ya0RTTTdYNXEwbmhYX2FpMDBHRzZ2aFE3UmZ0VVc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A man discovered he had been living with just half a brain after &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14405067/teens-stomach-sign-deadly-brain-tumour-left-week-live.html"&gt;being hit by a common symptom&lt;/a&gt; that plagues millions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unnamed 44-year-old from the south of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/france/index.html" id="mol-e0ec9db0-eed6-11ef-8420-3fb9a6b84a55" class=""&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; started feeling a mild pain and weakness in his leg for around two weeks, which prompted him to visit his doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than a third of Americans suffer from some form of leg pain, which is usually down to muscle strain, arthritis or harder-to-identify causes, like vascular issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After doctors ruled out those common physical causes, they were concerned it could be due &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14406171/Killer-disease-paralysis-brain-swelling-Britain-ticks.html"&gt;to a neurological condition&lt;/a&gt; that affects nerve endings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there weren't any notable abnormalities in his medical history, they noticed that he had had a shunt surgery when he six months old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A shunt surgery - which involves implanting a thin tube into the brain to drain away excess fluid to another part of the body - was performed as he had an excess buildup of fluid on his brain but there was no cause identified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shunt was then removed when he was 14 years old.

(Vercammen was not involved in the new study.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone considering these treatments should have an "in-depth conversation" with a doctor about the potential benefits and weigh them against the "significant risks" involved, according to Vercammen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These risks include the possibility of serious side effects, such as &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain swelling and bleeding;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain swelling and bleeding&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the substantial financial costs associated with treatment, even if you have insurance coverage," he cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who may benefit from these treatments, Hartz recommended they talk to their doctors and review the potential risks and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This information could help contextualize how the medications may benefit them in terms of independence," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to the makers of Leqembi and Kisunla to request comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/two-alzheimers-drugs-help-patients-live-independently-home-longer-periods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Two Alzheimer’s drugs help patients live independently at home for longer periods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Two Alzheimer’s drugs help patients live independently at home for longer periods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:07:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE1hLW1CMkVUemlWN0hnXzJCUGQyTlF2YnFCdk5rcW1fbGU1XzVaeUlVLTlWb1dGbXZrRlZSc2QtMDVIUU4ySHJoaVJPclBBRWxNaTRaMFM4Yi1teXhYMXZSQlhPb0g3eDhTbWdzb0pDMnc1Wi1xVUVr</guid></item><item><title>New Five-Type Index Provides Doctors Guide for Long COVID - Medscape</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNd1lBSVRSQ0ZpMkdMZ0wtRk9WdnJXdHNsX295VTJyRmlYWG9GXy1uREtOTEJuZDU4dWdYaTZEM2o4OEJvT0V5Q1d4ejR3d0I3cV92OGFPUTZlNlQxQVpCeWxvY1pEUGEyRHMwRnY2TzBTZEVEZnpuekUzc18wV2VCWm9ZanV0cU1JRXVQdXRCaTJ2MlZBeDZGUVBaSW11RFJOeV9Hc0tR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new analysis of long COVID patients has identified five distinct subtypes that researchers say will help doctors diagnose the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2828329?guestAccessKey=77bdd800-1217-41f0-bada-33a43d62bde1&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=121824"&gt;new five-type index&lt;/a&gt;, developed by federal researchers with the National Institutes of Health’s RECOVER COVID Initiative, identified the most common symptoms in 14,000 people with long COVID, with data from an additional 4000 people added to the updated 2024 index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using the index, physicians and researchers can better understand the condition, which is difficult to treat and diagnose because no standard definitions or therapies have been developed. Doctors can use the index to offer more targeted care and help patients manage their symptoms more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The index may also help researchers find more treatments for long COVID. Because long COVID can affect so many different parts of the body, it will take time to fully understand how to treat it, but studies like this are making progress in the right direction, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new index uses an updated point system, where points are allotted to each symptom in a list of the 44 most reported symptoms in people with likely long COVID based on how often they occur. Among people in the study with prior COVID infection, 2213 (18%) met the threshold for long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 44 most common symptoms were then distributed among five subtypes, with each representing a difference in impact on quality of life and overall health. The most common symptoms were fatigue (85.8%), postexertional malaise (87.4%), and postexertional soreness (75.0%) — where persistent fatigue and discomfort occur after physical or mental exertion — dizziness (65.8%), brain fog (63.8%), gastrointestinal symptoms (59.3%), and palpitations (58%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with prior COVID infection, symptoms were more prevalent in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtype 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those grouped into subtype 1 did not report a high incidence of impact on quality of life, physical health, or daily function. Only 21% of people in subtype 1 reported a “poor or fair quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A change in smell or taste — usually a symptom that’s bothersome but doesn’t seriously impact overall health — was most present in subtype 1, with 100% of people in subtype 1 reporting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only other symptoms in over 50% of people with subtype 1— which were 490 of the 2213 with prior COVID infection — were fatigue (66%), postexertional malaise (53%), and postexertional soreness (55%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though these two symptoms can certainly impact quality of life, they became much more prevalent in other subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtype 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of possibly debilitating symptoms like postexertional malaise (94%), fatigue (81%), and chronic cough (100%) rose dramatically in people grouped into subtype 2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, 25% of people in subtype 2 reported a “poor or fair quality of life. Postexertional malaise, I think, is probably one of the most debilitating of the symptoms. When somebody comes in and tells me that they’re tired and I think they might have long COVID, the first thing I try to do is see if it is postexertional malaise vs just postinfectious fatigue,” said Lisa Sanders, MD, medical director of Yale’s &lt;a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2023/11/08/a-different-spirit-of-research-yale-clinic-seeks-to-unravel-the-mystery-of-long-covid/"&gt;Long Covid Multidisciplinary Care Center&lt;/a&gt; in New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postinfectious fatigue usually resolves much more quickly than postexertional malaise. The latter accounts for several symptoms as also associated with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). ME/CFS is a chronic illness that causes severe fatigue and makes it difficult for sufferers to perform routine, daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Postexertional malaise is an additive symptom of ME/CFS, and that can take a long time to resolve,” Sanders added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The similarity between these two symptoms highlights the importance that physicians must place in scrutinizing symptoms to a high degree when they suspect a patient of having long COVID, experts said. By doing so, clinicians can unveil the mask of overlapping symptoms between long COVID symptoms and symptoms of other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtype 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 37% of people grouped in subtype 3 reported a poor or fair quality of life, a significant rise from subtypes 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatigue symptoms were reported by 92%, whereas 82% reported postexertional soreness, and 70% reported dizziness. Additionally, 100% of people in subtype 3 reported brain fog as a symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders said these symptoms are also common in people with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. This condition results from a reduced volume of blood returning to the heart after standing up, which leads to an abnormally fast heart rate. Palpitations and fainting can then occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/how-to-manage-long-covid-brain-fog"&gt;Brain fog can be especially debilitating&lt;/a&gt; in people who are used to multitasking. With brain fog, people accustomed to easily alternating between tasks or doing multiple tasks at once can only do one thing at a time. This can cause stress and an overload of thoughts, even precipitating a change in careers if severe enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though brain fog tends to resolve within 6-9 months after infection, it can last up to 18 months or more. Experts say doctors should always be on the lookout if a patient complains they have trouble concentrating or multitasking in the months after a COVID infection. A neurological exam and cognitive testing can identify abnormalities in brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtype 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 40% of people in the study grouped into subtype 4 reported a poor or fair quality of life, a modest increase from those with subtype 3. About 65% reported symptoms of brain fog and 92% reported palpitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dizziness was also prevalent at 71%, whereas 60% reported gastrointestinal issues, and 36% said they experienced fever, sweats, and chills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 700 of the 2213 people fell into this subtype group, by far the highest number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtype 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A whopping 66% of people in subtype 5 reported a poor to fair quality of life. These people usually reported multisystem symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of prevalence rises across the spectrum of 44 common long COVID symptoms, 99% reported shortness of breath; 98%, postexertional soreness; 94%, dizziness; 92%, postexertional malaise; 80%, GI problems; 78%, weakness; and 69%, chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of Hispanic and multiracial participants were classified as having subtype 5. Also, according to the study, “higher proportions of unvaccinated participants and those with SARS-CoV-2 infection before circulation of the Omicron variant were in subtype 5.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests the severity of the Delta variant of COVID-19 be linked to some of the worst long COVID symptoms, but further study would have to be done to conclusively determine may be just a correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Do Symptoms Resolve?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Sanders, around 17 million Americans are thought to have long COVID. Although 90%-100% of people typically recover within 3 years, that still leaves possibly around 5% of those who don’t recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What people usually say is, ‘I got COVID, and I never quite recovered,” Sanders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Five percent of 17 million turns out to be a lot. It’s a lot of suffering,” she added. “I would say that the most common symptoms are fatigue, brain fog, anosmia or dysgeusia, and sleep disorders,” as evidenced by the high percentage of people in certain subtypes of the study reporting a poor quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 12:06:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNd1lBSVRSQ0ZpMkdMZ0wtRk9WdnJXdHNsX295VTJyRmlYWG9GXy1uREtOTEJuZDU4dWdYaTZEM2o4OEJvT0V5Q1d4ejR3d0I3cV92OGFPUTZlNlQxQVpCeWxvY1pEUGEyRHMwRnY2TzBTZEVEZnpuekUzc18wV2VCWm9ZanV0cU1JRXVQdXRCaTJ2MlZBeDZGUVBaSW11RFJOeV9Hc0tR</guid></item><item><title>Why Your Dentist May Be Able To Identify A New Alzheimer's Warning Sign - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPNXNvVmFsV1FnbUwyNFB4OC1iSW5KbnRqTjVoTVF6VnVMY29yREtkYnNRcVZ0aFk4UUxUSEh6VmhrVEVSY3VjaWdHX2YxeC1tUFNEM1cxeHdERXZyRzJsQUN3YzVWeGpIdjZEUTRVRVFSa0RrdmNKOUpQNGNWV0hwZWJJSVZPS3k2Nmt2Nm8zTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-tey52c et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Just like your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44075613/how-to-improve-gut-health/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44075613/how-to-improve-gut-health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gut" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;gut&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a63182875/vaginal-microbiome-menopause-sex/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a63182875/vaginal-microbiome-menopause-sex/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reproductive organs" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;reproductive organs&lt;/a&gt;, your mouth has its very own microbiome that plays a role in your health and wellness.

Here’s the deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the expert&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/jennifer-bramen/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/jennifer-bramen/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jennifer Bramen, PhD" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Jennifer Bramen, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, is a senior research scientist and director of neuroimaging at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/faculty/mark-s-wolff/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/faculty/mark-s-wolff/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mark S.

The participants were broken into two groups: One group had no detectable decline in brain function, while the others had mild cognitive impairment, a condition where people have more memory or thinking problems than others their age. People with mild cognitive impairment are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease or dementia, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.gov/alzheimers-dementias/mild-cognitive-impairment" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.alzheimers.gov/alzheimers-dementias/mild-cognitive-impairment" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institute on Aging" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt; (NIA). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The study participants provided the scientists with mouth rinse samples, which were then analyzed, allowing the researchers to break down the bacteria contained in each sample. The researchers discovered that certain bacteria found in the participants’ mouths were linked with having better memory and attention; Others were associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-atzu3h emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which bacteria are associated with memory and attention?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;This study found that people who had large amounts of the bacteria Neisseria and Haemophilus had better memory and attention.

The bacteria Prevotella (also commonly found in peridontel disease) was also associated with people having the gene APOE4, which is linked to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-mouth-bacteria-impact-brain-health" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does mouth bacteria impact brain health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/large-study-links-gum-disease-dementia" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/large-study-links-gum-disease-dementia" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="several" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36404545/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36404545/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="studies" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that have &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/dad2.12172" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/dad2.12172" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="linked" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; bacteria in the mouth to dementia. &lt;a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2021/april/gum-bacteria-alzheimers.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2021/april/gum-bacteria-alzheimers.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Research" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has generally suggested that having higher levels of harmful bacteria in the mouth may raise the risk of bodily inflammation, which could potentially &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; raise the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The researchers in this study theorized that harmful bacteria could get into the bloodstream and damage the brain, raising the risk of Alzheimer's disease. They also suggest that a bacterial imbalance could impact how much nitric oxide is formed from nitrate, a compound in vegetables. Nitric oxide is important for memory and communication in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But it’s hard to say for sure that the bacteria causes dementia or issues with brain health, says &lt;a href="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/faculty/mark-s-wolff/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/faculty/mark-s-wolff/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mark S.

Did one cause the other or did they just both occur because we weren't taking good care of our mouth while we were developing the Alzheimer's disease?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-i-make-sure-to-have-the-good-bacteria-in-my-mouth" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I make sure to have the “good bacteria” in my mouth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Eating a plant-based diet seems to be a good start, according to &lt;a href="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/jennifer-bramen/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/jennifer-bramen/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jennifer Bramen, PhD" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Jennifer Bramen, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a senior research scientist and director of neuroimaging at the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Adding nitrate-rich foods like veggies into your diet “can benefit the oral microbiome by promoting bacteria associated with better oral and cognitive health outcomes,” she says. This may also help to suppress bacteria that’s linked with dementia, Bramen explains.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Again, it’s hard to say at this point that these bacteria cause Alzheimer’s disease, they're just linked.

However, how we age can look very different depending on how we care for ourselves along the way. After all, healthy aging isn’t just about adding more years to your life. It’s about making those years vibrant, active and fulfilling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Healthy aging is the process of maintaining optimal physical, mental and social health and well-being as you age,” says &lt;a href="https://melissamitri.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Melissa Mitri, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and owner of Melissa Mitri Nutrition. “It not only relates to living a longer life, but enjoying a higher quality of life where you are able to remain active, cognitively strong and continue to do the things you love.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One important piece of the healthy-aging puzzle is ensuring your body gets the nutrients it needs to stay strong and resilient. While a balanced diet is the foundation, many dietitians agree that the right supplements can play a key role in supporting longevity and overall well-being. Here are their top picks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-urolithin-a"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Urolithin A &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One exciting supplement gaining attention in the world of healthy aging is urolithin A. This compound is naturally produced by certain gut bacteria when we consume foods like pomegranates, strawberries, almonds and walnuts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, not everyone’s body produces it efficiently.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Urolithin A may support longevity through its role in enhancing mitochondrial function, the powerhouses of our cells that support energy and health at the cellular level,” says Mitri. “Keeping our mitochondria in optimal shape can promote healthy aging by supporting our cells’ natural detoxification process, enabling the body to rid itself of damaged cells that can accelerate aging.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Urolithin A may also help protect against age-related muscle loss. For instance, one study found that middle-aged adults who took 500 to 1,000 milligrams of urolithin A daily for four months experienced a 10% increase in hamstring strength (or more, in some cases).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As promising as this is, research on urolithin A is relatively new. So, more study is needed before we can say if it’s really an anti-aging game-changer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-coenzyme-q10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Coenzyme Q10 &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coenzyme Q10 (or CoQ10) is an antioxidant that plays a vital role in supporting healthy aging. How so? “CoQ10 plays a key role in mitochondrial function,” says &lt;a href="https://thehormonedietitian.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Melissa Groves Azzaro, RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and founder of The Hormone Dietitian. “We produce this antioxidant in our bodies, but production declines as we age.” In fact, research has found that our body’s production of CoQ10 starts to slow down as early as age 20.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On the upside, supporting our mitochondria with antioxidants like CoQ10 may help ensure steady energy levels as we age, says Azzaro.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-magnesium-glycinate"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Magnesium Glycinate &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium glycinate is a supplement that combines the element magnesium with the amino acid glycine. This combination is believed to make its magnesium more easily absorbed by the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition to supporting energy levels and keeping inflammation in check, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; may promote better sleep, something that lots of us struggle with as we age. Sounder sleep doesn’t just make you feel rested. It’s also crucial for cellular repair.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How does magnesium help you get more shut-eye? “Magnesium helps regulate the production of melatonin, the hormone that controls your sleep-wake cycle,” says &lt;a href="https://www.jamieleerdn.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jamie Lee McIntyre, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a Florida-based registered dietitian and nutrition communications consultant.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Encouraging as this is, there aren’t any studies yet that actually prove that magnesium glycinate will help you sleep better. However, plenty of people swear by it. So, if getting your beauty rest helps you look younger, it might be worth a try.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-omega-3-fatty-acids"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Omega-3 Fatty Acids &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Omega-3s&lt;/a&gt;, particularly DHA and EPA, play a vital role in brain and heart health,” says &lt;a href="https://nomadistanutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Mascha Davis, M.P.H., RDN,&lt;/a&gt; a registered dietitian and author of &lt;em&gt;Eat Your Vitamins&lt;/em&gt;. “They reduce inflammation, improve cardiovascular function, and may even protect against cognitive decline, making them a great option for supporting healthy aging.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These hard-to-get fats are found in large quantities in fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines and herring. However, few of us eat enough fish to provide enough of these healthy fats. Enter supplements. One promising study found that volunteers who took a daily supplement containing either 1.25 grams or 2.5 grams of omega-3 fatty acids for four months were less prone to measures of aging, such as inflammation and stress, than those who took a placebo.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-vitamin-d"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is crucial for maintaining bone health and preventing osteoporosis, especially as we age,” says Davis. It also keeps your immune and nervous systems strong and healthy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research reveals that this vitamin also supports brain health by protecting brain cells from oxidative stress, potentially reducing the risk of cognitive decline as we age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Considering that many people don’t get enough sunlight or consume sufficient vitamin D–rich foods, taking a supplement can be an easy and effective way to ensure your body gets enough to stay healthy and youthful.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a Balanced Diet.&lt;/strong&gt; Eating a variety of nutrient-rich foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats, provides your body with nutrients that support graceful aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Also, don’t forget to stay hydrated. Your skin will thank you! &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active.&lt;/strong&gt; Regular physical activity, such as walking, swimming or yoga, keeps your muscles strong and joints flexible and boosts energy levels. Exercise also promotes mental well-being by reducing stress and improving mood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Sleep.&lt;/strong&gt; Quality sleep is crucial for the body to recharge and repair itself. Aim for seven to nine hours of restful sleep each night to maintain your physical and cognitive health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foster Social Connections.&lt;/strong&gt; Having a strong support system promotes emotional well-being and reduces feelings of isolation. Keep in touch with friends and family or join new social groups to keep your mind active and engaged. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice Stress Management.&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic stress can negatively impact both mental and physical health, so taking time to relax is essential. Mindfulness practices, such as meditation or deep breathing, are great ways to reduce stress. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aging is an inevitable part of life. But with the right mindset and habits, it can be a fulfilling and empowering experience. “While some factors may be out of our control when it comes to aging, eating a nutrient-dense, high-antioxidant diet and engaging in weight-bearing exercise to protect muscles and bones may help keep us stay healthy and active as we age,” says Azzaro.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you could use a little extra help, supplements like urolithin A, CoQ10, magnesium glycinate, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D may offer additional support. However, these are only one piece of the anti-aging puzzle and are not a magic bullet. If you choose to use these—or any supplements—consult your health care provider to make sure they are a good fit for your unique health needs.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have some news to share with all of you this morning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have been together for a long time and I have shared a lot with you over the years. Unfortunately ,I have some difficult news to tell you about.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I recently found out that I have prostate cancer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luckily, we found it early and it is curable. But I need to attend to it and get better so I can be back to where I belong with my “GO!” team and all of you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will be out for a period of time recovering -- hopefully quickly -- and when I get back, I plan to share my journey with all of you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trust me, I will be excited to get back to normal and get back to the routine as soon as I can.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tough to share, but it is what it is. And I’ll be back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave also had this message for 3News' Danita Harris and Matt Wintz:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I appreciate you guys more than you know," he told them. "I appreciate everything you’ve done so far through the journey. I’ll be thinking about you, and I’ll be updating everyone as we go along, but I will be back. This is where I love to be.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danita told Dave the "GO!" family "will be with you every step of the way."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We love you and care about you," she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt added: "Not only do we have your back, we have you through prayer, which is a powerful thing that can get stuff done around here. We’ll support you every step."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Chan School of Public Health in Boston and others based in Chicago, Perth and Copenhagen, set out to discover if a flavonoid-rich diet impacted measures of healthy ageing, notably frailty levels, physical function and mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;To do that, scientists examined data from two large studies, the Nurses’ Health Study (1990–2014) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (2006-2018), which followed 62,743 females and 23,687 males, all aged 60 or over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Ageing, on a biological level, is the result of an accumulation of damage to cells and tissues that leads to a gradual decline in physical and mental capacities, increased susceptibility to diseases and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Although life expectancy has been increasing in many developed countries including Ireland – where male life expectancy, as measured in 2021, now stands at 80.5 years for men and 84.3 years for women – the proportion of years people can expect to stay in good health has not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;Scientists are keen to establish the factors that determine healthy ageing so that people can aim to increase the number of years where they are free of illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;The study participants with the highest ‘flavodiet’ scores – who had higher intakes of red wine, tea, apples, blueberries and oranges – were found to have lower risk of age-related poor health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;The scientists compared those with highest flavodiet scores to those with the lowest. The former group were found to benefit across all three measures of healthy ageing. They had a 15 per cent lower risk of frailty, a 12 per cent lower risk of impaired physical function and a 12 per cent lower risk of poor mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;This study adds to growing evidence that flavonoids improve heart health and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph paywall"&gt;“Studies suggest they reduce inflammation, improve our lipid and blood pressure levels, improve blood vessel function, improve glucose control and have neuroprotective effects,” said Prof Cassidy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Irish Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 11:53:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3gFBVV95cUxNWVBRMmZIWmNUNmhHdVVEb1g4Ykw1NnhsUllVY1ZQdTJuZU5mQUN0QWZiY2ZQclJORmx5VXYwcDV2MTE2TUJDWkV4X0ZOXzI5dWo1dlM2Z1BVMWdzckd6ZHcxbEo4TnJBQk5uc1d5R0VzcVFudXVWYlVVQ0hwOXBDeGc1cjlMOVdPbnhDazI5SlV3ZWpPblZFaDJhVVRrM0NRTjZHTnNZbUNXTDlONFRva2JSY2ZZT28xWTdtME5XcjhNR3R0bEZHc0lBTkdzTk5RbVFsQ0xhek5GZDBYSGc</guid></item><item><title>26 Photos Of The Wildest And Dumbest Things Moms Have Actually Posted In Online Mom Groups - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE9ZMjBlTlpMeGg1aEF6cUhTZXpzdHlaUDBua2VPVW84c2F3Wl9pRTRJRHN4bElZTWNibXhDT29nS08zQnYtc04zeFE1N0tIMlJQWWVCdlRPMXE0SlY3c2xZZlFfVEFKdGgw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="headline_container__AwL7p  embed-headline"&gt;&lt;h1 class="headline_title__NbsAE embed-headline-title"&gt;26 Photos Of The Wildest And Dumbest Things Moms Have Actually Posted In Online Mom Groups &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="headline_description__xYhEI embed-headline-description"&gt;"OMG, I would rather let my baby eat dog food off the floor (which he's done a few times) than use soap on him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BuzzFeed</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 11:31:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE9ZMjBlTlpMeGg1aEF6cUhTZXpzdHlaUDBua2VPVW84c2F3Wl9pRTRJRHN4bElZTWNibXhDT29nS08zQnYtc04zeFE1N0tIMlJQWWVCdlRPMXE0SlY3c2xZZlFfVEFKdGgw</guid></item><item><title>Mysterious brain activity in dying patients sparks debate over consciousness and the soul - Dimsum Daily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxONnc4cXhhT2pBY25xdXN3ZHBGUjBMUDVnTHpNTUxGLWpLUlNXWkpiZHd1dkMyNHZtMzFyM0V4ZWhRNnJIajZjWWdScnRWa3RnOXNCMnFER3UydWxULXBTcWJBMGZFUzR6c2hYbk56YTRfT0pMN0FpZG5RclpUb3VMeGRDYXhJal9UeDA1MFViTVl2UF9oSTA4dWxQM3ozTmxxalEzc3ZUYXVBVHc2WDJZVU5ZQTY0U2JQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content tagdiv-type"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;20th February 2025 – (Arizona) A recent study monitoring the brain activity of a clinically dead patient has revealed a mysterious burst of energy, reigniting debates over the nature of consciousness and the possibility of the soul leaving the body after death. Dr. Stuart Hameroff, an anaesthesiologist and professor at the University of Arizona, described the phenomenon as a sudden spike in gamma synchrony—a brain wave pattern associated with awareness and perception—detected by an electroencephalogram (EEG).&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“They saw everything go away, and then [psh], you got this activity when there was no blood pressure, no heart rate,” Dr. Hameroff explained in an interview with Project Unity. “So that could be the near-death experience, or it could be the soul leaving the body, perhaps.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The activity, which lasted between 30 to 90 seconds, occurred after the patient was declared clinically dead. While sceptics argue it could be the “last gasp” of neurons firing or an illusion, Dr. Hameroff suggests it may indicate consciousness persisting at a deeper, low-energy level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings echo earlier research by Dr. Lakhmir Chawla, who pioneered EEG monitoring of brain-dead patients to ensure no brain activity before organ donation. Dr. Hameroff noted that such bursts of activity are reproducible, occurring in about 50% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hameroff also referenced a study by Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris, where volunteers given psilocybin reported vivid hallucinations despite showing minimal brain activity on MRI scans. This, he speculates, could point to consciousness operating at a quantum level within neurons—a theory that challenges traditional neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think consciousness is actually low energy,” Dr. Hameroff concluded, suggesting it may be “the last thing to go” during the dying process.&lt;/p&gt;

Fever, along with coughing and sore throat, is one of the main features of the flu, and yet this common symptom is surrounded by myths. “It’s definitely a time of year when we hear more of these myths,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/family-medicine/ca/santa-monica/david-cutler-1255368338" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. David Cutler;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. David Cutler&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist in family medicine at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., tells Yahoo Life. “Not a week goes by that I’m not answering or clearing up questions about what a fever is, what to do about it or what having a fever means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These are the biggest myths about fevers that doctors say they’d like to set straight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no1-a-normal-body-temperature-is-986-degrees"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 1: Normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Technically, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/average-body-temperature-no-longer-163811445.html" data-ylk="slk:that’s not true;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;that’s not true&lt;/a&gt;, although there is plenty of confusion about this. “There is a complex discussion about what is a normal body temperature,” Cutler says. While most people think of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit as being the baseline for everyone, that number was &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/400116" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:established decades;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;established decades&lt;/a&gt; ago by a German physician who took millions of temperatures to come up with an average. But more recent research suggests that &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2809098" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:people can have various temperatures;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;people can have various temperatures&lt;/a&gt; when they’re healthy — and that 97.9 might be a more accurate average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="md:hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto mb-5 flex flex-col overflow-hidden rounded-xl pb-5 shadow-[0_0_1px_rgba(200,160,251,.63),0_2px_6px_1px_#F3E6FE]"&gt;&lt;h3 class="m-auto block px-4 pb-4 pt-2 text-lg font-bold leading-6"&gt;Trusted news and daily delights, right in your inbox&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="m-auto px-4 pb-4 text-sm font-normal"&gt;See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In general, the medical community recognizes a fever as any temperature at or above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/henry-young-md-137421" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Henry Young;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Henry Young&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor in the department of emergency medicine at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells Yahoo Life. But if you have a normal body temperature that tends to be lower than 98.6, you may have feverish symptoms below 100.4, Cutler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no2-feed-a-cold-starve-a-fever"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 2: Feed a cold, starve a fever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you have a fever but feel like eating, Young says it’s important to continue to fuel your body. “‘Starving’ a fever can be dangerous as, when you are ill, your body requires calories to continue to function and to fight the infection,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That said, it’s OK if you aren’t very hungry when you have a fever, &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. William Schaffner,;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. “The important thing is to keep up your fluids,” he says. “You can lose body fluids by sweating when you have a fever, and you may not even realize that you’re sweating.” He suggests focusing on water, sports drinks and fruit juices, and avoiding drinks with alcohol and caffeine, which can cause you to lose more fluid than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no3-fevers-are-inherently-dangerous"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 3: Fevers are inherently dangerous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Having a fever isn’t fun, but it’s evidence that your body is doing the right thing. “Fever is a sign that your body is working to fight an infection and can be a good sign that your immune system is working,” Young says. “Fevers can slow the growth of a virus or bacteria in our bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most fevers are not inherently dangerous, Schaffner says. The exception is when temperatures spike to extremely high numbers, like 105 or 106 degrees, he says. “Then, indeed, you can have problems,” and seeking medical attention is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no4-fever-reducing-medications-will-help-you-get-better"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 4: Fever-reducing medications will help you get better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Taking an over-the-counter medication like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help you feel better in the moment. “But it is not going to actually kill the virus or bacteria causing the infection,” Young says. Instead, these medications can be helpful in treating the symptoms linked with a fever like body aches, chills, sweats and fatigue, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These medications can help you to feel more comfortable while you ride it out,” Schaffner explains. “If the fever is caused by something like an influenza infection, those medications won’t do anything for the virus itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no5-you-need-to-call-a-doctor-every-time-you-have-a-fever"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 5: You need to call a doctor every time you have a fever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Not necessarily. If you feel uncomfortable but are able to get your symptoms under control with the help of fever-reducing medications, Schaffner says, there’s no need to call a doctor. But if your fever lingers for several days, makes you feel debilitated or confused or you have no idea what could be causing your lingering fever, it’s time to be seen by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s also necessary to contact a health care provider sooner if the patient is in a vulnerable group. “For some individuals, fevers can be more serious than for others — particularly the very young, the very old or individuals with a weakened immune system,” Young says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no6-no-touch-thermometers-are-as-accurate-as-gold-standard-oral-ones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 6: No-touch thermometers are as accurate as gold-standard oral ones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No-touch thermometers have been around for years, but they became massively popular during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. While these thermometers can tell your temperature, research suggests they’re &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11046542/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:generally not as good;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;generally not as good&lt;/a&gt; at giving an &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99300-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:accurate reading;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;accurate reading&lt;/a&gt; as oral thermometers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That doesn’t mean you can’t use one of these though. “The no-touch thermometers are appealing because they can be faster and allow a greater distance between the sick individual and the person collecting the temperature,” Young says. They’re also easier to use with young children, who tend to reject putting a thermometer in their mouth, he points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The key thing is that you have to &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/media/pdfs/2024/05/How-to-Use-an-Infrared-Thermometer-ENGLISH-508.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:use them correctly;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;use them correctly&lt;/a&gt;,” Schaffner says. (That means following the manufacturer’s instructions carefully.)

If you have a lower fever and you feel generally OK, Schaffner says you don’t need to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But if you have a fever and feel lousy, taking an over-the-counter medication like ibuprofen or acetaminophen may help you feel better and even bring the fever down, he says. Still, Young says that fevers won’t necessarily continue to go up if you don’t treat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you have a fever, Schaffner recommends doing your best to stay well hydrated. “Try to rest and be alert to see whatever else is happening in your body,” he says. “If someone else is going on, that’s a signal to seek medical attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 11:00:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNanNlTUxHOTVoR01YY0dMZHpta25JcTBsYm9kQU53TkxjdGFPazN0Z2xLemdBY3BUclVEeDhiN2RFaUN0djMzSUNhaE1lamZUdHBvYmFId2Nram5NWlNLQVVFcGo0YjBoVF9zLVREM1ZMT3MydFl3cjB2WHJ6X2tzdkdFU2xEQzg0eHBPdldlcS14OWhzU0tPWEgwMlBnYUdheTdYNw</guid></item><item><title>Doctors set the record straight on 7 common fever myths - Yahoo Life</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNbzdFVHVYX1E0cmlsSVkxX1pMdldSUG44LU9Xd01QOFdDTm5vSDZNcEJYeFFxcFR0d0trSERRNUNkcmFfdDRQVzFzRFVuSEZjdUkyUWpvR3dSOG8xVlJQbE93cEhlNllZV3lqQW16OXE3a1BsdkU0bjBpeHNXM3p6d3ln?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/flu-levels-are-the-highest-theyve-been-since-2009-the-cdc-says-the-latest-on-winter-illnesses-including-rsv-covid-19-and-more-152406954.html" data-ylk="slk:a lot of flu cases;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;a lot of flu cases&lt;/a&gt; right now — at least &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/worst-flu-season-influenza-virus-spread-new-bird-flu-cases-us-plus#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20latest%20CDC,the%202009%2D2010%20flu%20season." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:29 million;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;29 million&lt;/a&gt; so far this season, making this the worst flu season the U.S. has seen in nearly a decade, according to data from the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-06.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Fever, along with coughing and sore throat, is one of the main features of the flu, and yet this common symptom is surrounded by myths. “It’s definitely a time of year when we hear more of these myths,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/family-medicine/ca/santa-monica/david-cutler-1255368338" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. David Cutler;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. David Cutler&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist in family medicine at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., tells Yahoo Life. “Not a week goes by that I’m not answering or clearing up questions about what a fever is, what to do about it or what having a fever means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These are the biggest myths about fevers that doctors say they’d like to set straight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no1-a-normal-body-temperature-is-986-degrees"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 1: Normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Technically, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/average-body-temperature-no-longer-163811445.html" data-ylk="slk:that’s not true;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;that’s not true&lt;/a&gt;, although there is plenty of confusion about this. “There is a complex discussion about what is a normal body temperature,” Cutler says. While most people think of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit as being the baseline for everyone, that number was &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/400116" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:established decades;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;established decades&lt;/a&gt; ago by a German physician who took millions of temperatures to come up with an average. But more recent research suggests that &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2809098" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:people can have various temperatures;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;people can have various temperatures&lt;/a&gt; when they’re healthy — and that 97.9 might be a more accurate average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="md:hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto mb-5 flex flex-col overflow-hidden rounded-xl pb-5 shadow-[0_0_1px_rgba(200,160,251,.63),0_2px_6px_1px_#F3E6FE]"&gt;&lt;h3 class="m-auto block px-4 pb-4 pt-2 text-lg font-bold leading-6"&gt;Trusted news and daily delights, right in your inbox&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="m-auto px-4 pb-4 text-sm font-normal"&gt;See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In general, the medical community recognizes a fever as any temperature at or above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/henry-young-md-137421" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Henry Young;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Henry Young&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor in the department of emergency medicine at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells Yahoo Life. But if you have a normal body temperature that tends to be lower than 98.6, you may have feverish symptoms below 100.4, Cutler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no2-feed-a-cold-starve-a-fever"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 2: Feed a cold, starve a fever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you have a fever but feel like eating, Young says it’s important to continue to fuel your body. “‘Starving’ a fever can be dangerous as, when you are ill, your body requires calories to continue to function and to fight the infection,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That said, it’s OK if you aren’t very hungry when you have a fever, &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. William Schaffner,;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. “The important thing is to keep up your fluids,” he says. “You can lose body fluids by sweating when you have a fever, and you may not even realize that you’re sweating.” He suggests focusing on water, sports drinks and fruit juices, and avoiding drinks with alcohol and caffeine, which can cause you to lose more fluid than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no3-fevers-are-inherently-dangerous"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 3: Fevers are inherently dangerous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Having a fever isn’t fun, but it’s evidence that your body is doing the right thing. “Fever is a sign that your body is working to fight an infection and can be a good sign that your immune system is working,” Young says. “Fevers can slow the growth of a virus or bacteria in our bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most fevers are not inherently dangerous, Schaffner says. The exception is when temperatures spike to extremely high numbers, like 105 or 106 degrees, he says. “Then, indeed, you can have problems,” and seeking medical attention is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no4-fever-reducing-medications-will-help-you-get-better"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 4: Fever-reducing medications will help you get better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Taking an over-the-counter medication like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help you feel better in the moment. “But it is not going to actually kill the virus or bacteria causing the infection,” Young says. Instead, these medications can be helpful in treating the symptoms linked with a fever like body aches, chills, sweats and fatigue, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These medications can help you to feel more comfortable while you ride it out,” Schaffner explains. “If the fever is caused by something like an influenza infection, those medications won’t do anything for the virus itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no5-you-need-to-call-a-doctor-every-time-you-have-a-fever"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 5: You need to call a doctor every time you have a fever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Not necessarily. If you feel uncomfortable but are able to get your symptoms under control with the help of fever-reducing medications, Schaffner says, there’s no need to call a doctor. But if your fever lingers for several days, makes you feel debilitated or confused or you have no idea what could be causing your lingering fever, it’s time to be seen by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s also necessary to contact a health care provider sooner if the patient is in a vulnerable group. “For some individuals, fevers can be more serious than for others — particularly the very young, the very old or individuals with a weakened immune system,” Young says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no6-no-touch-thermometers-are-as-accurate-as-gold-standard-oral-ones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 6: No-touch thermometers are as accurate as gold-standard oral ones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No-touch thermometers have been around for years, but they became massively popular during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. While these thermometers can tell your temperature, research suggests they’re &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11046542/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:generally not as good;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;generally not as good&lt;/a&gt; at giving an &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99300-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:accurate reading;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;accurate reading&lt;/a&gt; as oral thermometers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That doesn’t mean you can’t use one of these though. “The no-touch thermometers are appealing because they can be faster and allow a greater distance between the sick individual and the person collecting the temperature,” Young says. They’re also easier to use with young children, who tend to reject putting a thermometer in their mouth, he points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The key thing is that you have to &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/media/pdfs/2024/05/How-to-Use-an-Infrared-Thermometer-ENGLISH-508.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:use them correctly;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;use them correctly&lt;/a&gt;,” Schaffner says. (That means following the manufacturer’s instructions carefully.) Schaffner suggests getting a few readings with a no-touch thermometer to see how consistent they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="myth-no7-all-fevers-need-to-be-treated"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth No. 7: All fevers need to be treated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A fever is a sign that your body is fighting off an infection, Schaffner says. “But there’s a distinction between the cause of the fever and the fever itself,” he says.

It’s a cruel irony, then, that many of us who make it that far will begin to lose our sense of who we are due to dementia. If you’re 65, you’ve got about a one in 20 chance of developing the most common form, Alzheimer’s disease, in the next decade. At 75, it’s about one in seven, while those fortunate enough to reach 85 face a one in three chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Given the toll this illness takes on sufferers and those around them, hundreds of millions of families around the world are desperate for a medical breakthrough – and for years, headlines have suggested that it might be imminent.

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The subtitle of Doctored – Fraud, Arrogance and Tragedy in the Quest to Cure Alzheimer’s &lt;em&gt;– &lt;/em&gt;serves as a spoiler as to how that story ends, at least for the moment. The fraud uncovered by a rag-tag group of researchers into academic integrity and extensively documented here by Charles Piller, an investigative journalist for the magazine Science, feels like the kind of scandal that should have had wall-to-wall coverage. And yet, outside scientific circles, it remains relatively low-profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The story is complicated, but a summary might go like this: for decades, something called the amyloid hypothesis has dominated research into Alzheimer’s, determining how billions of dollars of public and private funding into new drugs was spent. The brains of people who had died with it showed clumps of sticky protein – called amyloid plaques – between neurons. It seemed logical that these might be responsible for the disease’s symptoms. And while this became the main line of inquiry, it never quite delivered on its early promise. Many people with amyloid plaques didn’t have signs of Alzheimer’s, for example. Something seemed to be missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;And then came what seemed like decisive proof: a 2006 paper from the University of Minnesota, which went on to become one of the most cited in the field, showed that a sub-type of amyloid led to memory impairment. It wasn’t until 2022 that scientific sleuths &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/23/alzheimers-study-fraudulent" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that key images on which the research relied might have been Photoshopped to better fit the hypothesis. At first, the scientists fought back against the claims, but the 2006 paper has now been &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04533" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;retracted&lt;/a&gt;, as have others based around the same findings. As the book explains, investigations continue and several key figures involved deny any knowledge of wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Doctored is clearly the result of brilliant and dogged journalism, but at times all of this work is easier to admire than read&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The implication is that years of work and billions of dollars spent on Alzheimer’s research may have been carried out on the basis of fraudulent evidence. The scale of the harm caused and damage done is likely to be incalculable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Piller handles the difficult material patiently and meticulously, as you would expect of an experienced specialist reporter. As the book continues, it becomes an ever more uncomfortable read: the tale starts with the alleged fakery of images by one, or a handful, of scientists. By the end, we’re left wondering if any research can really be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Doctored is clearly the result of brilliant and dogged journalism, but at times all of this work is easier to admire than it is to read. Piller tries to humanise his narrative with pen portraits of key figures, but his habit of doing several of these in a row – and formulaically telling us everyone’s place of birth and what their parents and grandparents did – gets repetitive and frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-9" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Discover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

								&lt;p&gt;Dr. Matt Teegarden likes to compare apples to &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/apples"&gt;apples&lt;/a&gt;. Or, at the very least, he wants studies on &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/07/01/should-we-be-afraid-of-ultra-processed-foods-its-complicated/"&gt;ultra-processed foods &lt;/a&gt;to compare apples to applesauce—not just apples to orange juice. That distinction, he argued in a Wednesday seminar hosted by the &lt;a href="https://www.ift.org/"&gt;Institute of Food Technologists&lt;/a&gt;, is crucial in parsing the &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/nutrition"&gt;nutritional &lt;/a&gt;complexity of modern food processing. As it stands, many of the most-cited studies on the topic conflate categories in ways that obscure rather than illuminate the role of processing in nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation around ultra-processed foods (UPFs) has accelerated in recent years, with public health advocates and consumers alike turning to the NOVA classification system to decode the complexities of modern food production. But Teegarden, a food scientist and chemist, alongside Dr. Susanne Bügel, a professor at the University of Copenhagen, suggests that the system is oversimplified, failing to account for the nuances of nutrition, formulation and processing methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NOVA system — &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which was developed in the early 2000s by researchers at the University of São Paulo, led by Brazilian nutritionist Carlos Monteiro — classifies foods into four categories: unprocessed or minimally processed foods, like fresh fruit and vegetables; processed culinary ingredients, like &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/01/19/youre-using-olive-oil-the-way-heres-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;oils&lt;/a&gt; and sugars; processed foods, such as canned vegetables or tinned fish; and ultra-processed foods, which include packaged snacks, sodas and flavored yogurts. The issue, Teegarden pointed out, is that the system treats vastly different foods as nutritionally equivalent simply because they undergo a similar level of processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A loaf of whole wheat bread, for instance, can be classified as either a category 2 or a category 4 food, depending on the production method. The same goes for yogurt and &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/01/23/youre-only-3-ingredients-and-10-minutes-away-from-the-herbiest-bean-soup-ever/"&gt;canned beans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If beans are just canned in water and a little bit of salt, that would be group three,” Teerfarden said. “But if maybe they have EDTA [ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid] added for color retention, that would be seen as a cosmetic additive, and they would be group four, even though they're virtually the same product.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bügel is leading an initiative aimed at refining this approach. Her team is working on a classification system that integrates processing methods with nutritional content, providing a more holistic view of a food’s health impact. She points out that foods like mass-produced packaged breads, breakfast &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/11/07/revisiting-millsberry-the-wild-rise-and-fall-of-general-mills-virtual-cereal-themed-town/"&gt;cereals&lt;/a&gt; and fruit yogurts are classified as ultra-processed under the NOVA system, yet despite this classification, these products still offer significant nutritional value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very difficult to use [the NOVA system], both for the professionals and for the consumers,” she said. “For the professionals, we have to guess whether people are eating bread bought in a supermarket or bread bought in a bakery. It’s absolutely not based on scientific evidence.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oversimplifications of the NOVA system become even more apparent when examining epidemiological studies linking UPFs to negative health outcomes. Many rely on dietary recall data, a notoriously unreliable metric, and don’t necessarily track food consumption with processing levels in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Importantly with NOVA, the data that’s been collected in a lot of the studies that have been published thus far, the data is not necessarily collected with processing in mind,” Teergarden said. “In fact, a lot of the data was collected before NOVA was even invented. We have a lot of historical data here. So the processing levels of the foods in these dietary surveys are actually implied.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That imprecision, coupled with the broad category definitions, has led to some dubious findings. One study, Teegarden pointed out, found a correlation between UPF consumption and accidental death — a statistical oddity that likely indicates residual confounding rather than causation. “So be careful if you’re eating a &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/candy"&gt;candy bar &lt;/a&gt;and walking under an air conditioning unit,” he joked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other studies, while more rigorous, still struggle with the challenge of isolating processing as an independent health factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the gold standard for nutritional research is the randomized controlled trial, which allows scientists to isolate specific dietary variables. Only a handful of such studies exist on UPFs, but they do suggest that ultra-processed diets may encourage overeating. However, Teegarden argues that even these studies lack crucial nuance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My issue here as a food scientist is that we're not testing whether or not making something ultra-processed is causing these effects."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for instance, a recent study conducted in Japan. On the first day, participants assigned to the ultra-processed diet were given fried chicken, biscuits and a giant bowl of sweetened yogurt. Meanwhile, the minimally processed diet featured rice, vegetables and lean protein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My issue here as a food scientist is that we're not testing whether or not making something ultra-processed is causing these effects,” he said. “We're testing these overall dietary patterns. So we're missing the buck a little bit here because we've controlled for nutrient content, but we haven't controlled for food type.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that all ultra-processed foods are inherently unhealthy ignores an inconvenient truth: Some UPFs contribute meaningfully to a balanced diet. Fortified cereals provide essential micronutrients, plant-based milks cater to those with dairy intolerances and some packaged breads offer whole grains that many people wouldn’t otherwise consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal, according to both Teegarden and Bügel, shouldn’t be to demonize processing as a concept, but rather to refine how we assess its impact on health. A smarter classification system — one that accounts for processing, formulation and nutrition — could help public health officials provide more accurate dietary guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, the conversation about ultra-processed foods remains muddied, shaped more by broad-strokes panic than by the scientific precision it deserves. And if we want to truly understand the role of processing in modern diets, we need to move beyond comparing apples to orange juice — and start comparing apples to applesauce.&lt;/p&gt;

"I never thought twice about it," says Hill, now a researcher who teaches evolutionary psychology at Texas Christian University, an institution affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in the United States. It was only when she switched contraceptives, 12 years after starting to take the pill, that an epiphany dawned on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"My life felt brighter and more interesting, like I had walked out of a 2D black-and-white movie into a full-colour, 3D, meaning-filled reality," says Hill. Her experiences of taking oral contraceptives inspired her to study the science involved and publish a book, &lt;i id="how-the-pill-changes-everything" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;How the Pill Changes Everything&lt;/i&gt;, in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In addition to discussing legitimate concerns, social media influencers have been &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-66671765" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;spreading misinformation&lt;/a&gt; about the contraceptive pill's side effects, both mental and physical. While they may have no medical background, some are even encouraging women to abandon contraception altogether – a trend which some experts believe could be behind a recent spike in &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cnvjl27rrjzo" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;abortions in the UK&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But can the pill really alter one's personality and outlook on life? Can it contribute to serious mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression, or even lead to suicide, in extreme cases?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;&lt;span id="a-slow-response" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="a-slow-response" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;A slow response&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The answer, it appears, isn't clear-cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;When the pill made its debut in the US in 1960, it &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/history-oral-contraception/2000-06#:~:text=The%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration,as%20it%20is%20popularly%20known." class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;amassed a whopping 1.2 million users&lt;/a&gt; within two years.

First, there's the most popular kind, the combined pill, which contains synthetic versions of oestrogen and progesterone. The other is the progestogen-only pill, or "mini-pill". Both work to prevent pregnancy &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://111.wales.nhs.uk/combinedcontraceptivepill/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;in a handful of ways&lt;/a&gt;, including suppressing ovulation and thickening the cervical mucus to make it harder for a sperm to penetrate and reach an egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;However, the hormones in oral contraceptives don't just affect the body, they can also have powerful effects on women's brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ksfnd0.jpg.webp" alt="Dempsey Ewan There’s some evidence that the contraceptive pill can be harmful to women’s mental health – but how exactly this works remains unclear (Credit: Dempsey Ewan)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 fxQYxK"&gt;Dempsey Ewan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;There’s some evidence that the contraceptive pill can be harmful to women’s mental health – but how exactly this works remains unclear (Credit: Dempsey Ewan)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"The impact of hormones on the brain is complicated," says Johannes Bitzer, an obstetrician-gynaecologist (OBGYN) and psychotherapist at the University Hospital Basel in Switzerland. "For some individuals, the pill has a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39424518/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;positive effect on mental well-being&lt;/a&gt;. In others, it may cause irritation and even anxiety." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Medical warnings, for the most part of the pill's &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15984258" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;65-year history&lt;/a&gt;, have been scant. Some sexual health providers in the UK and the US make no mention whatsoever of the mental side effects of the pill on their websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"I think the big issue is that in OBGYN training, mental health is not a subject. It's for the psychiatrists," says Bitzer, who has been in the field for nearly 40 years. Things are slowly changing, but "before, when we discussed the pill, we talked about thrombosis, cancer, irregular bleeding, weight gain, and so on. The issue of mental health was more or less excluded," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;There hadn't been much investigation into potential mental side effects from researchers, either. But a shift started taking place in 2016, says Bitzer, when a group from Denmark published a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27680324/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;seminal paper&lt;/a&gt; on the topic, leading to more research in the years after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In the original Danish study, researchers dug into the country's national health database to track the mental health of over a million women aged between 15 and 34 over a period of 14 years. They discovered that women who started taking the combined pill were 70% more likely to be prescribed antidepressants six months later, as compared to those who had never taken oral contraceptives. For those starting on the mini-pill, the risk was 80%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In 2023, a separate group of researchers gleaned &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37303201/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;similar results&lt;/a&gt; when they analysed the health records of a quarter of a million women in the UK Biobank, a large repository of genetic and medical information. Pill-users, they found, were 71% more likely to be depressed compared with never-users, two years after beginning their contraceptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"There's a convincing temporal association between starting use of these products and then developing depression symptoms," says Øjvind Lidegaard, a medical epidemiologist specialising in obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Copenhagen, who led the Danish study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;However, both of these studies were "cohort studies", conducted by analysing the data of large groups of women, and comparing the mental health outcomes of those who were taking oral contraceptives with those who weren’t. This means they were able to identify if there was an association between these two things, but not unravel whether there was cause and effect. There could, for example, be some pre-existing differences between the groups of women that affect the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;&lt;span id="conflicting-results" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="conflicting-results" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Conflicting results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Some studies seem to contradict the correlation between certain mental health conditions and oral contraceptive use. For instance, when researchers at Ohio State University &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29496297/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;reviewed 26 earlier studies&lt;/a&gt;, they found only a "minimal" link between progestogen-only methods of contraception and depression. Separately, in two clinical trials, each involving between 200 and 340 women in Sweden, researchers concluded that the combined pill &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28433366/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;didn't lead to depression&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27923181/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;worsening mood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Intriguingly, taking a "break" from oral contraceptives – as is required for seven days each month with many types of the combined pill – can lead to mood worsening, according to some findings. In a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37755829/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; involving 120 pill-taking women in Austria, some of whom were long-term users, participants reported feeling a 7% increase in anxiety during their pill pause, as well as a 13% and 24% rise in negative feelings and mental health symptoms, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;"So from a mental health perspective, it might be more beneficial for contraceptive users to go for continuous use," says Belinda Pletzer, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Salzburg, who is leading an EU-funded &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.europeandissemination.eu/becontra/11695" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; to study the effect of hormonal contraceptives on the female brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Pletzer doesn't discount the fact that some women do suffer poorly, psychologically speaking, when on the pill, and that these symptoms should be taken seriously. "But it's just a small percentage of women," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;One reason to explain the vast discrepancy in study findings on the mental side-effects of oral contraceptives is quite simply the nature of what's at hand, says Helena Kopp Kallner, an OBGYN at Danderyd Hospital near Stockholm in Sweden. Namely, that mental health conditions are often measured subjectively, and are notoriously difficult to study. Add to that that there are many different pill types (&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/combination-birth-control-pills" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;over 30 brands of the combined pill exist&lt;/a&gt;), so often scientists might end up comparing apples to oranges, she says. The different studies also use varying methodologies, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ksfngj.jpg.webp" alt='Dempsey Ewan One study found that taking the seven day "break" recommended for some contraceptive pills could make women feel worse (Credit: Dempsey Ewan)' class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 fxQYxK"&gt;Dempsey Ewan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 cvNhQw"&gt;One study found that taking the seven day "break" recommended for some contraceptive pills could make women feel worse (Credit: Dempsey Ewan)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;What researchers look for at the end of their study also affects their findings, adds Bitzer. In the Danish study, for instance, "the fact that you get prescribed antidepressants is not necessarily related to a diagnosis of depression, but to the practice of the doctor, which makes your outcome measure quite problematic", he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;It's also hard to prove cause-and-effect relationships from such observational studies, says Sofia Zettermark, a physician based in Gothenburg, Sweden, because there could be other factors – such as genetics and one's environment – that may influence the results. For example, when she analysed the health records of nearly a million women in the national Swedish registries, she discovered that women from low-income and immigrant backgrounds &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/10/e049553.long" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;were more sensitive&lt;/a&gt; to experiencing mood changes on hormonal contraception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Lidegaard, for his part, clarifies that his study must be understood in the wider context. "There's no doubt that some women who start using hormonal contraception experience severe changes in their mental health," says Lidegaard. "However, it's important to realise that it's only 7 to 8% who face so many mental incidences that they are forced to stop taking their medication...The majority of women taking these products don't feel any severe discomfort mentally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;And of course, for some women the benefits of oral contraceptives may outweigh any side-effects. In addition to providing highly effective contraception, the combined and mini-pill can have other positive physical effects. "If you have &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/endometriosis/#:~:text=Medicines%20are%20often%20the%20first,these%20can%20help%20ease%20pain" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/choosing-contraception/effects-on-periods/#:~:text=Methods%20of%20contraception%20that%20can%20help%20with%20heavy%20periods%20are,progestogen%2Donly%20pill" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;heavy bleeding&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(21)00774-2/pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;PMDD&lt;/a&gt; [premenstrual dysphoric disorder, an extreme and debilitating form of PMS], then the pill can actually help improve it," says Kopp Kallner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Pregnancy itself can also involve significant health complications, particularly in the developing world. Meanwhile, several studies have found a link between &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9072423/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20several%20studies%20have%20confirmed,during%20the%20course%20of%20pregnancy." class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;unplanned pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and a higher risk of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;&lt;span id="altering-brain-chemistry" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="altering-brain-chemistry" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Altering brain chemistry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;But where there are impacts on mental health, how exactly does this happen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;There are many ways that oral contraceptives might be able to interfere with women's moods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Instead, combined and mini-pills, as well as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), contain synthetic versions of these hormones which disrupt the natural progression of the menstrual cycle. This includes progestins, a group of artificial progestogen hormones that can be manufactured in a variety of ways, though the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563211/#:~:text=The%20testosterone%20derivatives%20are%20the,norethindrone%20acetate%2C%20ethynodiol%20diacetate%2C%20norethynodrel" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;majority are made from testosterone&lt;/a&gt;. Neither synthetic oestrogens or progestins are chemically identical to the hormones naturally produced by the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;This is thought to have a number of consequences. One is that, in women who are taking the contraceptive pill, pathways involving the neurotransmitter serotonin – which is often described as the brain's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/serotonin-the-natural-mood-booster" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;natural "mood-booster"&lt;/a&gt; – might be disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In one study, a group of Danish researchers analysed brain scans of 53 healthy women, 16 of which were taking oral contraceptive pills, to assess the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7586815/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;activity of the serotonin system&lt;/a&gt;. They found that the women using oral contraceptives had 9-12% lower levels of a certain type of serotonin signalling compared to the women who were not taking these drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;The effect was twice as large as the impact that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are known to have on this particular kind of signalling. The researchers speculated that this might be the mechanism responsible for the link between oral contraceptives and depression.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;There's also some evidence that the artificial oestrogen and progestins present in oral contraceptives might interfere with the production of allopregnanolone, another hormone with crucial roles in the brain – particularly the regulation of mood and the body's stress response. A pharmaceutical version of this hormone was approved in the US in 2019 for the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352289519300505" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;treatment of post-natal depression&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In women who are not taking artificial sex hormones, progesterone can be converted into allopregnanolone. But in women using the contraceptive pill, this process is thought to be disrupted: progestins don't get broken down into allopregnanolone, meaning they may miss out on some of its anti-anxiety and antidepressant effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In one study conducted in rats, those taking oral contraceptives had &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091305712001463" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;lower concentrations of allopregnanolone in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.

"What researchers have found is that you get a blunting of the cortisol response to stress that most naturally cycling women experience," explains Hill. "No cortisol equals no stress, which might sound like a good thing on the surface. But that's not how it works – cortisol isn't what causes stress, it's how our body helps cope with and recover from stress." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla"&gt;&lt;span id="adolescent-risk" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="adolescent-risk" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Adolescent risk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;There's one group in particular that Lidegaard worries about: teenage girls. His study revealed that those aged between 15 and 19 were almost twice as likely (1.8 times) to receive an antidepressant prescription after starting the combined pill compared to those who did not take the pill. For those on the mini-pill, the risk was more than double (this group was 2.2 times more likely to be prescribed antidepressants than those who did not take the pill).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Similarly, Zettermark's study found that adolescent girls displayed the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29566064/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;strongest association&lt;/a&gt; between hormonal contraceptives and antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication use. Those aged 12 to 14 were 240% and 190% more likely to be prescribed the drugs within a year of starting the combined pill and mini-pill, respectively; or 52% and 83% if they were between 15 and 17 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;In another study, based on the data from 264,557 women invovled with the UK Biobank, researchers found that those who had taken oral contraceptives at some point in their lives had a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-psychiatric-sciences/article/populationbased-cohort-study-of-oral-contraceptive-use-and-risk-of-depression/B3C611DD318D7DC536B4BD439343A5BD" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;higher risk of developing depression&lt;/a&gt; over their lifetime, but the risk was most pronounced during the first two years of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Apart from adolescents, there's another group many physicians are wary of prescribing oral contraception to. "If you have been depressed previously, have recurrent depressions, or any psychiatric issues at all, you have an increased risk of feeling depressed on the pill," cautions Kopp Kallner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;Experts such as Kopp Kallner say self-awareness is key – you should monitor your mood for a few months when you first start the pill, or switch from one brand to another. If you have concerns about how your contraception is affecting your mood, arrange to speak to your healthcare provider. With so &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/different-progestin-types-906936" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB"&gt;many different types of progestins&lt;/a&gt;, and combinations of these with artificial oestrogen, not to mention the different doses and preparations, finding the right fit is "a little bit of an art," says Bitzer. "It's very much individualised treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;However, there are many other types of contraception available that either do not involve hormones or contain lower doses than oral contraceptives, including male and female condoms (which can also help protect against sexually transmitted diseases), the vaginal ring, the IUS (the hormonal coil), the IUD (the copper coil), and sterilisation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe"&gt;For Hill, changing the method of contraception she used was life-altering.

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-08-2024-who-director-general-declares-mpox-outbreak-a-public-health-emergency-of-international-concern" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; mpox a public health emergency of international concern last August as cases rose in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and spread to neighboring countries in Africa. USAid has been working to contain the virus through vaccination, testing and surveillance efforts on the ground. Last year, USAid and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s0822-mpox-outbreak.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;contributed&lt;/a&gt; $55m in emergency assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usaid" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;USAid&lt;/a&gt; workers with knowledge of the agency’s mpox response said that not all of that money has been disbursed and is now frozen under the administration’s orders to stop nearly all humanitarian aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In addition to the funding freeze, USAid workers were evacuated from the country at the end of January, according to court filings. Until weeks ago, the United States was a leader in coordinating response efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One USAid worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said in planning meetings: “Immediately it’s eyes on USAid of, ‘What are you guys going to do?’ And so everybody’s lost right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The aid freeze has meant that some provinces in the country who depend solely on USAid funds have been stripped of any resources to contain the virus, the worker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We were working on creating a sustainable system that can respond not just to the current mpox outbreak but can be used in the future for any other outbreak and now we’re not sure if that will succeed,” said a second USAid worker with knowledge of the mpox response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Just like all these increased cases of Ebola and Marburg in neighboring countries, it’s not if, but when the next one in the DRC will be and how the country is going to be ready.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Cutting off resources to contain the current outbreak only increases the chances of mpox spreading to more countries, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Disaster and catastrophe are the appropriate words for shutting down USAid. It’s not just about people overseas who will be affected but there’s a likelihood of mpox or the next pandemic spreading to the United States,” said a US-based researcher who studies infectious diseases and asked for anonymity because of ongoing projects with the National Institutes of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A global outbreak of mpox in 2022 led to more than 100,000 cases in 122 countries and marked the first time that the disease had spread outside of central or western &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;. That outbreak has largely been contained and the number of cases is low, in part due to widespread vaccination efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The more recent outbreak in DRC is a distinct variant from the mpox virus that caused the 2022 outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio issued guidance that life-saving humanitarian assistance – including for food and medicine – may still be dispersed through a waiver despite the funding freeze. USAid workers said that while they have been seeking a waiver to continue mpox programming in the DRC, one had not been approved yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt; officials have said their aim is to reduce wasteful spending and fraud, public health researchers criticized the speed and ferocity of the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“If you’re gonna do these types of cuts, they have to be mindful,” said Amesh Adalja, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg school of public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“There’s this unpredictability that you can’t have if you’re trying to run a disease control program.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-17" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When that’s pulled, Adalja explained, “making decisions about vaccine allocation, vaccine programs, testing strategies, is missing expert input, and that makes it harder for it makes it harder for control efforts”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While much of the agency’s programming remains halted, the future of USAid continues to be challenged in court cases. One federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-funding" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; last Thursday that the aid freeze must be temporarily halted and gave the government five days to comply. Aid workers said the ruling has created confusion on how to restart programs that may be simply axed again shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Though USAid employees said in interviews they are most concerned about finding ways to continue the agency’s aid work, the last several weeks have been personally taxing as well, according to court testimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Three USAid workers described the chaos of being pulled from the Democratic Republic of Congo on 28 January as part of a federal lawsuit filed by unions representing federal workers. After protests broke out in Kinshasa, the embassy issued an order to evacuate. But with foreign aid frozen, Washington offices closed and many colleagues placed on administrative leave, USAid employees had little communication and were forced to fund their own evacuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4b49a43b-e311-4085-b6bb-eae1ad50db9f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":22,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Trump disrupting US bird flu response as outbreak worsens","elementId":"4b49a43b-e311-4085-b6bb-eae1ad50db9f","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/trump-bird-flu-response"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Workers described being shuttled into boats with their families with just enough space to hold a carry-on bag each on their laps or a backpack – many leaving pets and most of their belongings behind.

The United States was the biggest donor of the WHO and also benefited from sharing research with other countries it will no longer be privy to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“If we blindfold ourselves and tie our hands, we’re not going to make ourselves safer,” said Morse. “We will just be less aware of what’s killing us or what’s making us sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 10:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE51bjBlSktDTVo2OVUtTjVmekpoaXdCa1BvLTF1emxnMU5GcjhQSWhnYUJyQjhlQUhrYjJfamQzVlNoalpKUFNPc2lzanYzYS1KUlhyZlR6azFoMUFYa0E3RFp0aF81akZMOUVISHlvajhOdw</guid></item><item><title>Triton Alumni Shine on 2025 Forbes 30 Under 30 List - University of California San Diego</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQbkRRTmJ6ZWFlTnNlbDJMVjNncFR6LVBaNDlpRkdQUUI0MFdueWhpbjlzZzNaUzBYYXhhQXlyVzRvcVlzX3ROSXo0eUtKUktfVmtRY1Q1MkQ4TVdtWFlBLXBfRlRLYnIyb0Eya0tYUVFFMFpVanJNWVRzXzNTVW0yZ1Q0eE1ia0k?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="col col-left order-2 order-lg-1"&gt;
										&lt;p&gt;Today, Izhikevich leads the &lt;a href="https://ucla-scan.github.io/"&gt;Security and Networking (ScaN) Lab&lt;/a&gt; at UCLA, where she and her students apply data-driven methods to study internet security and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I love interacting with students,” she said. “I rely on them for thinking about the world in creative ways and proposing creative solutions. I think it’s key to have all these young minds who see the world slightly differently, to be able to essentially pitch in and propose ideas—that’s how we push science forward.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the UC system last July felt like coming “home” for Izhikevich. “On these UC campuses, you just feel it in everyone’s bones. Everyone’s there with a purpose. The students are very driven and motivated. I love the UC crowd,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her time at UC San Diego instilled in her not just technical expertise but a sense of balance—an ethos she says is embodied by &lt;a href="https://warren.ucsd.edu/"&gt;Earl Warren College&lt;/a&gt;’s motto, “Toward a life in balance.” “The computer science department really instills that as well,” Izhikevich said, adding that it’s something that she hopes to inculcate in the students working in her lab at UCLA. A daily yoga practice, which she started during her undergraduate years, remains an integral part of her routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond academic circles, Izhikevich sees her Forbes recognition as validation of her work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It shows that there is real impact being made,” she said. Whether optimizing satellite networks or guiding the next generation of computer scientists, Izhikevich is helping shape the future of internet security—one connection at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

For some, it’s never wanting to experience another hangover. For others, it’s a necessary sacrifice for their overall well-being. Whatever the reason, young Americans, ages 18–34, are focused on improving their health, according to a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648413/alcohol-consumption-increasingly-viewed-unhealthy.aspx#:~:text=Bar%20chart%20showing%20percentages%20of,is%20the%20lowest%20since%201996" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://news.gallup.com/poll/648413/alcohol-consumption-increasingly-viewed-unhealthy.aspx#:~:text=Bar%20chart%20showing%20percentages%20of,is%20the%20lowest%20since%201996"}' href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648413/alcohol-consumption-increasingly-viewed-unhealthy.aspx#:~:text=Bar%20chart%20showing%20percentages%20of,is%20the%20lowest%20since%201996" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2024 Gallup poll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This coincides with a January 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/oash-alcohol-cancer-risk.pdf"&gt;advisory from the surgeon general, Vivek Murthy&lt;/a&gt;, warning of a “casual link” between increased risk of seven types of cancer (including breast [in women], colorectal, esophagus, voice box, liver, mouth, and throat) and drinking, highlighting alcohol use as a “leading preventable cause of cancer…contributing to nearly 100,000 cancer cases and about 20,000 cancer deaths each year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This report is just the latest in decades of warnings that alcohol is harmful to people’s health. But that may not the sole—or even primary—cause of &lt;a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/nonalcoholic-bottle-shops-sober-curious-drinking" target="_blank"&gt;the substance’s downshift in popularity&lt;/a&gt;. Gallup reports that of the recent studies published concerning alcohol use and long-term health effects, “just 19% of US adults say they have heard ‘a great deal’ about such studies.” Thirty percent responded having heard “a fair amount,” while another 30% say they have “not heard much” and 21%, “nothing at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-hnJNtl gxMaIG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bon Appétit spoke to people across the country to hear their thoughts. For many, their choice to imbibe, abstain, drink less, or enjoy booze-free alternatives is deeply personal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ContentCardEmbedWrapper-kULtsE iGAJsG content-card-embed content-card-embed--stacked" data-testid="ContentCardEmbedWrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="ContentCardEmbedInfo-bDftKl bGnSrq"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="ContentCardEmbedDek" class="ContentCardEmbedDek-bA-DKch iuyVgm"&gt;While big box giants jump on the NA boom, mom-and-pop shops prioritize community with a personal touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natalie Pedraza, 24 (Monroe, LA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never drank before I went to college, and I was a bigger drinker then than I am now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was like every other night, but since graduating, that’s died down a lot. Since moving to Northeast Louisiana, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; there is to do here is drink. It’s a small, Southern town—that’s what people do. I go to Wine Wednesdays, which wasn’t something I did when I first moved here, but it’s part of the culture. We’ll go out once, maybe twice a week drinking. A new restaurant, Apero, opened recently with a zero-proof gin and a mocktail list, but it’s not a regular thing here. If you’re not drinking alcohol here, you’re drinking Coke or Dr Pepper or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wealth disparity in Monroe is very large. For a lot of people, they’d rather spend $5 for a beer than $11 or $13 for something maybe better for you. It would be harder to find nonalcoholic alternatives here, to keep up with a [sober curious] lifestyle. I would have to go out of my way to do it. For me personally, the alternative is CBD or THC, but here there’s still a lot of stigma in the South around those. Alcohol is more socially acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do feel like everything nowadays causes cancer. [The surgeon general’s announcement] does make me rethink a lot of things. I’m thinking back to college and wondering how much I increased my risk, that does make me worried a little bit. But I also feel like, on social media for me, there are a lot of people that are health conscious on TikTok that make this information make sense a little bit more—especially with women. We’re targeted a little bit more.

This was the early ’00s, so no one batted an eye when I said I was on a diet. The body positivity movement hadn’t fully integrated with general society and we were expected to hate our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I drew grids on printer paper and wrote out what I ate each day. One box for breakfast (nothing), one box for lunch (a rice cake), one box for dinner (carrot sticks). I was more concerned with not eating than I was with being skinny. Hunger was a proxy, a way to redirect bad feelings I didn’t know how to cope with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything could send me into a crash diet—lunchroom tension that put my already low social standing at risk. The classroom bully making fun of my socks. A tearful argument with my mom. My bouts of restriction were always preceded by a jittery, head-spinning buzz. I would later learn that this was a physical manifestation of anxiety, but all I knew at the time was that focusing on hunger helped alleviate my shaky nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each episode lasted a few days, a week at most. The bad feeling would fade, I’d become tired of feeling hungry, or my friends would start talking to me again. I never confronted my anxiety or developed skills to deal with my feelings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in the winter of my sophomore year of college, I found out my boyfriend was cheating on me. If you’ve ever been a sophomore in college with a boyfriend who cheated on you, you are aware that this is the worst thing in the entire world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dove headfirst into a full-blown eating disorder. Do not pass go, do not collect $200. Instead of confronting the ravaged ache of my teenage heart, I turned to what had always been there: restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While eating disorders can (and do) develop on the basis of body image, they are often adaptive, which means the person engages in those behaviors for reasons other than weight loss. Focusing on pain within my control—hunger via restriction—was my panicked attempt at reclaiming power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I picture myself at 19, walking out of the daylight down a wooded pathway that rapidly closes in, becoming narrower and more twisted until I am so tangled in branches I can’t move forward or turn back. If I’d known that 17 years into the future, at the age of 36, I would be sitting hunched over to hide my stomach, cringing at mirrors, and sobbing at the sight of my body in a dress, maybe I would have done something differently. Maybe I would have dedicated more energy to therapy, found healthy ways to process, accepted that sometimes life feels hard and then you get over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I was 19 and did not know the future. I did not know patience. I had no way to understand that the shock of heartbreak is like riding a tidal wave that eventually loses momentum, settling back to the swells of daily life. At 19 I couldn’t imagine I’d ever be on the other side, so I did nothing except starve myself. And for the first time, I lost weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, my refusal to eat flew under the radar. Restriction is aligned with diet culture, making it a fairly acceptable form of behavioral control, at least to a certain extent. Plus, you get a lot of positive reinforcement when you lose weight. So when I started seeing physical results, something flipped in my brain and an already unhealthy coping mechanism turned into something more insidious, like a nest of snakes cracking through shells, flicking their forked tongues in the air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I was 19 and did not know the future. I did not know patience. I had no way to understand that the shock of heartbreak is like riding a tidal wave that eventually loses momentum, settling back to the swells of daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soft padding of flesh around my hips shrank, then vanished. My D-cup chest shriveled to a C, then a B. I stood in front of the mirror one morning, dizzy with hunger and awe, tracing a finger around my protruding collarbone. I raised my arms over my head and saw the shadowed curves of one, two, three ribs. If I stood at just the right angle, I could glimpse air between my thighs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before this, restricting had been about being hungry. But with this rapid weight loss, the snakes uncoiled in my brain, coming to life in the success of measurable metrics. I went from never weighing myself to stepping on the scale a dozen times a day. The hunger cramps and lightheadedness were worth it, as long as the number continued to drop. It wasn’t easy though—I craved food from the moment I woke up to the moment I curled around my gnawing, empty stomach and tried to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common misconception about eating disorders is that the person doesn’t want to eat. That isn’t always true, and certainly not for me. I thought about food all the time. I stared at girls eating—not in disgust but in envy. Sharing pastries outside coffee shops, tearing open energy bar wrappers in the gym lobby. I walked through the dining hall with my tray of food substitutes—fat-free Cool Whip, iceberg lettuce doused in ketchup—trying not to gape as I passed a dining hall employee shaking salt over a tray of french fries and sliding a pan of cheeseburgers under the heat lamp. But eating meant failure, and the earth-shaking loss of my relationship was already enough failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I developed strategies for keeping the hunger at bay, gnawing on bowls of air-popped popcorn and dry Fiber One cereal, mentally subtracting the fiber from the overall calories. I drank decaf instant coffee from morning until night, dumped packets of Splenda over bowls of slimy sugar-free JELL-O, did anything I could to create the illusion of flavor and food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adhering to my own rules for what (and when) I could eat became increasingly stressful. Whispers spread through my social group about my weight loss and bizarre habits, and I started going to the dining hall alone, sitting at a two-top against the wall so no one could see my disordered facsimile of a meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My brain, which had always felt sharp, became confused and groggy. I felt trapped between sleep and wakefulness, unable to focus in class. I heard my sentences trail off through an echoing tunnel. I scanned my body obsessively every chance I got. I peered into the mirror to make sure I could still see the correct collarbone depth and angular bones jutting from behind my shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But eating meant failure, and the earth-shaking loss of my relationship was already enough failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my weight loss slowed—the body’s desperate bid to cling to calories—I doubled down on the rules that governed my life. No solid food until 12 p.m. After noon I could chew a piece of gum, and if I was about to pass out, I was allowed a bite of fat-free cottage cheese. In the evenings, I ate one green apple cut into 32 slices. I drank Diet Coke and instant coffee to fool my stomach into thinking it was full. I set impossible-to-reach standards of success that would finally let me be happy: a perfect day of restriction, a new and lower number on the scale. But the goal post kept moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late spring, all my waking hours revolved around not eating. I trailed behind my friends one evening, starving and exhausted as I pulled myself up the railing toward the student union building. It was late in the day and I had been “good,” following the rules without slipping up. This meant I’d had just half a cucumber, my allotted apple, and so much instant coffee my teeth were covered in fine silt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not waiting three hours for her to cross campus,” one of the girls snapped, tossing her flat-ironed hair over the collar of her North Face fleece. I paused and shoved a piece of gum in my mouth, trying to ease the sting of her words. The truth was, while being skinny was the most important part of my life, I was getting a little sick of feeling dull and starving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t eaten bread or butter or cookies or pasta or salad dressing in six months. I missed being able to walk up a flight of stairs. The thick wool around my brain was both maddening and alarming. &lt;em&gt;OK, &lt;/em&gt;I thought, watching my friends disappear into the building as I slowly ascended the steps. &lt;em&gt;Maybe it’s time to start eating again. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning I carefully folded a slice of wheat bread around a dab of peanut butter: a sad, eating-disordered version of a sandwich. I saved it for that afternoon, feeling the weight of it in my pocket as I crossed campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I pulled the sandwich out of my pocket when I arrived for my shift at the gym. But then I froze, unable to pick it up.&lt;em&gt; If I eat this sandwich, what next? Bagels? Pizza? Cake? Ice cream? All of this discipline and success for nothing? Who will I be if I’m not skinny?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panic flooded my chest. I pinched off a piece of bread and rolled it between my fingers until it became a spongy marble. The desk phone rang shrilly, echoing the ringing in my ears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ignored the phone and stared at the sandwich. I tore it in half, then in half again. I shredded those four pieces until the sandwich lay scattered on the desk in 12 mutilated chunks. The phone rang again and I ignored it, my heart racing as I stared at the crumbled bread and peanut butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My coworker hurried out of the back room balancing a pile of folders. He glared at me as he grabbed the phone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I swept the sandwich into the garbage without taking a bite. My head swam from hunger, but something else, too: the dark seed of fear that I’d gone too far, the snakes embedded in every crevice of my brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating this sandwich should be my choice, right? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No? OK then, what now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I somehow passed my finals and went home for the summer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My parents were horrified when they saw me, a skeletal shadow of the daughter they’d dropped off after Christmas break. My mother immediately booked a slew of appointments with a nutritionist, a primary care physician, and a therapist. I was over 18, but my parents paid my college tuition and the appointments were nonnegotiable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I slumped mutely in the backseat of the minivan, ignoring her as we rode elevators up and down columns of identical office buildings, feeling nothing except a dull flash of pride the first time I heard the word &lt;em&gt;anorexia &lt;/em&gt;in hushed tones. At least I’d succeeded at something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My summer at home was a nightmare for everyone. My family begged me to have dinner with them, my mom pinched and pleading and my younger siblings staring silently at their plates. My dad was more understanding. He had quietly fought his own battles with body image and restriction throughout my childhood, but he was still helpless seeing how far I’d plunged down the rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have the words to say how I wanted to join them, or explain why I couldn’t. I would have loved to go to the ice cream stand or yell out topping suggestions when we called for pizza. I wanted to pile my dad’s famous meatballs on a heaping mound of pasta and elbow my sister for the green shaker of powdered parmesan. But I hovered in the doorway like a ghoul of an eldest daughter, desperate to be near food and warmth but too scared to take a bite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not hungry,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night in August, I did join them for ice cream. We’d driven to an event together and I was too woozy to walk back to the house alone. Or maybe that’s not true. Maybe I didn’t need a ride back, but I was tired of arguing about food. Maybe I wanted to pretend I was normal. Maybe I just wanted to eat some fucking ice cream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it was my turn to order, the bored high schooler in a pastel baseball cap hovered her pen over the ticket. I opened my mouth to order the tasteless, sugar-free frozen yogurt from the back of the case, covered in ice crystals from neglect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Can I have a large sundae, with mint chip, rocky road, sprinkles, and extra hot fudge?” I asked, my voice high-pitched and unfamiliar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later my order appeared in the window. A sloppy, overflowing bowl of ice cream with hot fudge dripping down the side and a maraschino cherry leaking electric red dye down the sagging pile of whipped cream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I inhaled the sundae in a frantic, bug-eyed rush. My siblings pretended not to stare, but I could feel the tension drain as I ate. &lt;em&gt;She’s eating ice cream. Maybe she’s going to get better; maybe this is over. &lt;/em&gt;They chattered over each other as they dug into their cones, the rise and fall of  conversation a backdrop to the dopamine receptors firing so hard I could barely see straight. The taste of real food made me swoon: thick, creamy ice cream, crunchy sprinkles, gooey fudge hardened into sticky clumps. I scraped the bottom of the dish so hard I bent the plastic spoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colors of the outdoor patio felt saturated, like my vision was turned up to superhero level. My voice sounded like it was coming through a tunnel as I said: &lt;em&gt;be right back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The little dairy hut had a one-stall private bathroom. And ice cream, as it turned out, was one of the easiest things to get back up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wherever I’d been before—the on-and-off restriction, the full-blown anorexia, somewhere in between—bulimia was so much worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a certain purity in restriction, an ethereal perfection in refusing food. You are elevated, you don’t &lt;em&gt;need &lt;/em&gt;like others do. In the hierarchy of eating disorders, anorexia is at the top. To be diagnosed with anorexia is a symbol of willpower and control. Bulimia is the opposite. It means giving in to hedonistic, animal cravings. You are always doing something wrong (eating), then atoning for it (purging). It is a descent straight to hell and I was powerless to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I ate the ice cream, there was no going back. Every morning I woke up and prepared to battle my mind and body, begging the two to cooperate and not wind up in an out-of-control nighttime binge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d make it through most of the day, then fall apart at night. Soon there were multiple fugue-like binges each day. My electrolytes became so skewed I’d see stars when I stood up, and I built a mental map of single-stall campus bathrooms where I could jam my fingers down my throat until blood vessels burst in my eyes and the corners of my lips split apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be diagnosed with anorexia is a symbol of willpower and control. Bulimia is the opposite. It means giving in to hedonistic, animal cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lost whatever remained of my brain power. My head was so fuzzy I’d set the shampoo outside of the shower door after I’d used it, then put the conditioner out afterwards. Otherwise I’d have no memory of what stage of hair washing I was at, repeating the lather and rinse so many times I’d start crying from confusion and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My world was reduced to fear, hunger, and shame. There was no self anymore. &lt;em&gt;I feel like everything is gray and I miss color&lt;/em&gt;, I scrawled in a barely legible journal entry, one of only a few coherent thoughts in a notebook filled with run-on sentences panicking about food and weight and sadness and self-loathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand (or even perhaps empathize with) the eating-disordered mind requires some suspension of disbelief. You have to accept that after a certain point, very little of it makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt like a rat trapped in a maze with no finish, running into walls and getting electrocuted at every turn. I wanted out of the hellscape I’d created, but I had formed a whole identity around the latticework of visible bones and tendons; my days were structured around the denial of food. To give up the eating disorder meant losing the core of who I had become. If I lost control over the core of my being, it would mean I failed. If I failed . . . I didn’t have an answer for what happened after failure. It was too terrifying to think about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family lived within driving distance, and one night my mom dropped me back on campus after my sister’s birthday dinner. I’d swayed in a chair all night, shifting from side to side on my bony butt, spots dancing in front of my eyes as I tried to resist binging on ice cream cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mom was quiet on the drive, but as we pulled up to my apartment building, she pushed a trifold pamphlet into my chapped hands. I tilted it toward the window, squinting at &lt;em&gt;Walden Center for Behavioral Health&lt;/em&gt; printed in black over a watercolor of two people walking a flower-lined path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What is this?” I asked, pinching it between two fingers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a residential program,” she said. “A special program for eating disorders.” She flinched almost imperceptibly as the words hovered between us. I was prone to eruptions at any mention of doctors, therapy, or eating, so I can’t imagine the guts it took for her to hand me this pamphlet, how she must have felt on the drive to campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You &lt;em&gt;talked &lt;/em&gt;to them?” I hissed, flinging the seatbelt so hard over my shoulder it hit the door. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maggie,” she said, her voice shaking but measured. “You need help. We are terrified. Do it for your siblings, dad, myself. School, riding horses, running. Please, we miss you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m. Fine.” I could hear the low pitch of my voice building into simmering rage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She held her ground. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lunged out of the car, slamming the door as she sat with her hands curled around the steering wheel, staring at her lap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, I pulled the pamphlet out of my desk drawer and called the number. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember the exact moment I called, or what made me do it. I told people that I’d fainted in the shower and hit my head hard enough to be scared for my life. I didn’t want to lie, but I felt the need to justify giving up the eating disorder. It wasn’t enough to just want my life back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I did want my life back. Desperately. I felt like being dead would be better than continuing to exist. I weighed less than 100 pounds. It hurt to sit and to stand, my knuckles bled from scraping them against my teeth, and I nearly fainted every time I stood up. My friends couldn’t stand me, my family was scared of me, I couldn’t put together a full sentence, and I missed who I used to be as a person. That was it. Those were my reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I checked into Walden the day after Christmas of my junior year. I’d wound up following a not-uncommon trajectory: More than &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3684068/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;50 percent of women&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed with bulimia have a history of anorexia. The rigid restriction I’d put myself through was unsustainable in the long term, and like other patients, had led to binge eating and compensatory purging. By the time I dragged my floral duffel through the sliding doors of Walden, I fit the criteria for “restrictive bulimia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walden Center had four units on the ground floor of a beautiful apartment building in eastern Massachusetts. Residents moved apartments as they progressed through the program, rewarded with less supervision and more privileges at each stage. I started in the first apartment, with open-door bathroom monitoring, no outside walks beside a brief daily dose of fresh air, and one slow, supervised yoga session every week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walden’s program was fairly standard for a residential facility. Along with weight restoration and interrupting eating disorder behaviors, treatment emphasized relearning how to have a normal relationship with food. With supervision, we made shopping lists and cooked our own meals. It was a far cry from the trays of hospital food I’d imagined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each resident had their own daily requirements, which included portions of grains, proteins, fats, fruits, and vegetables. There were no mentions of calories, just a list of foods under each category. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of grains alone contained a cornucopia of illegal food: oatmeal, bagels, english muffins, bread, cereal, granola bars. Proteins were even more thrilling: Greek yogurt, string cheese, cream cheese, bacon, hamburgers, beans. Foods I hadn’t eaten outside of hollow-eyed, guilt-ridden binges in more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I settled in quickly, determined to learn the rules and do everything well. Each week we huddled around Stop &amp;amp; Shop delivery forms, consulting each other as a counselor sat at the table with one ear tuned to the conversation. We had to create a weekly grocery list that would stock the pantry for our meals. It was a simple task that stretched our brains to their limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stared at the list of food, moving a stubby pencil between rice, honey, half and half, chicken. &lt;em&gt;What does a normal meal look like? &lt;/em&gt;It doesn’t look like stewed tomatoes eaten from the can, but it also doesn’t look like a pint of Ben and Jerry’s, a bag of Goldfish, four bowls of Frosted Flakes, and half a jar of hot fudge followed by 30 minutes in the bathroom turning my stomach inside out before collapsing with a tear-streaked cheek pressed to the tile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three times per day, each apartment’s residents gathered in the kitchens to make meals that fulfilled our requirements. Emotions ran high and the counselors were present to both calm us and approve our choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I need three grains, two proteins, a vegetable, and two fats for dinner, this could mean a baked potato, a hamburger on a bun, a side of baked beans, and two servings of butter on the potato. Once I explained the meal to the counselor and showed them each measured component as I added it to my plate, they’d jot their initials next to my name and I could take a seat at the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dutifully fulfilled my meal requirements. I held my arm out for blood pressure and vitals checks each morning and night and was weighed on a blind scale every other day. I participated in nutrition classes, suffered through weekly family therapy, and shoved my clothes into my bag every 10 days as I moved to the next apartment. The second apartment had closed-door bathroom privileges, the third had a longer outdoor walk each day. It was progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d all voluntarily checked in, but we clung to shreds of control where we could. One of my roommates did push-ups in the bathroom. We lifted food packages surreptitiously to the light, trying to find an angle that allowed us to see the Sharpied-over nutrition facts. I circled the fountain on supervised walks, chatting with another girl who had also been a runner. A counselor always called us back, clocking the attempt at exercising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still hesitated at the table, under-measured the butter for my mashed potatoes, filled the measuring cup with water and a splash of milk for opacity before turning to the counselor to check off my protein category. I still nodded slightly when one of the girls, wearing compression socks for edema, gave a tiny head shake as I reached for the refried beans for my protein one night. I drifted my hand toward the black beans: lower calories and fat. She nodded just perceptibly before going back to preparing her own meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a tiring push-pull, releasing the hold of a psychiatric disorder. But other than the occasional miserable family therapy session or rapidly corrected eating disorder behaviors, the program was calm and quiet. None of us had much energy, and the emotional toll of weight gain kept us low-key. The days blended together, the passage of time marked by each meal or completing another 1,000-piece puzzle. The misery of restriction, the monstrous feeling of a binge, the desperation of a purge—they were all replaced by new emotions. There was the minor frustration of a tangled, lumpy knitting project, the glee at placing the final jigsaw puzzle piece, the spark of pride during a joyful moment in group therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-light-gray-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-2 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left Walden after four weeks, having regained enough weight to medically stabilize. I had a plan for outpatient counseling and dietitian checkups, and my own set of measuring cups so I could continue my restoration plan at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I drove myself to my nutrition appointments between classes and horseback riding at the university stable, and I started running again, relishing the clear-headed energy and swell of muscle in my quads. I slipped up here and there, but within two years of leaving Walden, I was declared recovered. There were no rampant eating-disordered behaviors and the number on the scale stayed within a reasonable range. The coil of snakes lay dormant, and as far as I and my medical team were concerned, we’d eradicated them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was good for a time. I moved out west after graduating, and I devoted my next decade to a newfound love of the outdoors. My social life revolved around activity: I was a strong climber, a capable mountain biker, and I backpacked at a punishing pace, covering hundreds of miles of mountainous terrain alone and unafraid. None of these elements would have been possible without a strong body, and because I was so fit, I effortlessly maintained that lean strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no fear of food or body shame during those years. But the shadow was still somewhere in my brain, the coiled snakes stilled by my multi-sport fitness and high mileage in the mountains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I see my eating disorder still showed up in sneaky ways. I joked about how I didn’t enjoy cooking, fielded comments about the speed at which I ate, and attributed the fact that I cleaned the kitchen completely before eating to being tidy. In reality, I still associated food with guilt. I ate fast to get it over with and remove any evidence I had made food. Additionally, my high level of activity meant I was constantly trading calories back and forth in my mind, a background abacus with the beads click-clacking back and forth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I thought my eating disorder would stay quiet forever, I was wrong. A few years ago, the combination of a naturally slowing metabolism and pandemic-induced lifestyle change altered my body. My pants stopped buttoning smoothly, my outline softened. I couldn’t tell you exactly what was different, but I knew something had changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first I was confused. I opened a slew of tabs on my phone, scrolling through piles of unhelpful SEO clickbait. Was seltzer making me bloated? Was I biking too much and not running enough? The dormant shadow, the coil of snakes in my brain woke up, stretched, shook themselves out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started obsessing over my body in a way I hadn’t since college. I avoided mirrors, kept the lights off in the bathroom, and wrapped a towel around my body before stepping out of the shower. I went from wearing dresses, skirts, crop tops, and matching workout sets to baggy shirts and high-rise leggings with wide elastic waistbands. I stood slightly bent over and pushed my hands into my pockets to hold my clothes out from my body, walking down the street like a polyester circus tent. It didn’t help that the body positivity trends of the past several years seemed to have vanished in the blink of an algorithm, and suddenly I was being spoon-fed a steady stream of thin-is-in videos that sent me reeling back to the magazine covers of my college years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Body dysmorphia flared as fast and hot as my eating disorder had 15 years before. The all-consuming thoughts stretched back to my 19-year-old self, sobbing on the floor, vowing never to eat again after being cheated on. Now, here I was in my mid-30s, my brain short-circuiting on a trip to Europe because there were too many store-window reflections, I’d packed the wrong clothes, and the restaurants made me feel full. I spent an hour-long bus ride deleting every photo of myself where my arms were visible, my thighs were touching, and the outline of my stomach showed through my shirt. I pulled away from my boyfriend and stared at the floor in the claustrophobic elevators, the mirrored walls a reflective torment. Everywhere I looked, there I was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I broke down in my therapist’s office when I returned, gesturing at my body as I grasped for a pillow to hold over my stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Look at me,” I sobbed, “what’s happening to my body?” My brain writhed, hot, like a rock had been pushed aside to release the pit of vipers. My therapist was quiet for a moment, letting my words echo in the small office. She passed me a box of tissues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think what we’re looking at is body dysmorphia,” she said. I hiccuped and shook my head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No,” I said, “I know what I look like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I didn’t know what I looked like, I still don’t. Present tense. The unfortunate truth of eating disorders is that no matter how “recovered” you feel, act, and look, there are some elements that might never go away. Body dysmorphia is the last thing to go, if it ever does. To be trapped in this mind is like revisiting the most potent mental and emotional elements of the eating disorder without the physical symptoms and behaviors. And it’s all inward facing—I do not judge bodies of different shapes and sizes. This cruelty is solely reserved for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internet sands down the edges of body dysmorphic disorder. Except for the most severe cases (in which people might undergo cosmetic surgery), search results tell you that someone with body dysmorphia might avoid mirrors, or perhaps compare how they look to other people. It sounds like someone having a bad hair day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These surface-level explainers don’t reveal what it’s like to &lt;em&gt;exist&lt;/em&gt; in that brain. To be unable to concentrate because of your waistband rolled down, to have your day ruined by the wrong angle in the wrong mirror, to leave your partner alone on the couch because oops, you remembered that you have a body and that they might touch it. As long as you are awake, you are aware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand how stunningly stupid it is to spend this much time thinking about the softness of my stomach or the width of my arms. Throw a dart anywhere on a map and you’ll find someone having a worse day, week, month, or life than me. But I cannot convince my disordered brain this battle is not worth fighting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as you are awake, you are aware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They weighed me at the doctor’s office in 2008 and declared me recovered, but in reality, eating disorder researchers cannot agree on how to define true recovery. It’s easy to measure “healthy” weight with simple metrics to determine medical stability. It’s somewhat harder—but still relatively straightforward—to determine whether the person is engaging in eating disorder behaviors. Severe restriction? Binging and purging? Creating “meals” with foods that should not be combined? That’s all pretty obvious. But what about panic at the sight of mirrors, distress at the cling of clothing? Eating so fast you almost choke because you need to get it over with? Spiraling because your sleeves felt tight? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based psychotherapist Erika Bent is a certified eating disorder specialist supervisor. She studied anorexia as a researcher before transitioning to clinical and residential work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The psychology that you’re describing is harder to measure,” Bent tells me as I describe limiting my access to mirrors and leaving the lights off lest I catch a glimpse of my reflection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Body image distress is one of the last things to be resolved in eating disorder recovery,” she says, adding that this is such a standard experience for people with a history of eating disorders that it even has a name: “normative discontent.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel better in that I’m not alone. I feel worse in that this might be how my brain works forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One fall morning, I scan the address numbers above a sidewalk I’ve walked every week for years, following the blue dot on my phone screen to a door I’ve never noticed. The Eating Disorder Center of Montana has two locations, and this one is right off the main road on a busy side street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find myself anxiously rehearsing my introduction as I climb the stairs, even though I’ve already told Lauren Stille, the lead dietitian, that I’m here as a journalist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of literature but not a lot of consensus about long-term recovery, and I have many questions. I’m so trapped in my head I’m secretly hoping she’s going to give me some good news: Body dysmorphia has a timeline, that I will soon wear the dozens of outfits in my closet and not the same (safe) pair of baggy sweatpants-and-sweatshirt combo. That I can move on after eating a large meal and not dissolve into hysterics because I feel full. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dysmorphia is a terrible, crippling thing,” Stille says. She is relaxed in a leather chair while I’m hunched on the couch across from her, leaning forward to hide my stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reiterate throughout the conversation that I’m only here for this essay, but she’s a therapist and an expert in the field of eating disorders. She knows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing [body dysmorphia] become more and more common,” she continues, telling me that it can escalate by how often the media draws attention to our bodies, insisting everything can be improved and modified. “You don’t like something about yourself? You can fix it and that’s the ticket to happiness.” I circle back to my eating-disordered thoughts from 15 years ago. &lt;em&gt;If I just have a perfect restriction day, if I just reach this new number on the scale. Then I’ll feel good. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She tells me what I already know: Recovery is complicated. And these days, they’re trying to emphasize that there is no straightforward way to say &lt;em&gt;I’m recovered. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s more that ‘my eating disorder is currently quieter,’” Stille says&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;“Your entire future is about continuing that work of recovery.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh god,” I say, tapping the recorder to check the time, but really to avoid eye contact. “That is grim.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s little data on the mental and emotional outcomes in long-term eating disorder recovery, especially past the 10-year mark. One &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883487/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;22-year study&lt;/a&gt; describes a shift in the therapeutic approach. Rather than treating for strict recovery guidelines, treatment should match a patient’s goals, which might not look like traditional recovery. This is a start, and helps encourage the idea that success doesn’t always operate on a binary. If anything, this could help minimize treatment and counseling dropouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the long-term studies that do exist &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/eat.20443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mostly follow patients&lt;/a&gt; with the resources to be in treatment, or to get diagnosed in the first place. Everything from clinical therapy to inpatient treatment is expensive and exclusive. To even begin untangling the process requires understanding complex medical systems and insurance providers. I had the privilege of my family’s health insurance, but people in less advantaged circumstances don’t have the same resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until my body dysmorphia spiked in the last two years, I rarely thought about my oddly fast eating habits or that I was subconsciously using exercise as a projection for feeling good about my body. It’s pretty crushing to learn that this might be the way my brain works for the rest of my life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does, however, make me feel marginally better to learn that some elements might not have been within my control. While the cultural fixation on thinness is an important and disturbingly prevalent factor in the development of eating disorders, only a minimal percentage of people are affected to the extent I was. Given that so many people are exposed to the same cultural messaging, why aren’t more people affected to the same degree?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics seem to play an increasingly large role, and research is starting to indicate that some people may have a latent vulnerability to eating disorders, similar to alcoholism. These tendencies might never be “turned on” without the right combination of environmental factors, but that genetic potential—plus a high instance of comorbidity with anxiety—created the perfect petri dish for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My brain should be full of wonder and gratitude for my life: joy at finally keeping my houseplants alive, excitement as I plan next season’s travels, pride after finishing another rugged backcountry trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, I plan trips around whether or not I’ll have to wear a bathing suit. I fling clothes onto the floor in a heap if they fit the wrong way. I crumple to the ground because my stomach touches my overalls in a way it didn’t last summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I traveled to the desert this fall to help connect shuttles and food caches during a five-day backcountry trip. My partner and I led the group through sandstone arches, slot canyons, and desert oases most people will never see. I carried 60 pounds of supplies on my back and hiked alone into the canyon to set the cache, quads and glutes and back and shoulders moving fast over miles of cracked mud flats under a punishing sun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was proud of my strong, capable, dust-caked body in the Southern Utah backcountry. I am tough on the trails where I’ve found my footing over the past decade. I’ve seen places on this planet I could have never imagined as I stared out the window of Walden Center that winter 15 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the pride is conditional, and I can’t predict when the switch will flip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in town I shed my reeking layers in a dingy Motel 6. The flickering bulb cast a sickly fluorescent light on my stomach, thighs, and arms. My body—which felt so powerful climbing out of the canyon just hours before—was reduced to a slab of pale, dimpled flesh, the &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; picture on a social media slideshow or 2006 diet-ad billboard. All I did was flick the light on, and my joy from the desert dissolved in the reality of being myself, chained to the dregs of a decades-long eating disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shame and disgust at my body turned to tears as the water ran gritty and brown down my filthy legs. I stare at the rust around the drain and think: &lt;em&gt;Someone, please, get me out of my head.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It feels painfully indulgent to have had an eating disorder, even more so to still be held captive by it. To have had all the privilege and food in the world, yet spend untold hours thinking about the imperfections of a body that has tried so hard to be good for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I think about the elements that make up a life, will any of my accomplishments include skipping dessert? Do I get an award for having a salad instead of a burger? I will never be remembered for the two years I had a thigh gap or that I dragged myself to the gym 100 days in a row. Saying no to food didn’t make my problems go away, it replaced them with other problems—when I came through the other side, the original problems were still there. If I’d known what this would have looked like in the future, would I have tried harder at 19 to avoid it? Would I even have been able to? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, more than 15 years after being declared recovered, I can tell you that sometimes there’s no tidy, closed loop with a psychiatric disorder. And that talking about it in the present tense can be the most realistic way to address it. For now, my hope is that someday I can return from the desert or the mountains, turn on the bathroom light, glance at my body in the mirror, and just say &lt;em&gt;thank you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.maggieslepian.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maggie Slepian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a full-time writer based in Montana.

&lt;p&gt;Called &lt;a href="https://asthmatool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Asthma Tool&lt;/a&gt;, the free software allows users to track their symptoms and triggers and to use wearable devices to monitor vitals, like resting heart rate, for signs that asthma may be acting up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Millions of people live with the chronic respiratory condition, in which people’s airways become blocked, and key management strategies include avoiding triggers and using medication to prevent worsening of symptoms that can land people in the hospital. Asthma Tool is intended to help users better understand their asthma so they can better manage it.&lt;/p&gt;

It is also produced within the body's cells when ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight hit the skin, triggering vitamin D synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what the source, though, vitamin D must be activated within the body—first through the liver, which converts vitamin D to calcidiol, and then in the kidney, which forms what's known as calcitriol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once activated, vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut, prevents muscle cramps and spasms, and leads to healthy bone growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D also plays a role in reducing inflammation, immune function, and glucose metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Does vitamin D give you energy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fair amount of research backs the idea that vitamin D may help put some pep in your step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5207540/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compared the results of two groups with fatigue and vitamin D deficiency—one of which was given vitamin D supplements, the other a placebo. In just four weeks, the group given vitamin D experienced significant improvements in energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a small &lt;a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/articles/archive/2013/04/vitamindproventoboostenergyfromwithinthecells.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study out of the U.K.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study out of the U.K.&lt;/a&gt; found vitamin D vital for making our muscles work efficiently and boosting energy levels. It showed that muscle function improves with vitamin D supplements, suggesting that fatigue could be due to "reduced efficiency of the mitochondria: the ‘power stations’ within each cell of the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4081585/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study of soccer players;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study of soccer players&lt;/a&gt; found a link between vitamin D and improved athletic performance; &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5457862/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:another found;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;another found&lt;/a&gt; vitamin D improved the energy levels of recent kidney transplant patients.

"Testing for vitamin deficiencies, such as vitamin D and &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/vitamin-b12-supplements-energy-boost/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin B12;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt;, especially in vegetarians, is crucial. Additionally, I would screen for thyroid disorders if other symptoms suggest such a condition, and I would also rule out anemia and &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/iron-deficiency-anemia-fatigue-brain-fog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:iron deficiency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;iron deficiency&lt;/a&gt;. It’s important to identify the underlying cause accurately to ensure appropriate and effective treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts caution that a supplement is unlikely to help if you're not deficient in a nutrient. Still, notes a &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/supplements-a-scorecard" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Harvard newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Harvard newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, “It’s very hard to get the vitamin D you need from your diet; oily fish and fortified dairy products are the only important sources." An analysis of 2013–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/usual/Usual_Intake_gender_WWEIA_2013_2016.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; showed that 92% of men and more than 97% of women ingested insufficient amounts of vitamin D daily from food and beverages. So supplements likely make sense for most adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once vitamin D supplements are determined to be appropriate, exercise caution when making your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Be wary of supplements that are far cheaper than the rest or look like a good deal,” &lt;a href="https://drbrighten.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jolene Brighten;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jolene Brighten&lt;/a&gt;, naturopathic endocrinologist and author of &lt;em&gt;Is This Normal?&lt;/em&gt;, previously &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/best-supplements-boost-energy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Fortune.&lt;/em&gt; “Often these are using poor quality ingredients, and in some cases … they won’t actually have what the label lists.” (The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates supplements, but doesn't approve them for safety or effectiveness before they are sold to the public.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers may want to consult the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health [Office of Dietary Supplements];elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health [Office of Dietary Supplements]&lt;/a&gt; as well as subscription-based sources, such as &lt;a href="https://www.consumerlab.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Consumer Lab;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Consumer Lab&lt;/a&gt;, which looks into issues ranging from possible contaminants to making sure a supplement contains what it claims to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much vitamin D do you need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recommended daily intake for adults up to age 70 is 600 IU and 800 IU for adults over 70, &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#h3" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the NIH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the NIH&lt;/a&gt;. Brighten adds, "It is also important to be getting enough sunlight.” She also underscores the importance of testing D levels to help determine what you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't overdo it on supplements, caution experts. Taking too much vitamin D can be toxic in rare cases, as with an 89-year-old U.K. man &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/vitamin-d-toxicity/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:who died last year;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;who died last year&lt;/a&gt; in part from vitamin D toxicity (though he did have several underlying conditions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, notes the Office of Dietary Supplements, vitamin D can interact poorly with some medications, including statins and steroids, so be sure to discuss with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally published on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://fortune.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fortune.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortune.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; on Oct. 5, 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on nutrition and supplements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story was originally featured on &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/does-vitamin-d-give-you-energy-supplements-d3-boost-levels-help/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fortune.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Fortune.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 09:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFAxSE91TkVyQnNLaWxMMm85bVktRXhzZEM5NHF5cjJsQlVadXNRMEowZ19UdUd0SEdhTHhQWjZ0TTBTUDlzWWgzM0N3V0lOSGxNWnpKX1lCcU96cEp0OUl4eG1oM1BRVVZ1Yzhpb3ZFNWs</guid></item><item><title>Video of Cat ‘Patiently Waiting’ for Date Melts Hearts - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPSlRDai1GQ2pVaVRKeHVpLTJHUjdERHhKdFM1UXVyT3U5MUI1TWsxV015S05ya25jVmRlcG9uMi1XVFM4Q1UzaU9BZ1A4QzE5dUMtaGNTT3o1Qi1QdkFSWVpURU5laG5BZ0U5aURYN3lVY3VDaVJhejBDbFltTTY3VTVfZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;(Photo Credit: @heyitsgingerandpepper / Instagram)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A romantic dinner can evoke warmth, excitement, and the joy of shared moments, even if one of the attendees happens to be a charming feline. In a delightful twist on a classic dinner date, an orange cat named Ginger has captured the hearts of viewers after a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFn2UpSyIQm/?igsh=MWpocnh3NXl1ajU2Mg==" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; featuring her waiting patiently for her date at a candle-lit table went viral on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cat waits patiently at a dinner date in viral video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Instagram video — shared by user @heyitsgingerandpepper — captures Ginger as she sits poised at a miniature table adorned with red roses, flickering candles, and even a bottle of Champagne. The setting, complete with rose petals scattered on the floor, sets the perfect scene for a romantic rendezvous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginger’s owner, Kim, humorously explained to &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/ginger-cat-sat-candle-lit-table-ready-her-date-waiting-you-1777552" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Newsweek;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; that the feline decided to mimic her “hoomans” by organizing a date night of her own. The feline feast featured cat wine and chicken cat food, followed by a cozy cuddle session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video’s charm has not gone unnoticed. It has quickly become a sensation among cat lovers on Instagram, amassing over 3 million likes and 7,480 comments as of Thursday. Comments from users express admiration for the cat’s demeanor and the overall scene. One user wrote, “Who would need a man when you have Ginger.” Another said, “Cutest Valentine!!!! Whomever spends Valentine’s Day with this cutie tomorrow, is one LUCKY individual!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenters also speculated about Ginger’s intentions, with one predicting a proposal and another joking that they’d rather be on this date than any they could find on dating apps. Others were moved by the cat’s apparent happiness and cuteness, suggesting they’d arrive “2 hours early just to have extra time” with Ginger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that cats do form attachments similar to those seen between children and their parents, which perhaps explains why so many people find such joy in Ginger’s video. Despite their &lt;a href="https://cattime.com/features/50660-are-cats-domesticated-science" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:independent nature;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;independent nature&lt;/a&gt;, studies have shown that cats feel comforted by their owners’ presence and can even experience distress when separated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://cattime.com/news/59928-video-cat-waiting-for-date-viral" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video of Cat ‘Patiently Waiting’ for Date Melts Hearts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Video of Cat ‘Patiently Waiting’ for Date Melts Hearts&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://cattime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CatTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CatTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 08:54:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPSlRDai1GQ2pVaVRKeHVpLTJHUjdERHhKdFM1UXVyT3U5MUI1TWsxV015S05ya25jVmRlcG9uMi1XVFM4Q1UzaU9BZ1A4QzE5dUMtaGNTT3o1Qi1QdkFSWVpURU5laG5BZ0U5aURYN3lVY3VDaVJhejBDbFltTTY3VTVfZw</guid></item><item><title>This Painful Syndrome Is Sending Cannabis Users to the ER – Are You at Risk? - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxPOG5fWXVPcEQ3M2JFQXhnVldiblZZdWJKT2JZNmNGYUdWdzhDMEtVeUpRRjFBN3JEZmhkYXFRWHhDUldZbGFTNU5rWE1fMTlYOWotU0Z2aGg0bkg2aHlHdHA1c3RxcFl4V0oyQ1hkbG9yRnpMdUJLZFc5RDhFTktkZ0V1YnpBdXgxVGtlM1B0ak5YVXlCR3FWaldveHNoNFdQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 08:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPOG5fWXVPcEQ3M2JFQXhnVldiblZZdWJKT2JZNmNGYUdWdzhDMEtVeUpRRjFBN3JEZmhkYXFRWHhDUldZbGFTNU5rWE1fMTlYOWotU0Z2aGg0bkg2aHlHdHA1c3RxcFl4V0oyQ1hkbG9yRnpMdUJLZFc5RDhFTktkZ0V1YnpBdXgxVGtlM1B0ak5YVXlCR3FWaldveHNoNFdQ</guid></item><item><title>Weekly News Quiz: Feb. 20 - AARP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNOXdNV2RYNTRzMldxdnpJTmx6MkNUM3drV0dUeHltbHlKV0RUMmhGX0JFWlhCUGJ5OVhMNXM4ZHhjenR4S1NBSGgta1lBb21uT1d1STJra0RQQ21WRWhFaHIzZjRwZVA4Ny1kN2VhZ3BFZ2N6eHhmbW54bXhka0tyWThn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="aarp-uxdia-leaving-modal-content aarp-uxdia-leaving-modal-content@tablet aarp-uxdia-leaving-modal-content@laptop"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Disposable plastic containers could be leaching dangerous chemicals into your takeaway food, potentially increasing your risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments on rats, researchers in China have found evidence that drinking water exposed to the various chemical additives that seep from heated plastic packaging causes changes to the body, that begin with altered gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodents that ingested this cocktail of plastic contaminants for just three months showed broken or misaligned fibers, inflammatory cell infiltration, and mitochondrial swelling in their heart tissue. They also showed bleeding between myocardial cells, as marked by the black pentagrams in the image below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152637" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152637" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-642x543.jpg" alt="Rat Heart Health" class="size-medium wp-image-152637" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-642x543.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-490x415.jpg 490w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-768x650.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-1536x1300.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-2048x1734.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr3_lrg-600x508.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152637" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Heart tissue of rodents in group A, B, C, and D, with D being the control group. The black arrow represents inflammatory cell infiltration, and the black pentagram represents intercardiomyocyte bleeding. (Wu et al., &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651324014593"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the same occurs in the human body is unknown, but the findings suggest that heated plastic containers may not be a safe vehicle for food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we wait for more research, the authors of the study at Ningxia Medical University in China &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651324014593"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt;, "It is essential to avoid using plastic containers for high-temperature food".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their experiments on rats were prompted by a survey of 3,179 older adults in China. Those who reported higher exposure to plastic on a questionnaire were more likely to suffer congestive heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other recent and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-found-in-blood-clots-in-heart-brain-and-legs"&gt;concerning research&lt;/a&gt; has found microplastics accumulating in blood clots within the human brain, heart, and legs, so epidemiologist Yueping Wu and their colleagues decided to investigate the cardiovascular effects further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of three months, they fed 24 rodents the chemicals that are leached from plastic containers when they are heated by boiling tap water, which include compounds such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-plastic-additives-may-have-affected-the-health-of-millions"&gt;BPA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-plastic-additives-may-have-affected-the-health-of-millions"&gt;phthalates&lt;/a&gt;, and various &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-shocked-at-daily-level-of-plasticizers-in-californias-air"&gt;plasticizers&lt;/a&gt;. These 'leachates' were produced by placing plastic containers in hot tap water for durations of 1, 5, and 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, rodents that drank the contaminated water had an altered intestinal microenvironment compared to the eight control rodents that did not. Their gut microbiomes had altered significantly after exposure to plastic and its chemicals, including changes to flora associated with inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blood of these exposed animals also showed a spike in inflammatory immune messengers, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These changes might be linked to plastic product leachates disrupting microbiota and inflammatory factors, which then trigger inflammation and myocardial damage," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651324014593"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152639" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152639" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-642x367.jpg" alt="Rat Heart Tissue " class="size-medium wp-image-152639" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-642x367.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-726x415.jpg 726w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-768x439.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-2048x1171.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/1-s2.0-S0147651324014593-gr4_lrg-600x343.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152639" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Myocardial tissue of rats exposed to plastic contaminants.

&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microwaving-safe-plastics-can-release-billions-of-particles-scientists-warn"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that microwaving plastic food containers can release microplastics and nanoplastics into the meal, even if the containers claim to be microwave-safe. As few as three minutes can release billions of tiny plastic particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152625" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152625" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MicrowavePlastic.jpg" alt="Microwave Plastic" class="size-full wp-image-152625" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MicrowavePlastic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/MicrowavePlastic-600x186.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152625" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Microwaving releases microplastics.

It's also a mystery as to how long the fragments stick around for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/plastic-found-in-more-than-50-of-plaques-from-clogged-arteries"&gt;Some studies&lt;/a&gt; on clogged arteries in human patients have found tiny fragments of plastic accumulating in more than 50 percent of plaques. Within roughly 34 months of surgery, those with plastics in their arteries were 4.5 times more likely to have a heart attack, stroke, or death compared to those where no plastic was detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the body is exposed to plastic contaminants, researchers suspect there's a chance the additives can reduce the activity of antioxidant enzymes and trigger the body's inflammatory reaction, leaving it exposed to cardiovascular damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152629" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152629" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy-642x297.png" alt="Plastics Microscopy" class="size-medium wp-image-152629" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy-642x297.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy-898x415.png 898w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy-768x355.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy-600x277.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PlasticsMicroscopy.png 1286w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152629" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Jagged plastic particles were seen inside macrophages and deposits of fatty tissue, removed from clogged arteries.

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132800"&gt;study published last year&lt;/a&gt;, scientists discovered that when people put hot, disposable plastic cutlery in their mouths, it reduces their diversity of intestinal microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;
