id="mol-5da7c400-1971-11f0-9775-517d25900f2f"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; — just past the cotton fields and under the relentless spring sun — Peter Hildebrand stands outside a gas station, his eyes rimmed red and voice cracking with grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She did not die of the measles,' he said of his daughter, Daisy. 'If there's one thing you should know, it's that. She was failed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand is the second child to die in the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14600461/Where-worlds-infectious-disease-spreading-US-24-states-report-cases.html"&gt;escalating measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; gripping West Texas, where antivaccine conspiracy thinking has become rife and there has been an erosion of trust in public institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The death was confirmed to be from measles by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-2bef6a60-1964-11f0-a36b-639c9a17c30a" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;). Hidlebrand, however, claims his daughter's death was not caused by the virus, but by a failure in her medical care, a lack of proper treatment and prejudice against their faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family are Mennonite, part of a small Christian community that often emphasizes 'natural remedies' over modern medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DailyMail.com spoke to several locals, including young mothers, farmhands and truckers, in Seminole who were skeptical about vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They falsely claimed &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14583809/rfk-jr-u-turn-mmr-vaccine-measles-outbreak-milestone.html"&gt;the vaccines contained 'dangerous stuff'&lt;/a&gt; and that big pharma used them to make money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vaccine exemptions in Gaines County, where Seminole is based, are among the highest in the state and nationwide. About 13 percent of children attending local schools have a conscientious exemption for vaccines, compared to three percent nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Seminole, Texas is at the center of a measles outbreak as antivaccine conspiracy thinking  becomes rife and trust in public institutions drops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is Peter Hildebrand with his wife Eva and two of his children. They met with anti-vaccine crusader RFK Jr, health secretary, after the death of their daughter &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand is the second child to die in the escalating measles outbreak gripping West Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daisy, once a healthy and energetic child, got sick about a month ago. She came down with a fever, sore throat, and eventually pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family tried to treat their daughter at home with cod liver oil, popular in the community for helping to 'strengthen the immune system'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when that failed, they took her to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors diagnosed her with strep throat, mononucleosis, a contagious viral infection, and measles. She was given antibiotics and sent home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But within three days, her condition worsened. Rushed back to the hospital with severe pneumonia, she was treated again — this time unsuccessfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daisy was the second child to die in the outbreak. Six-year-old Kayley Fehr, also unvaccinated and from the same Mennonite community, succumbed just weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They both mark the first deaths from measles in the US in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 700 cases of measles have been recorded nationwide so far this year, with 541 of these recorded in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This number of cases is the worst since 2019 and is on track to become the worst in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the Texas outbreak, 70 percent of cases - or more than two thirds - are among children and young babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though measles itself is viral, it weakens the immune system and leaves patients vulnerable to deadly secondary infections, especially pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Mr Hildebrand rejects that explanation in Daisy’s case — and places little faith in the vaccines public health officials are urging the community to adopt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The [MMR] vaccine ain't worth a damn,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My brother's family got it and they all still got sick — worse than my unvaccinated kids. This isn't about the vaccine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measles vaccine is 93 percent effective at preventing infections after one dose, and 97 percent effective after two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Joselyn doesn’t want to get her children vaccinated despite the outbreak because she claims to know people who’ve had adverse reactions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Judy said her family hasn’t got the MMR vaccine because they ‘don’t like the things in it’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without vaccination, however, there is a high risk of suffering from a measles infection - which is particularly dangerous in children under five years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In unvaccinated children, about one in five who are infected with measles are hospitalized, while one in 20 suffer from pneumonia, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in 1,000 will also develop encephalitis, a swelling on the brain that can lead to convulsions, going deaf and intellectual disability, and about one to three in every 1,000 die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Mennonite community's relationship with vaccination is complicated. Though scripture doesn't strictly forbid vaccines, many in the community believe it should be a personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 3,000 people in Gaines County follow the Mennonite faith, according to figures from 2010, out of the more than 22,000 residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, Gaines County has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country: just 82 percent of kindergartners received the MMR vaccine last year — far below the 95 percent threshold required for herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the outbreak, hesitancy remains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At Healthy 2 U, a Mennonite-run supplement shop in Seminole, shelves are stocked with cod liver oil rich in vitamin A — an alternative therapy promoted by some vaccine skeptics as a natural defense against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We recommend it to everyone who gets sick,' says store manager Nancy, a mother of 10 and grandmother of nineteen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there are some who are still in favor of vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a parking lot outside &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/walmart/index.html" id="mol-7b514a20-196d-11f0-a36b-639c9a17c30a" class=""&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, DailyMail.com met two Mennonite women — Helen and Helena. One said she vaccinated her children, saying it was the right thing to do, while the other said she didn't vaccinate her children believing infections like measles 'make their immune system stronger'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Steven, a local designer, said everyone should get vaccinated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the entry-way to the measles testing and vaccination center in West Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The town of Seminole, with just 7,000 residents, has been quietly grappling with the epidemic. Outside the local testing and vaccination clinic, DailyMail.com saw a slow trickle of patients — many coming for blood tests to determine if they have measles antibodies, a form of proof of immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, many in the town are skeptical. Some believe the outbreak is slowing; others say they're hearing of 'more patients than ever'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Local health director Zach Holbrooks says traffic to the clinic varies, with some days seeing no patients and others over a dozen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He urges vaccinations, calling them the best protection against hospitalization and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Signs around town warn of the outbreak, but they're easy to miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without large banners or public broadcasts, visitors may pass through Seminole and be completely unaware that the nation's worst measles outbreak in years is unfolding here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hildebrand is determined, however, to overturn the report that his daughter was killed by measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He recently met with RFK Jr during a visit to the area earlier this month. 'He didn't mention vaccines once,' Mr Hildebrand says. 'But he was the nicest man I ever met.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his visit, RFK Jr wrote on X: 'The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Daisy was laid to rest alongside Kayley in a modest Mennonite churchyard, her father hopes her story sparks reflection — if not on vaccines, then on care, compassion, and the urgent need to protect the vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She was my little girl,' he says softly. 'And they let her down.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The virus is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14474859/gene-hackman-wife-betsy-arakawa-death-hantavirus-symptoms.html"&gt;rare in the US&lt;/a&gt;, with fewer than 50 cases reported yearly. For reference, there are roughly 2,000 cases of West Nile Virus reported in the US annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is partly because the US has fewer rodent species than Asian countries. Hantaviruses in the US primarily circulate in fewer rodent species compared to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/asia/index.html" id="mol-28cee9f0-1937-11f0-85d1-d5db88e7340b"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; and Europe, where multiple rodent species act as hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/virginia/index.html" id="mol-c1b28bd0-1974-11f0-85f0-113a49f63e3e"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; Tech researchers found that while deer mice are still the primary reservoir for hantaviruses in North America, the virus circulates more widely than previously thought – detecting antibodies in six additional rodent species where hantavirus was not documented before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings suggest that hantaviruses may circulate among a broader range of rodents, though human infection risk is still highest in areas with high deer mouse populations, especially in Southwestern states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Betsy Arakawa was found dead in the Santa Fe home she shared with her husband, Gene Hackman, and the mysterious circumstances surrounding their passing gripped the nation’s attention for weeks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hantaviruses, which kill around 50 percent of patients, are a group of viruses found worldwide and can cause deadly diseases with fatality rates comparable to serious illnesses like Ebola, which has a death rate ranging from about 60 to as much as 90 percent, depending on the strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hantaviruses, which are spread to people when they inhale aerosolized fecal matter, urine, or saliva from infected rodents, cause distinct diseases based on their geographic regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Asia, the Hantaan virus causes hemorrhagic fever with kidney disease, while in Europe, the same condition is linked to the Dobrava-Belgrade virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the Americas, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is caused by the Sin Nombre virus and the Andes virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Sin Nombre virus was first identified in New Mexico in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Virginia Tech team &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/04/hantavirus-environmental-factors-influence-distribution-paanwaris-paansri-luis-escobar.html"&gt;analyzed data&lt;/a&gt; from the National Science Foundation's National Ecological Observatory Network to better understand how hantavirus spreads in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They focused on how environmental factors and geographic patterns affect the rodent species that carry the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Arakawa was infected with hantavirus which caused a deadly build-up of fluid in her lungs, known medically as hentavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Hackman died of heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Seventy-nine percent of positive blood samples came from deer mice species, which cause around 90 percent of all hantavirus cases in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 2014 and 2019, the program gathered and tested 14,004 blood samples from 49 different species at 45 locations across the US to test for levels of hantavirus antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seventy-nine percent of positive blood samples came from deer mice species, which cause around 90 percent of all hantavirus cases in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These species showed the highest infection rates in their blood at three percent based on 116 positive samples, which was to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, researchers found that some rodent species, like Peromyscus truei and Microtus pennsylvanicus, had a higher percentage of hantavirus infections than deer mice – between 4.3 and 4.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Paanwaris Paansri, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation and co-author of the study, said: ‘In North America, Peromyscus maniculatus, the deer mouse, is the most common carrier, but our study also revealed that other rodent species have a higher prevalence of hantavirus, which changes the current paradigm in hantavirus circulation in wildlife.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, these numbers can be misconstrued to pose a greater threat than actually exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are based on much smaller sample sizes: only nine out of 184 P. truei and 33 out of 768 M. pennsylvanicus tested positive. Meanwhile, 116 out of 3,919 deer mice were infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the sample is small, even a few positive cases can skew the percentage to appear high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows hantavirus cases recorded in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vast majority of human cases are traced back to two or three key deer mouse species, and there is no evidence these species sustain outbreaks or significantly increase human risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, according to Mr Paansri, these findings reveal that the virus is more flexible than scientists once thought, broadening what they know about its basic biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Virginia had the highest infection rate among rodents, with nearly eight percent of 99 samples testing positive for hantavirus – 3.8 times the national average of around two percent.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorado had the second-highest infection rate, followed by Texas, both known risk regions for the virus, with average positive blood samples more than twice as high as the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team’s findings could influence how public health officials monitor and evaluate hantavirus risk and help clarify human cases in areas where the usual rodent host is uncommon or missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Paansri said: ‘This new information is expected to help us understand where and when hantavirus is most likely to occur, which is crucial for predicting outbreaks and informing public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We believe that many lessons learned from this study can be generalized to other wildlife diseases, considering that their distribution is global.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 00:55:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>随着神秘的大脑疾病在美国不太可能的县蔓延，医生发出警报-每日邮报 | Doctors sound alarm as mystery brain disease spreads in unlikely US county - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two people in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/oregon/index.html" id="mol-5d9ada70-196b-11f0-85d1-d5db88e7340b"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; have died of a rare brain disorder that causes dementia-like symptoms without a clear cause or possible link tying the deaths together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials in Hood River County, home to about 24,000 people in northern Oregon, have identified three cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease over the past eight months, two of which have been fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is rare - infecting about 350 Americans per year - but it is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13261007/michigan-woman-dies-rare-fatal-brain-disease-cjd.html"&gt;almost always fatal&lt;/a&gt;. The disease, which causes&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14599453/harvard-experts-overlooked-risk-factors-dementia-preventable.html"&gt; a rapid descent into dementia&lt;/a&gt;, is caused by faulty proteins in the brain called prions that corrupt healthy ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The underlying trigger of CJD remains unclear and most cases are sporadic with no known cause. However, some forms are genetic or linked to contaminated beef. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not spread from person-to-person unless in the case of infected transplanted organs, and Oregon officials do not know if the state's cases are related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One patient was confirmed by autopsy to have died of CJD, while the other death is believed to be caused by CJD. State pathologists are examining brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid, one of the two ways to diagnose CJD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rarely, a brain biopsy is performed to confirm the disease, which involves surgically removing brain tissue and often results in brain bleeding, infection, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A third person suspected of having the disease is still alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Trish Elliott, director of Hood River County Health Department, said: ‘We’re trying to look at any common risk factors that might link these cases … but it’s pretty hard in some cases to come up with what the real cause is.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Panel B shows a section of the cerebral cortex where prions have killed white matter in the brain, creating lots of tiny holes, a pattern called “status spongiosis,” caused by severe nerve cell loss. Panel C shows severe damage in the deeper layer of white matter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials declined to give personal details on the patients or say whether the three cases were from the same household or family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A variant of CJD has been tied to eating meat from cattle infected with mad cow disease, another prion disorder, but Elliott said the cases in Hood River are not believed to be linked to cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eighty-five percent of CJD cases are ‘sporadic,’ meaning they have no apparent cause or recognizable pattern of spreading, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;according &lt;/a&gt;to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 10 to 14 percent of CJD cases are caused by mutations in the PRNP gene, which encodes for the prion protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The remaining one percent are caused by external factors, such as eating infected beef or undergoing medical procedures with infected tools or receiving transplanted organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It typically affects people in their 50s and older and presents as rapid degeneration of brain tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients usually die within four or five months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are outliers, though. A 22-year-old college student &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncel.2024.1518542/full"&gt;lived for seven months&lt;/a&gt; with progressively worsening dementia tied to CJD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Prion diseases primarily affect people in their 50s and older and presents as rapid degeneration of brain tissue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A previously high-functioning college student, she returned home from school and began experiencing severe anxiety, prompting treatment with benzodiazepines prescribed by a doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, her symptoms worsened. She experienced hallucinations, sleepwalking, and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also developed repetitive behaviors and became fixated on completing tasks like handwashing and toothbrushing in a precise manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She soon began to experience cognitive issues, including memory problems, trouble doing familiar tasks, and forgetting the names of close family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors performed MRIs, cerebral spinal fluid tests, and genetic testing to determine the cause and suspected it to be CJD. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn’t confirmed until the patient died, though, by examining brain tissue in the lab, spotting the sponge-like holes indicative of CJD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early signs of the disease include unexplained mood shifts, irritability, paranoia, delusions and other symptoms of psychosis, and social withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the following weeks or months, CJD causes aggression, confusion, memory loss, inability to speak or eat, and incontinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hood River County Health Department did not disclose when the three cases first became sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials issued a warning to local health workers to keep CJD in mind when they treat patients exhibiting signs of rapid descent into dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They maintain that the risk to the public is low.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 00:54:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>研究发现， CT扫描可能导致5%的癌症；专家指出不确定性- Ars Technica | CT scans could cause 5% of cancers, study finds; experts note uncertainty - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxNank5V2ZFeVZHek1HLWFKWUpGSGx1UEhKekJQVDJzUjdOSU1yQ2loblNRS2Q4UUIzQlRjaTJoN3cwNTJjWDZXc1dZaFU4eXdiaXlhb0NPUFBiVFRnNXJMS2I4Vm1YZUkxNWc3a2pRQlF4Y3dIR3Q0di16MWMxcThfQm15blVJR3hhQlQxUThSVURpM3ZXLXlNU1RzMUxreFpwaUJrcEUwaTRHZUVzTlpB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;Uncertainty and balancing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The estimates, while based on the best models available to the authors, are indirect, so there is considerable uncertainty about the estimates," Stephen Duffy, emeritus professor of Cancer Screening at Queen Mary University of London, said in a statement. "Thus, I would say to patients that if you are recommended to have a CT scan, it would be wise to do so."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duffy also highlighted that in the context of a person's overall risk of cancer, CT scans don't move the needle much. There were a little over 100,000 cancers linked to 93 million scans. "This amounts to around a 0.1 percent increase in cancer risk over the patient's lifetime per CT examination," he said. The lifetime risk of cancer in the US population is &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/understanding-cancer-risk/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer.html"&gt;around 40 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the additional risk from CT scans "is small." Overall, when a CT scan is deemed necessary, the "likely benefit in diagnosis and subsequent treatment of disease outweighs the very small increase in cancer risk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doreen Lau, a cancer biology expert at Brunel University of London, agreed: "The findings don’t mean that people should avoid CT scans when recommended by a doctor. In most cases, the benefit of detecting or ruling out serious illness far outweighs the very small risk of harm."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the rise in CT scans in recent years may suggest that doctors could cut back on their use. In &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832782"&gt;an accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt;, Ilana Richman of Yale University and Mitchell Katz of NYC Health and Hospitals discussed ways that doctors could make sure they're balancing risks and benefits before using CT scans, including using diagnostic algorithms and offering alternative imaging options, such as ultrasounds and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As with all complex problems, there will be no simple solution," they write. But, "educating clinicians about avoiding low-value testing and, in circumstances where alternatives are readily available, involving patients in the decision to do a CT scan may help shift culture and practice."&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Measles is an extremely contagious disease. It's also extremely preventable. There's a vaccine. It's highly effective. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For decades it has made measles outbreaks in the U.S. relatively rare, and measles deaths rarer still. But the U.S. has now seen more than&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/08/nx-s1-5342706/texas-measles-outbreak-vaccine-seminole-gaines"&gt; 700 measles cases this year&lt;/a&gt;, and 3 deaths so far with active outbreaks across six states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The federal response is under scrutiny because Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has made a career spreading false information about vaccines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are this administration's views on vaccines, and what do they mean for what is already one of the worst U.S. measles outbreaks this century. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281452/trump-cabinet-picks-rfk-confirmation-hearing-help-committee"&gt;publicly promised &lt;/a&gt;he would support vaccines. Dr. Peter Marks, who was forced out as the nation's top vaccine regulator says his department isn't doing enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sponsor-free episodes of &lt;em&gt;Consider This,&lt;/em&gt; sign up for C&lt;em&gt;onsider This+&lt;/em&gt; via Apple Podcasts or at &lt;a href="http://plus.npr.org/"&gt;plus.npr.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Email us at&lt;a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org"&gt; considerthis@npr.org&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

Cording says this is one of the most common signs that you're not having enough protein. Protein helps you to feel full, and if you're not getting enough, you may end up hungry again pretty soon after you eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“If someone is constantly hungry, I’m always going to check to make sure they have enough protein,” Cording says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="your-cuts-and-scrapes-take-a-while-to-heal" data-node-id="11" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;2) Your cuts and scrapes take a while to heal. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Protein is essential for wound-healing because it provides the basis for building new tissue and collagen, which are needed for your body’s repair and growth, Cording explains. “Sometimes when you don’t eat enough protein, your body doesn’t repair as well,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="youre-not-building-muscle" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;3) You’re not building muscle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Yep, even if you're going hard on the weights, a diet that lacks protein means you won't really see much improvement in muscle mass. Of course, you won’t build muscle by eating protein alone, but if you're running into this issue, Cording says to reassess your protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If you struggle to meet their daily protein needs within your regular meals, you can also opt for a protein powder to give yourself a little boost.

But if you feel like there’s no obvious reason for your hair loss, protein could be a culprit, according to &lt;a href="http://www.goldenbergdermatology.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://www.goldenbergdermatology.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gary Goldenberg" data-node-id="18.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Gary Goldenberg&lt;/a&gt;, MD, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Hair follicles are constantly cycling through growth (anagen), transition (catagen), and resting (telogen) phases,” he explains. “Proteins are needed to support this constant turn over.” If you don’t have enough protein, new healthy anagen follicles can’t be produced—and you can end up losing hair, Dr. Goldenberg says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Of course, upping your protein intake isn't always a magic solution. “While in most [people] this process can be repaired by an increase in protein intake, in some patients it can become chronic and long term,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="your-nails-are-brittle" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;5) Your nails are brittle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64312856/minoxidil-nail-growth/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64312856/minoxidil-nail-growth/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nails" data-node-id="22.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Nails&lt;/a&gt; are mostly made of keratin, which is a form of protein. When there’s not enough protein in your diet, you can’t make and produce enough keratin, leading to brittle nails, Goldenberg says. Cue the dry and fragile nails. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Of course, calcium, vitamin C, biotin (vitamin B7), and vitamin E are &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a43099664/how-to-strengthen-nails/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a43099664/how-to-strengthen-nails/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="key players here, too" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;key players here, too&lt;/a&gt;.

Developed by researchers who altered just two atoms in LSD’s structure, JRT maintains the psychedelic’s neuroplastic effects while avoiding its psychosis-linked risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mouse models, JRT enhanced synaptic growth, boosted antidepressant effects, and improved cognitive flexibility—key challenges in schizophrenia treatment. These findings support the idea that psychedelics can be safely reengineered to unlock brain repair without perceptual side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Neuroplasticity:&lt;/strong&gt; JRT increased dendritic spine density by 46% and synapse density by 18%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Hallucinogenic Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike LSD, JRT did not produce hallucinogenic behavior or schizophrenia-linked gene expression in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potent Antidepressant:&lt;/strong&gt; JRT demonstrated antidepressant effects 100 times more potent than ketamine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Davis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University of California, Davis researchers have developed a new, neuroplasticity-promoting drug closely related to LSD that harnesses the psychedelic’s therapeutic power with reduced hallucinogenic potential.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,&lt;/em&gt; highlights the new drug’s potential as a treatment option for conditions like schizophrenia, where psychedelics are not prescribed for safety reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compound also may be useful for treating other neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases characterized by synaptic loss and brain atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108750"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a head and neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-psychopharmacology-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;JRT exhibited powerful neuroplastic effects and improved measures in mice relevant to the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, without exacerbating behaviors and gene expression associated with psychosis. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To design the drug, dubbed JRT, researchers flipped the position of just two atoms in LSD’s molecular structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chemical flip reduced JRT’s hallucinogenic potential while maintaining its neurotherapeutic properties, including its ability to spur neuronal growth and repair damaged neuronal connections that are often observed in the brains of those with neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Basically, what we did here is a tire rotation,” said corresponding author David E. Olson, director of the Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics and a professor of chemistry, and biochemistry and molecular medicine at UC Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By just transposing two atoms in LSD, we significantly improved JRT’s selectivity profile and reduced its hallucinogenic potential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JRT exhibited powerful neuroplastic effects and improved measures in mice relevant to the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, without exacerbating behaviors and gene expression associated with psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No one really wants to give a hallucinogenic molecule like LSD to a patient with schizophrenia,” said Olson, who is also co-founder and chief innovation officer of Delix Therapeutics, a company that aims to bring neuroplastogens to the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The development of JRT emphasizes that we can use psychedelics like LSD as starting points to make better medicines. We may be able to create medications that can be used in patient populations where psychedelic use is precluded.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing JRT’s potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olson said that it took his team nearly five years to complete the 12-step synthesis process to produce JRT. The molecule was named after Jeremy R. Tuck, a former graduate student in Olson’s laboratory, who was the first to synthesize it and is a co-first author of the study along with Lee E. Dunlap, another former graduate student in Olson’s laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following JRT’s successful synthesis, the researchers conducted a battery of cellular and mouse assays that demonstrated the drug’s neuroplastic effects and improved safety profile relative to LSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;JRT and LSD have the exact same molecular weight and overall shape, but distinct pharmacological properties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JRT is very potent and highly selective for binding to serotonin receptors, specifically 5-HT2A receptors, the activation of which are key to promoting cortical neuron growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JRT promoted neuroplasticity, or growth between cellular connections in the brain, leading to a 46% increase in dendritic spine density and an 18% increase in synapse density in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JRT did not produce hallucinogenic-like behaviors that are typically seen when mice are dosed with LSD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JRT did not promote gene expression associated with schizophrenia. Such gene expression is typically amplified with LSD use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JRT produced robust anti-depressant effects, with it being around 100-fold more potent than ketamine, the state-of-the-art fast-acting anti-depressant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;JRT promoted cognitive flexibility, successfully addressing deficits in reversal learning that are associated with schizophrenia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“JRT has extremely high therapeutic potential. Right now, we are testing it in other disease models, improving its synthesis, and creating new analogues of JRT that might be even better,” Olson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A more effective treatment for schizophrenia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olson emphasized JRT’s potential for treating the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, as most current treatments produce limited effects on anhedonia — the inability to feel pleasure — and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clozapine is the one exception, but it has side effects, and is not first-line drug of choice for people severely afflicted with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olson and his team are currently testing JRT’s potential against other neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional coauthors include Yara A.

A large-scale meta-analysis of over 400,000 participants revealed that digital engagement correlates with a 58% lower risk of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology challenges the brain, fosters social connection, and enables compensatory tools like reminders and GPS that support independence.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a new study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt; by neuroscientists at Baylor University and the University of Texas at Austin Dell Medical School reveals the opposite – digital technologies are actually associated with &lt;em&gt;reduced &lt;/em&gt;cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study – &lt;em&gt;A meta-analysis of technology use and cognitive aging&lt;/em&gt; – was sparked by the ongoing concern about the passive activity of digital technologies and their relation to accelerating risks of dementia. Study co-authors are Jared F. Benge, Ph.D., clinical neuropsychologist and associate professor of neurology at Dell Medical School and UT Health Austin’s Comprehensive Memory Center within the Mulva Clinic for the Neurosciences, and Michael K. Scullin, Ph.D., associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can flip on the news on just about any day and you’ll see people talking about how technologies are harming us,” Scullin said. “People often use the terms ‘brain drain’ and ‘brain rot,’ and now digital dementia is an emerging phrase. As researchers, we wanted to know if this was true.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “digital dementia” hypothesis predicts that a lifetime of exposure to digital technology will worsen cognitive abilities. On the contrary, the study’s findings challenge this hypothesis, indicating instead that engagement with digital technology fosters cognitive resilience in these adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviewing more than 136 studies with data that encompassed over 400,000 adults, and longitudinal studies with an average of 6 years of follow-up data, Scullin and Benge found compelling evidence that digital technology use is associated with better cognitive aging outcomes, rather than harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ study supported the “technological reserve” hypothesis, finding that digital technologies can promote behaviors that preserve cognition. In fact, their study revealed that digital technology use correlates with a 58% lower risk of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern of cognitive protection persisted when the researchers controlled for socioeconomic status, education, age, gender, baseline cognitive ability, social support, overall health, and engagement with mental activities like reading that might have explained the findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase in problem-solving skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scullin said that for some, these findings are surprising as technology use is often associated with being sedentary both physically and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, for the current generation of older adults who were introduced to the first technological advancements – computers, the Internet and smartphones – past their childhood, using technology is cognitively challenging because it is everchanging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the first things that middle-age and older adults were saying is that ‘I’m so frustrated by this computer. This is hard to learn.’ That’s actually a reflection of the cognitive challenge, which may be beneficial for the brain even if it doesn’t feel great in the moment.” Scullin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology requires constant adaption, he said, such as understanding new software updates, troubleshooting Internet loss or filtering out website ads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re doing that for years and you’re really engaging with it, even though you might experience frustration, that may be a sign of you exercising your brain,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology also enables communication and engagement like never before, which can expand opportunities for connectivity. Video calls, emails and messaging apps help maintain social networks, especially for people who would not otherwise regularly see their family members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now you can connect with families across generations,” Scullin said. “You not only can talk to them, you can see them. You can share pictures. You can exchange emails and it’s all within a second or less. So that means there’s a greater opportunity for decreasing loneliness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better social connectedness is a well-documented correlate of cognitive functioning in older adults, providing a link between decreased isolation from digital technologies and reduced risks of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact of “digital scaffolding”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dementia diagnosis is indicated in part when cognitive changes lead to a loss of independence with daily tasks. Tools such as digital reminders, GPS navigation and online banking allow older adults to remain independent despite cognitive difficulties through digital scaffolding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the research article, this digital scaffold “facilitates better functional outcomes in older adults while general cognitive functioning declines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technologies can serve as a compensatory support system to maintain general independence and reduce the risk of a dementia diagnosis even with the presence of some cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As clinical practice continues to move toward an individualized, precision-medicine approach, it will be necessary for the field to identify for whom and for how long, such digital scaffolding is effective,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promoting healthy technology use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Scullin recognizes the negative effects of technology, such as distracted driving or using technology over consistent face-to-face interaction, he also emphasizes how promoting a healthy use of digital tools in older adults is beneficial for their cognitive health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have a parent or grandparent who’s just staying away from technology, maybe revisit that. Could they learn to use photo, messaging, or calendar apps on a smartphone or tablet? Start simple and be very patient while they learn,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media use is another highly debated topic in terms of cognitive effects. While he says it’s hard to predict the cognitive effects of endlessly scrolling on TikTok, Scullin does argue that generating videos through creative cognition could be beneficial. In addition, he said that interacting with communities online can provide benefits by forming social connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We could spend a long time talking about all the specific ways in which technology use can be bad. However, the net effect since the 1990s has been positive for overall cognition in older adults,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUNDING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health (R01AG082783; M.K.S., J.F.B.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurotech and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#611209040d03183e020407001300151508210300180d0e134f040514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Shelby Cefaratti-Bertin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://baylor.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Shelby Cefaratti-Bertin – Baylor College of Medicine&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02159-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A meta-analysis of technology use and cognitive aging&lt;/a&gt;” by Jared F.

Has technological exposure helped or harmed cognition in digital pioneers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The digital dementia hypothesis predicts that a lifetime of technology exposure worsens cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alternative hypothesis is that such exposures lead to technological reserve, wherein digital technologies promote behaviours that preserve cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested these hypotheses in a meta-analysis and systematic review of studies published in Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Science Direct, Scopus, Cochrane Library, ProQuest and Web of Science. Studies were included if they were observational or cohort studies focused on general digital technology use in older adults (over age 50) and included either a cognitive or dementia diagnosis outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified 136 papers that met inclusion criteria, of which 57 were compatible with odds ratio or hazard ratio meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies included 411,430 adults (baseline age M = 68.7 years; 53.5% female) from cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies (range: 1–18 years, M = 6.2 years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of digital technologies was associated with reduced risk of cognitive impairment (OR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.35–0.52) and reduced time-dependent rates of cognitive decline (HR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.66–0.84). Effects remained significant when accounting for demographic, socioeconomic, health and cognitive reserve proxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All studies were evaluated for quality on the basis of a standardized checklist; the primary outcomes replicated when limiting analyses to the highest-quality studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional work is needed to test bidirectional causal interpretations, understand mechanisms that underpin technological reserve, and identify how types and timings of technology exposures influence cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 19:53:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFBEZ2Z6SnpfeGxuVWV6Q1k3N1cyaHFGeGJTeC04WDVRMjJIQ2M4bEVTcHFHNlU3dy1ONXZMQTFoRi1ySkhCcmhtNWlzaDZFcnptT1pQck9kQjR4SnFLLV8xeDRxSllGRFdn</guid></item><item><title>在美国奶牛和家禽中发现更多H5N1 ；世卫组织发布H5监测指南- CIDRAP | More H5N1 detections in US dairy cows and poultry; WHO unveils H5 surveillance guide - CIDRAP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxQOHVNWGV1QXhQNGhjM2JkTmV6RF8tdmdScmRQcE1SN2U4QUFxZjVGbjNWRDJBa2FoVjBNT3p1X0dtcXFkcm85YlNoaTNMemlOLVcxdFRQWFBFYUxVM0hDY2VSdWFtUWd3dDY3bXQxdWw4V2E4a3k5N0o0bERSZWRXY2YtSUNTcnN2UnV3ZDVGX3FjY1otMWh5ZXFSdm0yMlY2M25BTENzdjN6bUxRVmFBSDJ1N25Ed1RNSUw3Z2RqV3BrVWFr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-right"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many cases of tuberculosis (TB) in prisons in Europe and the Americas during the COVID-19 pandemic were likely missed, putting both inmates and the community at risk for the deadly bacterial disease, Boston University (BU)-led researchers propose in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00325-6/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Lancet Public Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study team analyzed data from the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Pan American Health Organization (PAHO; 22 of 39 countries) and WHO Europe (25 of 53 countries) to model and predict prison populations and TB infections among 4.9 million inmates from 2020 to 2022. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Case notifications fall up to 100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;TB notifications in prisons were much lower than predicted in 2020 (-26.2%), 2021 (-46.4%), and 2022 (-48.9%). These trends were consistent across Europe and the Americas, but larger drops occurred in countries with lower TB rates (low burden) in 2020 (-54.8%) and 2021 (-68.4%), high-burden settings in 2021 (-89.4%), and Central and North America in 2021 (-100.3%).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reasons for this change in tuberculosis notifications might be multifactorial and include missed diagnoses and implementation of COVID-19 pandemic measures, reducing transmission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Incarceration rates were similar to predicted levels (under 10% overall difference) during the entire pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Reasons for this change in tuberculosis notifications might be multifactorial and include missed diagnoses and implementation of COVID-19 pandemic measures, reducing transmission," the authors wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a BU &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1078853"&gt;&lt;span&gt;news release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, first author Amy Zheng, MPH, a PhD student, said, "When countries are unable to detect tuberculosis in high-risk populations—such as people who are incarcerated—it increases the risk of transmission, both within prisons and to the broader community, when people are released from prison."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a related &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(25)00012-X/fulltext"&gt;&lt;span&gt;commentary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Emma Plugge, MD, PhD, of the University of Southampton in England, and Nicola Cocco, MD, of ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo in Milan, Italy, said that while prisons released some inmates to slow COVID-19 transmission, the efforts were inconsistent across countries and didn't result in meaningful population decreases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Efforts to tackle tuberculosis inside prisons must be redoubled as they have outside," they wrote. "Such actions will have a positive effect on the whole community; no one is safe until we are all safe."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Researchers studied individuals with Urbach-Wiethe disease, a rare condition that selectively damages the BLA, using economic games to assess generosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While patients were just as generous as controls toward close friends, they were significantly more selfish toward strangers and acquaintances. These findings suggest that the BLA doesn’t create prosocial behavior, but regulates when and how it occurs depending on social context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role of the BLA:&lt;/strong&gt; The basolateral amygdala helps adjust generosity depending on emotional closeness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urbach-Wiethe Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals with BLA damage were less generous toward distant social contacts but acted normally with close friends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Calibration:&lt;/strong&gt; The BLA doesn’t drive altruism but fine-tunes prosocial responses based on relationship strength.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;HHU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there areas of the brain, which regulate prosocial, altruistic behaviour? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with colleagues from the universities in Lausanne, Utrecht and Cape Town, researchers from Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf (HHU) have studied a very special group of patients and established that the “basolateral amygdala” (part of the limbic system) plays an important role in this. In the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;), they describe that this region calibrates social behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108742"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-generosity-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This disease causes selective damage to the so-called basolateral amygdala (for short: BLA) without impacting other areas of the brain. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosocial behaviour, i.e. helping others, is a cornerstone of human interaction. Yet, the neuronal mechanisms that determine this behaviour vis-à-vis different social constellations are not yet fully understood, so the question remains: How does prosocial behaviour change depending on how much, or little, decision-makers care about each other emotionally?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researching this objectively is no easy task. However, a special research environment presented itself in South Africa. Professor Dr Tobias Kalenscher, head of the “Comparative Psychology” research team at HHU and lead author of the study in PNAS: “It was a unique opportunity to work on site with a group of patients who suffer from the extremely rare ‘Urbach-Wiethe Disease’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disease causes selective damage to the so-called basolateral amygdala (for short: BLA) without impacting other areas of the brain. The emotional life and social behaviour of Urbach-Wiethe subjects differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, they find it difficult to recognise the emotional meaning of facial expressions. There are less than 150 known cases worldwide, but a larger group of Urbach-Wiethe subjects lives in Namaqualand in northern South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These patients represent a quasi-natural experimental environment for questions about prosocial behaviour,” adds Professor Kalenscher. “In the case of these individuals, exactly those areas of the brain are affected, which are believed to play a key role in compassionate behaviour toward others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers from Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and South Africa conducted so-called “dictator games” with the study participants – a special constellation from game theory in which the participants are asked to distribute sums of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were allowed to decide how much money they wanted to share with other people – close friends, acquaintances, neighbours or strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luca M. Lüpken, co-author of the study and doctoral researcher at HHU: “The results were clear: Individuals with BLA damage were just as generous toward people they were close to as healthy control participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, as soon as it came to individuals with whom they had less of an emotional connection, they were notably more selfish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors therefore conclude that the BLA is not fundamentally necessary for altruism, but that it helps regulate the degree of generosity depending on the social distance between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this form of calibration is missing, the natural tendency to prioritise personal well-being over that of others dominates, meaning that affected individuals tend to act more selfishly. Only a strong emotional attachment – like that between best friends – brings about greater generosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lüpken: “Our study shows that the amygdala does not generally promote or inhibit prosocial behaviour, but rather regulates when and to what extent we act in a prosocial way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings explain the biological foundations for human social behaviour. They can also be important for gaining a better understanding of other conditions such as autism or psychopathy where social decisions are often different from those of healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Kalenscher places the findings in a wider context: “Social decisions are not only shaped by our upbringing or culture.

Scientists found that changes in gut-derived metabolites are linked to differences in brain structure and function in children with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gut-brain communication appears to impact emotional processing and social behaviors, shedding light on why gastrointestinal issues are so common in autism. The study raises the possibility of new therapies that target gut health to alleviate autism-related symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbiome-Brain Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Gut bacteria influence brain activity by affecting tryptophan metabolism and serotonin production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bidirectional Signals:&lt;/strong&gt; 90% of neural signals between the gut and brain travel from the gut to the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autism Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Altered gut metabolites correlate with behavioral symptoms and brain activity differences in children with autism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;USC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new USC study suggests that gut imbalances in children with autism may create an imbalance of metabolites in the digestive system — ultimately disrupting neurotransmitter production and influencing behavioral symptoms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published Monday in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, adds to a growing body of science implicating the “gut-brain” axis in autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108738"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gut-brain-ASD-behavior-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gut-brain-ASD-behavior-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gut-brain-ASD-behavior-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gut-brain-ASD-behavior-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gut-brain-ASD-behavior-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gut-brain-ASD-behavior-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gut-brain-ASD-behavior-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gut-brain-ASD-behavior-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a head and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gut-brain-ASD-behavior-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gut-brain-ASD-behavior-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gut-brain-ASD-behavior-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gut-brain-ASD-behavior-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gut-brain-ASD-behavior-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gut-brain-ASD-behavior-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gut-brain-ASD-behavior-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Since much of the body’s serotonin originates in the gut microbiome, changes in gut health can influence serotonin production. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery raises the possibility of new treatment avenues. It’s an example of how research at USC, and other universities, drives innovation and leads to discoveries that improve lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We demonstrated that gut metabolites impact the brain, and the brain, in turn, affects behavior. Essentially, the brain acts as the intermediary between gut health and autism-related behaviors,” said first author Lisa Aziz-Zadeh, a professor at the Brain and Creativity Institute at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previous studies highlighted differences in gut microbiomes and brain structures in autism, but our research connects the dots.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut-brain connection is not as far-fetched as it might seem. From an evolutionary perspective, the gut was likely the first “brain,” explained Aziz-Zadeh, who also is a professor at USC Dornsife’s Department of Psychology and the USC Mrs. T.H. Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, most of the neurons from the gut send signals to the brain; there are actually more neurons in the gut than in the spinal cord. About 90% of the neural signals between the gut and brain travel from the gut to the brain, while only 10% go in the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;‘Gut instinct’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This constant communication explains why we talk about “gut instinct” or “feeling it in your gut.” Many emotions are processed through gut-related mechanisms, a concept known as interoception — the perception of internal bodily sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers collected behavioral data, brain imaging data and stool samples from 43 children with autism and 41 neurotypical children aged 8-17. From the stool samples, they analyzed metabolites produced by gut bacteria that break down food in the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then correlated these metabolites with brain differences observed in children with autism and their behavioral characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They homed in on the “tryptophan pathway” by which tryptophan, an amino acid found in many foods, is broken down into several metabolites, including serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is crucial for emotional processing, social interaction, learning and other brain functions. Since much of the body’s serotonin originates in the gut microbiome, changes in gut health can influence serotonin production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that children with autism have brain differences — certain parts of their brain are either less active or more active compared to typically developing children,” Aziz-Zadeh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also know they often experience gastrointestinal issues, such as constipation, stomach pain and other digestive problems. Additionally, autism is associated with various symptoms, including repetitive behaviors and social difficulties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sofronia Ringold, a doctoral student at the Brain and Creativity Institute who worked on the study, said she was excited by the possibility of interventions that might target the gut and influence neural activity and behavior “while also hopefully alleviating some of the symptoms that are the most uncomfortable for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to Aziz-Zadeh and Ringold, other authors of the study are Aditya Jayashankar, Emily Kilroy, Ravi Bhatt, and Christiana Butera of USC; and Jonathan Jacobs, Skylar Tanartkit, Swapna Joshi, Mirella Dapretto, Jennifer Labus, and Emeran Mayer, all of UCLA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by a grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (R01HD079432) and a grant from the Department of Defense’s Idea Development Award (AR170062).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this microbiome and autism research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://today.usc.edu/tag/leigh-hopper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leigh Hopper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://today.usc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;USC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Leigh Hopper – USC&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58459-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Relationships between brain activity, tryptophan-related gut metabolites, and autism symptomatology&lt;/a&gt;” by Lisa Aziz-Zadeh, et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationships between brain activity, tryptophan-related gut metabolites, and autism symptomatology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it has been suggested that alterations in the composition of gut microbial metabolites may play a causative role in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it is not known how gut microbial metabolites are associated with ASD-specific brain alterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this cross-sectional, case-control observational study, (i) fecal metabolomics, (ii) task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and (iii) behavioral assessments were obtained from 43 ASD and 41 neurotypical (NT) children, aged 8–17. The fMRI tasks used socio-emotional and sensory paradigms that commonly reveal strong evoked brain differences in ASD participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that fecal levels of specific tryptophan-related metabolites, including kynurenate, were significantly lower in ASD compared to NT, and were associated with: 1) alterations in insular and cingulate cortical activity previously implicated in ASD; and 2) ASD severity and symptoms (e.g., ADOS scores, disgust propensity, and sensory sensitivities).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, activity in the mid-insula and mid-cingulate significantly mediated relationships between the microbial tryptophan metabolites (indolelactate and tryptophan betaine) and ASD severity and disgust sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, we identify associations between gut microbial tryptophan metabolites, ASD symptoms, and brain activity in humans, particularly in brain regions associated with interoceptive processing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 19:08:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTE14ODdnb3JzYXJsYmY3X3VkNEtuSHRKS1FRSGp6SDd1dnVOTFBQTzFiSmxod2RBYmlXV0VVcXlfeDZZMmlQeVVMZE1ZYkg1b0o2UXZlcWNWOWRnQ0RVTFQzamVmUQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家在LSD中翻转两个原子–并解锁改变游戏规则的心理健康治疗- SciTechDaily | Scientists Flip Two Atoms in LSD – And Unlock a Game-Changing Mental Health Treatment - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxPT080N29pRE1BZklJX1Zfbmhkei1jeUVNOWxKeVhTM3VnT3daSzZIa3gyajBfeFRFNjJsbkRtdWN4ZndWVnBFdmNPTWVJVFUtcDNnRHgwbTRPX2h5Z0ZPNWhwNGxuVmR4YkNxRU55MHd2Qlo1dnZaRENVQnNDdTRBMVZodk8wWFd4Z182VnFWbnpZMWM5RVJmR0FMSDZVR1FNTGpDQzlDLVZKeHRuZ2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 19:00:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPT080N29pRE1BZklJX1Zfbmhkei1jeUVNOWxKeVhTM3VnT3daSzZIa3gyajBfeFRFNjJsbkRtdWN4ZndWVnBFdmNPTWVJVFUtcDNnRHgwbTRPX2h5Z0ZPNWhwNGxuVmR4YkNxRU55MHd2Qlo1dnZaRENVQnNDdTRBMVZodk8wWFd4Z182VnFWbnpZMWM5RVJmR0FMSDZVR1FNTGpDQzlDLVZKeHRuZ2c</guid></item><item><title>寻求大麻使用护理的老年人患痴呆症的风险更高-《纽约时报》 | Older People Seeking Care for Cannabis Use at Greater Risk for Dementia - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFAtSjFuMFBSTVctcU5SNEhDZThQZUFZSW1IWS0xbjJmYUdPQ1E0aFc1TXdUOEhodGRTUkxYdjBHTlJFc0tZcWFrcy1aWFNwakJqNUFDODVKaUg1QTJOUVhkM05KVzhOc2o5RGhzY2t0cVp0Wm5PNHBnU29FTkhMNzA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Middle-aged and older adults who sought hospital or emergency room care because of cannabis use were &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.0530?guestAccessKey=73717de7-423a-4500-b10c-0f5117d1f69b&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=041425" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;almost twice as likely to develop dementia&lt;/a&gt; over the next five years, compared with similar people in the general population, a large Canadian study reported on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When compared with adults who sought care for other reasons, the risk of developing dementia was still 23 percent higher among users of cannabis, the study also found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The study included the medical records of six million people in Ontario from 2008 to 2021.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reprinted with permission from &lt;a href="https://www.worldatlarge.news/2025/04/14/fish-oil-supplements-shown-to-be-more-effective-than-fish-for-getting-optimal-omega-3-intake/"&gt;World at Large.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a fascinating new study, several dozen participants were separated into groups and fed either a fish oil supplement or fish itself, and the supplement proved more effective at delivering omega-3 fatty acids into the body than the actual fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was for years the norm, and likely still is in some quarters, for physicians to recommend trying to get all vital nutrients from foods, and not to rely on supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the study at least has shown this to be wrong, as both white and oily fish weren’t able to replicate some of the more penetrative effects of omega-3 from a supplement. As a result, those who can’t afford to eat cod or salmon every day may need not worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strength of the study is that it was double-blinded and placebo controlled, meaning that neither the participants nor the scientists knew who got the fish oil and who ate fish, and in what combinations, a technique known as the “gold standard” in scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the data after the study had been concluded revealed that a rather complex marker of disease risk called extracellular vesicles had only been improved by the presence of an additional intake of omega-3 from a supplement, and not by the consumption of white or oily fish alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA are arguably the most important human nutrients for health and longevity. The P.hD. and science researcher Dr. Rhonda Patrick &lt;a href="https://www.foundmyfitness.com/topics/omega-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has a database of simple explanations&lt;/a&gt; on omega-3 that’s worth a read, and probably the most detailed informational resource on the internet for these valuable nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scope of their value in disease prevention and longevity is stunning. For example, one study Dr. Patrick cited shows that non-smokers with low omega-3 levels and daily smokers with high omega-3 levels&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522004737?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; have similar risk of death&lt;/a&gt; from cardiovascular disease, suggesting deficiency in omega-3 fatty acids is as great as risk of death as smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extracellular vesicles, the culprit in many diseases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this new paper &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/high-dose-fish-oil-supplements-are-more-effective-than-oily-fish-in-altering-the-number-and-function-of-extracellular-vesicles-in-healthy-human-subjects-a-randomized-doubleblind-placebocontrolled-parallel-trial/13CE2CDBF375E8DB55BD61D185CEAD1D?utm_source=klaviyo&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=%28Email%20-%20Chris%20Kresser%20General%20News%29%20Chris%27s%20Friday%20Favorites&amp;amp;utm_term=12-week%20clinical%20trial&amp;amp;utm_content=12-week%20clinical%20trial&amp;amp;_kx=lnJPNoBDbXDv8A7sGgOT2RynJbnjB0AOt2qh5yh0Zzn1efAmwTAJ2ZDqxahjsQ0T.my75y6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the British Journal of Nutrition, 42 participants were separated into three groups and had their diets controlled by 12 weeks. The first group was fed fish oil supplements plus white fish, the second was fed placebo plus oily fish, and the third placebo and white fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target of the paper was extracellular vesicles, (EVs) the source of an &lt;a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/csf/41/2/41_16014/_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;emerging body of literature&lt;/a&gt; on disease pathology. EVs are produced and excreted by all cells that have been examined for it. They can’t replicate, but these lipid-like particles do carry fragments of DNA and can enter other cells. For this reason they are implicated in a number of cancers, as well as&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4865996/"&gt; neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(19)30552-5/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, neurological problems, chronic inflammation, and aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVs also act as a procoagulant and senolytic, however, and have also been seen to extend the immunological memory of T cells, showing how they aren’t all bad. Their role may be similar to that of inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and Interleukin-6, which are implicated in virtually every disease known to man, but also play a role in healing the body through acute inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVs are a compelling marker of disease to measure the impact of omega-3 levels, since they are created in comparatively low numbers in most organs and tissues and present a systematic challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only the group that received the fish oil supplements which saw a reduction in the circulation of EVs in the bloodstream, while those who ate the kinds of fish recommended for improving omega-3 levels could not replicate this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the number of participants was small, both the randomized study design and the length of the study period of 3 months contribute to an overall strength of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to raise the levels of omega-3 in the body above the threshold at which the most robust effects are seen, researchers in one analysis &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522012783?via%3Dihub#s0040" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that a range of 1,750 to 2,500 milligrams was optimal and well-tolerated by the body. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WaL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA — Find yourself yawning a lot? Do you need that third or fourth cup of coffee to make it through the afternoon at work? Such signs of sleepiness may be a red flag of a serious sleep deficit that could put you in physical danger and harm your long-term health, according to a new position paper by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sleepiness is a serious health concern with wide-reaching consequences," said AASM President Dr. Eric Olson, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From drowsy driving crashes to workplace errors and long-term health risks, the effects of excessive daytime sleepiness impact individuals and society every day," Olson said in a statement about the paper, which is supported by 25 different medical organizations including the American Academy of Neurology, the National Safety Council and the American Academy of Family Physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not getting a quality night's rest of at least seven to eight hours has been linked to the development or worsening of diabetes, depression, heart and kidney disease, high blood pressure, obesity and stroke, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With one-third of U.S. adults reporting they experience excessive sleepiness, the importance of identifying interventions that recognize, assess, and treat it cannot be understated," Olson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All too often people write off signs of sleepiness, such as dozing off during a work meeting, as an insignificant issue instead of a sign of a potentially dangerous sleep deficit, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;Someone who is fully rested will not fall asleep in meetings, no matter how boring the meeting is.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;– Kristen Knutson, sleep specialist&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nodding off in boring meetings is an indication of insufficient sleep. Someone who is fully rested will not fall asleep in meetings, no matter how boring the meeting is," said sleep specialist Kristen Knutson, an associate professor of neurology and preventive medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Excessive daytime sleepiness can impair performance and be an indicator of underlying sleep disorders or other issues," Knutson said via email. "If someone is experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness regularly, they should discuss this with their physician."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A hidden danger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body does odd things when it's continuously sleepy, including overcoming those yawns and sending signals that you are, in fact, coping with the lack of sleep. However, those signals couldn't be further from the truth, said AASM board member and second author Dr. Indira Gurubhagavatula, a professor of sleep medicine at the Veteran's Administration Medical Center at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The unfortunate thing is data shows that with chronic partial sleep deprivation the ability to perceive our own level of impairment is no longer accurate — we think we're OK when we're really not," Gurubhagavatula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we do actual tests to measure how well your brain is functioning — reaction time, the ability to recall, memory tests, coordination — we find people are actually making a lot of mistakes," she said. "And it's scary because they still have this inappropriately high level of confidence that they are OK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With continued sleepiness, the brain may take mini naps, or what specialists call microsleeps, Gurubhagavatula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;We find people are actually making a lot of mistakes. And it's scary because they still have this inappropriately high level of confidence that they are OK.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;– Dr. Indira Gurubhagavatula, Penn Medicine &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your brain is actually going into brief two-second, three-second, 10-second microsleeps and then popping back out and you may not even realize this is happening," she said. "It can be very dangerous if you're driving or doing something that involves safety. So if you do feel like you might fall asleep, pay attention to that, as it's an indication it's not safe to drive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 100,000 car accidents a year are linked to drowsy driving, according to statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tests of sleepiness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you know if your sleepiness is crossing into the danger zone? You can measure it on various scales, including the &lt;a href="https://sleep.hms.harvard.edu/epworth-sleepiness-scale" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Epworth Sleepiness Scale&lt;/a&gt;, Gurubhagavatula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions on the test include how likely you'll fall asleep while sitting quietly after a lunch with no alcohol; lying down in the afternoon; sitting inactive in a public place; sitting and reading; sitting and chatting with someone; riding as a passenger in a car for an hour; sitting in traffic for a few minutes while driving; and watching television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We ask patients to rate from zero to three how likely they are to fall asleep during these eight sedentary situations," she said. "The maximum score is 24, which indicates that you're very, very sleepy. We generally consider scores above 10 to being clinically significant and worth intervention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As sleep deprivation progresses, dangerous symptoms of sleepiness can increase, Gurubhagavatula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have droopy eyelids, your body is slumping, you're having trouble staying upright, and some people even notice vertigo, the room spinning, hands shaking with severe deprivation," she said. "You can also be reckless and impulsive, like you don't care.

The vulva includes the external female genitalia, such as the labia majora and labia minora, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Necrotizing fasciitis (NF), also known as flesh-eating disease, can arise when certain bacteria enter the skin through a wound — a cut, abrasion, burn, surgical wound, or even an insect bite," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/13502/sullivan-william" target="_blank" data-url="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/13502/sullivan-william" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bill Sullivan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Indiana University, who was not involved in the case report, told Live Science in an email. "NF can occur anywhere skin or tissue is breached, including genitalia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In necrotizing fasciitis, bacteria infiltrate the fascia, which is the connective tissue surrounding muscles, nerves, fat and blood vessels. The infection rapidly causes soft tissues to die, or "necrotize," and spreads through the body very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/scientists-are-building-an-ultimate-atlas-of-the-vagina-heres-why" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/scientists-are-building-an-ultimate-atlas-of-the-vagina-heres-why"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists are building an ultimate atlas of the vagina.

"After these bacteria get into the skin, they release potent toxins that lead to rapid tissue destruction, liquefying muscle, nerves, and blood vessels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subsequent loss of blood supply to the affected body parts makes treating necrotizing fasciitis with antibiotics difficult, Sullivan explained; infected areas sometimes need to be surgically cut out of the body. Additionally, once the bacteria get into the bloodstream, they can cause &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/sepsis.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/sepsis.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sepsis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a dangerous, body-wide immune reaction, potentially leading to organ failure and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case report, the doctors described the cases of two patients who came to the emergency room with necrotising fasciitis of the vulva, as well as a third who developed the infection following a postoperative wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first patient was alerted to the infection when she found a small spot on her mons pubis — the fatty tissue over the pubic bone. She initially went to her primary care doctor, who prescribed antibiotics. However, the spot worsened over the next five days, which resulted in necrotizing fasciitis that spread to her labia majora, left hip and lower abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the ER, the infected tissue was surgically removed, or "debrided." But "despite intensive care unit (ICU) management for systemic infection," the patient died of sepsis only 28 hours after diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second patient came to the ER with a one-week history of having a lump on her labia majora, which turned out to be an infected abscess. Over the next 12 hours, the upper third of her labia majora broke down from necrotizing fasciitis. The patient ultimately needed three debridements to control the infection, after which she underwent reconstructive surgery for the lost tissue. "The wound has since healed well," her doctors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third patient suffered necrotizing fasciitis after a surgical wound got infected; she had gotten a hysterectomy as a treatment for fibroids. This patient ultimately survived after having the infected tissue surgically removed and being given broad-spectrum antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NF is very rare," and it most often arises in people with conditions that weaken the immune system, such as diabetes or cancer, Sullivan explained. An estimated &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.upmc.com/services/division-infectious-diseases/conditions/necrotizing-fasciitis" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.upmc.com/services/division-infectious-diseases/conditions/necrotizing-fasciitis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;700 to 1,200 cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are seen in the U.S. each year. About 500 cases are reported annually in the U.K., or about 0.4 to 0.53 cases per 100,000 people, the case report authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaginal necrotizing fasciitis is even more rare, as people are more likely to have skin injuries on more exposed parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaginal NF could be contracted through rough sex, a piercing, or cosmetic and surgical procedures," Sullivan said. "The mortality rate of vaginal NF is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3104625/#:~:text=If%20treatment%20is%20not%20initiated,mortality%20as%20high%20as%2050%25" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3104625/#:~:text=If%20treatment%20is%20not%20initiated,mortality%20as%20high%20as%2050%25" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;estimated to be up to 50%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case report authors urged other gynecologists to keep an eye out for any signs of an infection that could develop into necrotizing fasciitis, and they also emphasized that "time is of the essence" when treating the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaginal NF could be considered more dangerous in the sense that it might be more difficult to diagnose in time, " Sullivan said. "Gynecologists may not have NF on their diagnostic radar, and surgical interventions, which are usually required to stop NF from spreading and remove dead tissue, may be limited."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the disease quickly is key to saving patients' lives. "Delayed diagnosis can lead to delayed treatment, increasing the odds of sepsis and death," Sullivan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-YBmfVwtuCnyw95HNR6D4uY-2AFO0bzfJztkhzFdoBaZxSWzHpV1WIJR" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-YBmfVwtuCnyw95HNR6D4uY-2AFO0bzfJztkhzFdoBaZxSWzHpV1WIJR slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

After 36 months, the researchers realized something odd: that the children who had been given the popular stimulant seemed to be growing more slowly than their non-medicated counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers presumed, per their retelling to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, that this "height gap" would close in adolescence. When they followed up with them nine years after the study began, however, the medicated cohort was still 1.6 inches, on average, shorter than the kids who didn't take Ritalin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a certain level, the concern is very shallow. There's nothing wrong with being short, and if a drug can help with a myriad of other symptoms, maybe the risk is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's not the only controversy around prescribing ADHD drugs to kids. The MTA study's biggest takeaway was, troublingly, that the attention benefits of Ritalin seemed to cease after the first year, and that there were no apparent benefits to academic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even on top of that, the "height suppression" side effect was also enough to give the researchers pause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the MTA study scientists &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6168061/pdf/nihms-838603.pdf" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;published a follow-up&lt;/a&gt; looking into the height gap that tracked the original cohort until they were 25. That height gap remained, per the study, into adulthood. And the findings countered &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/09/01/344283889/more-evidence-that-adhd-drugs-dont-curb-ultimate-height" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;bold academic assertions&lt;/a&gt; from just a few years prior claiming that any height suppression from ADHD meds in children would, as the researchers initially presumed, ultimately be undone in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later, another group of scientists &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763420305923" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;reviewed 18 childhood Ritalin studies&lt;/a&gt; and found, similarly to the MTA researchers, that the drug can indeed "result in reduction in height and weight" — though their opinion was that the size of the effect is negligible when compared to the purported benefits of these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this day, researchers can't agree as to whether or not stimulants can cause height suppression in children, primarily because the mechanism behind the demonstrated effect remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the &lt;a href="https://www.healthcentral.com/article/do-stimulants-stunt-growth" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;website &lt;em&gt;Health Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, childhood psychiatrist and MTA study co-author Laurence Greenhill of the University of California, San Francisco suggested that amphetamines' well-known &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/medication-weight" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;propensity to suppress appetite&lt;/a&gt; could be behind the growth differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There could be some lack of nutrition going on that explains this," Greenhill told the website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, the kids aren't malnourished," he countered. "They're just growing a little more slowly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Ritalin or other stimulants help a child significantly, such a minor height disparity would be worthwhile. But with some of the original MTA study authors now questioning how effective these medical interventions really are, it may behoove parents to think before they put their kids on these pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on ADHD meds:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/adhd-shortage-doctor-day" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;To Fill Your Adderall Prescription Amid Shortage, Try Getting It Filled on This Particular Day of the Month&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 16:43:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFB3SDdqR1FWdDR1QUtZMmFEN215UFhGejNWa3hXT2xacUozeGFWVXRLbzFuSWhZY3NLV2tZWm16X3FWdUlULVZRanN3Z19VZ3pFLWFweDBjUk1HazFRSFZYWVV0YlFpV24xVHc</guid></item><item><title>俄勒冈州一个县报告的罕见脑部疾病导致两人死亡，另一人感染 | Two dead, another infected, as rare brain disease reported in one Oregon county - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOVG9yYTVURmQ3WXBobEkzY0xxNUJ3NEtPc1dXUjQxQlJZSW4yNno4RFhsaEwzWU9MbENma0N2RllVdXN5OWNBWUJFaU9naDFiWTFZZ3puRElUaXppQVR4M1dvd2llQm5tX1lzaUc4MnVLa1BCNGVSOUFWSlVucVFBZWZfQW80UHctTGJ4S1dDbkRMVVFMZFVscFl3MFFVLU5mUUh1RVJPSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 eWQiqu sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 cGmNxG"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iqSitv"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dlmCG"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 igdyzJ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cPkZJS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 fGzMFb sc-hez36s-16 fJelbS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 fiXggt"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 eSVQSf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 caTeJB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 blUixN"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cfrdoh"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

The results of those tests can take months to establish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt; has contacted the Hood River County Health Department for more information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creutzfeldt-Jakob causes rapidly intensifying symptoms that present movement disorders and behavioral changes, similar to Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rare and deadly disorder is caused by infectious proteins called prions, which can cause small holes in the brain that resemble sponges under a microscope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no treatment or cure. Deaths typically occur 12 months after infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 500 to 600 new cases occur in the U.S. each year. Most cases are believed to be hereditary, linked to a genetic mutation passed on from a parent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease cannot be spread from person to person except through organ or tissue transplants or other exposure to infected brain or nervous tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease is linked to eating infected beef from cows with a related disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elliott said the three Hood River cases are not believed to be related to infected cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 16:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOVG9yYTVURmQ3WXBobEkzY0xxNUJ3NEtPc1dXUjQxQlJZSW4yNno4RFhsaEwzWU9MbENma0N2RllVdXN5OWNBWUJFaU9naDFiWTFZZ3puRElUaXppQVR4M1dvd2llQm5tX1lzaUc4MnVLa1BCNGVSOUFWSlVucVFBZWZfQW80UHctTGJ4S1dDbkRMVVFMZFVscFl3MFFVLU5mUUh1RVJPSQ</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，吃这种水果会降低认知功能-玻璃年鉴 | Study Reveals Declining Cognitive Function from Eating This Fruit - Glass Almanac</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxOeHd1aENFQWNmSUpWRHlGMl8tNnVvZHN2MHZhQ1ZpNVNadzJWOWU1VnVTYnZySzRDZUU4R2xhdW5aUmI4S19OQms5WFRXWmk1Zlp5ZE9pUUN1OWNGeUhKMmZOcnpDRkdjbE9nMnVzSjF3UGgyV0wzOGlvcUhPM2hCcEl6bDF1REROcHIybGpCTVp3enZvMlE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"&gt;
			&lt;p class="" data-start="69" data-end="573"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We all know that eating a balanced diet is crucial for maintaining overall health, but new research highlights the surprising effect that certain foods can have on brain health and cognitive function. One of these foods, a tiny brain-shaped fruit, has garnered attention for its potential benefits in slowing down cognitive decline and even improving brain performance. However, another recent study suggests a different take—showing that certain fruit consumption might have an adverse effect over time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="69" data-end="573"&gt;&lt;span id="more-5705"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="575" data-end="612"&gt;The Impact of Diet on Brain Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="614" data-end="1327"&gt;Diet plays a crucial role in brain health, particularly in preventing cognitive decline, which can lead to conditions such as &lt;strong data-start="740" data-end="763"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;—a disease affecting an estimated 80,000 to a million people in countries like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/the-largest-hydrogen-deposit-ever-found-in-france-is-rewriting-the-energy-game/"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, specific diets like the &lt;strong data-start="883" data-end="905"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong data-start="914" data-end="927"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/strong&gt; have been associated with slowing cognitive decline and reducing the risk of dementia. But one food that has come to the forefront in recent studies is the &lt;strong data-start="1084" data-end="1091"&gt;nut&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly &lt;strong data-start="1106" data-end="1117"&gt;walnuts&lt;/strong&gt;. While nuts like almonds, cashews, and pistachios have long been praised for their health benefits, a study from &lt;strong data-start="1231" data-end="1252"&gt;Dutch researchers&lt;/strong&gt; has provided fresh insights into how they might impact cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="" data-start="1329" data-end="1381"&gt;A Study on Nut Consumption and Cognitive Function&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1383" data-end="1971"&gt;Published in &lt;strong data-start="1396" data-end="1418"&gt;Clinical Nutrition&lt;/strong&gt; on June 2, the study focused on the long-term effects of nut consumption, specifically on brain health. The researchers aimed to explore how eating nuts could impact the &lt;strong data-start="1589" data-end="1610"&gt;vascular function&lt;/strong&gt; in elderly individuals, particularly the functioning of the small blood vessels that feed the brain. The study involved a group of 28 healthy individuals, averaging 65 years old. The participants were split into two groups: one that consumed 60 grams of mixed nuts daily (including walnuts, pistachios, cashews, and hazelnuts) and a control group that did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1973" data-end="2599"&gt;At the end of the 16-week period, the results were compelling. The group that consumed nuts was able to recall &lt;strong data-start="2084" data-end="2102"&gt;16% more words&lt;/strong&gt; during a verbal memory test compared to those who didn’t eat nuts. In addition to improvements in memory, the study found that nuts helped &lt;strong data-start="2242" data-end="2301"&gt;maintain the flexibility and elasticity of the arteries&lt;/strong&gt;, which is beneficial for &lt;strong data-start="2327" data-end="2352"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/strong&gt;. The participants who consumed nuts also showed better circulation in the small blood vessels in the eyes, which correlated with increased blood flow in different areas of the brain, suggesting that the effects went beyond just cognitive recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="2601" data-end="2657"&gt;The Role of Antioxidants in Slowing Cognitive Decline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2659" data-end="3059"&gt;The findings on cognitive improvement are tied to the role of &lt;strong data-start="2721" data-end="2737"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/strong&gt;, which are vital in combating &lt;strong data-start="2768" data-end="2788"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/strong&gt;. Our brains are particularly susceptible to this form of stress, which can damage brain cells over time and lead to memory decline. While cognitive decline is part of the natural aging process, consuming foods rich in antioxidants, like nuts, can help slow this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="3061" data-end="3405"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3061" data-end="3076"&gt;Dani Felber&lt;/strong&gt;, a dietitian specializing in brain health, explains that oxidative stress damages brain cells, accelerating cognitive decline. “The more antioxidants you consume, the slower the cognitive decline,” she says. &lt;strong data-start="3285" data-end="3293"&gt;Nuts&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly &lt;strong data-start="3308" data-end="3319"&gt;walnuts&lt;/strong&gt;, are rich in antioxidants, making them an excellent addition to a brain-healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3407" data-end="3734"&gt;However, while the study showed improvement in memory recall, it didn’t find significant changes in areas like decision-making, stress levels, or overall quality of life. This suggests that while nuts can play a role in improving certain aspects of brain function, their impact on other cognitive domains might be more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="" data-start="3736" data-end="3778"&gt;Future Directions: More Research Needed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3780" data-end="4236"&gt;While the study provided valuable insights, it also highlighted the need for more extensive research. A larger sample size could help clarify how consuming nuts regularly affects other areas of cognitive health. In fact, previous studies, like one published in the &lt;strong data-start="4045" data-end="4079"&gt;Journal of &lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/alzheimers-researchers-pinpoint-a-new-factor-behind-the-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer&lt;/a&gt;‘s Disease&lt;/strong&gt; in 2014, found that eating a handful of nuts a day could reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s and even slow its progression in those already diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="4238" data-end="4428"&gt;As the research in this field grows, it becomes clear that small dietary changes, like adding more nuts to your daily intake, can make a big difference in maintaining brain health over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes referred to as the “Oscars of Science,” &lt;a href="https://breakthroughprize.org/"&gt;Breakthrough Prizes&lt;/a&gt; are given each year to scientists who drive innovative discoveries in the life sciences, physics, and mathematics. This year, six prizes of $3 million each were awarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two MS researchers — Stephen Hauser, MD, and Alberto Ascherio, MD, doctor of public health — will share one of the three life sciences awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This year’s Breakthrough Prize laureates have made amazing strides — including treatments for major diseases affecting millions of people worldwide — showing once again the transformative power of curiosity-driven basic science,” Priscilla Chan, MD, and Mark Zuckerberg, two of the prize’s founding sponsors, said in a Breakthrough Prize Foundation &lt;a href="https://breakthroughprize.org/News/91"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MS is an autoimmune condition wherein the immune system mistakenly attacks &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/"&gt;myelin&lt;/a&gt;, the fatty substance that surrounds and protects nerve cells. These inflammatory attacks produce areas of damage called &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-lesions/"&gt;lesions&lt;/a&gt; in the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hauser, a professor of neurology and director of the Weill Institute for Neurosciences at the University of California, San Francisco, earned the award for identifying that immune B-cells are key drivers of these attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, it was believed that MS was driven mainly by a class of immune cells called T-cells, but Hauser’s work in animal models and MS patient tissue showed that B-cells also played a central role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This discovery led to the development of B-cell-targeted therapies now widely used to treat MS. This class of therapies includes Genentech’s &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ocrevus-ocrelizumab-primary-progressive-relapsing-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Ocrevus&lt;/a&gt; (ocrelizumab), Novartis’ &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ofatumumab-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Kesimpta&lt;/a&gt; (ofatumumab), and TG Therapeutics’ &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/experimental-treatments-for-ms/ublituximab-tgtx-1101/"&gt;Briumvi&lt;/a&gt; (ublituximab), all of which are antibody-based therapies designed to deplete B-cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-treatment/"&gt;treatments&lt;/a&gt; have substantially altered the outlook for MS patients, according to the scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the past, newly diagnosed patients would be told that they may require a cane or wheelchair within 15 years,” Hauser said in a &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/04/429746/stephen-hauser-wins-breakthrough-prize-role-redefining-ms"&gt;university news article&lt;/a&gt;. “Today, our data indicate that many new patients can expect lives free from disability.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientist acknowledged that many others contributed to the discoveries that led to B-cell-depleting therapies for MS, particularly the patients who participated in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Without them, this breakthrough would not have been possible,” Hauser said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hauser now continues with research to help improve outcomes for people with MS, including work to discover genes linked to the disease. He hopes that a recently discovered genetic region could lead to new therapeutic approaches for people with progressive forms of MS who don’t respond as well to B-cell therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have never been more optimistic for the future: what’s in store for our patients today, as well as those developing MS in the future, who may soon be diagnosed — and treated — even before they experience their first &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt;,” Hauser said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Discoveries about the Epstein-Barr virus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his part, Ascherio, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, was involved in the historic discovery that a past infection with the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/epstein-barr-virus-and-ms/"&gt;Epstein-Barr virus&lt;/a&gt; (EBV) is a leading &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;cause of MS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ascherio’s career has been inspired by a drive to identify the root cause of diseases to prevent them from happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You realize that if you don’t prevent diseases and you don’t address the causes of disease, then people will keep getting sick,” Ascherio said in a &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/alberto-ascherio-receives-breakthrough-prize-for-groundbreaking-research-on-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Harvard news article&lt;/a&gt;. “So, I thought, can we go more to the root — to find the cause of the disease and intervene there?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most adults have been infected with EBV, even if they aren’t aware of it. After the initial infection, the virus is latent within the body for the rest of a person’s life. Scientists had believed for many decades that MS could be caused by a viral infection such as EBV, but there hadn’t been sufficient data to establish that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a landmark study involving more than 10 million members of the U.S. military, Ascherio and colleagues found that EBV infection &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2022/01/13/epstein-barr-virus-may-be-leading-cause-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;raised the risk of developing MS later in life by 32 times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s virtually a consensus now that EBV is the leading cause of MS,” Ascherio said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That has led to the work on developing therapies that target EBV as a way to treat MS. Efforts are also underway to develop vaccines for preventing EBV infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Ascherio and colleagues are continuing to investigate the mechanistic link between the common virus and MS as a way to better understand which infected people will ultimately develop the neurodegenerative disease. They’re also trying to understand whether viral infections play a role in other neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Multiple Sclerosis News Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 16:12:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxQNHRJZlZISXcwQ1NiZ3NrZk40UGVtQ1F5eFJSLXlJYUNvZy00STg5bEZzb19SRTdCNllqTUtGQ0F2RThHVjZQWUtwQXg4ZXNjVlA3eFVsbkc4YVQ5NUhJNFYtREg5Zl9Nb3VrbVJVUFpJYkxuWUpqSHZnSGNHNmpKcDY4WVdidmYwYmlaZnBDRXM1X3h4X185TXZjalZ6MnJ4OVdHYUNOWW5vYS0wXzl3Snk0UmJ5c1o4V3ItS3M5N09NWWd6</guid></item><item><title>常见食用油中的脂肪与侵袭性乳腺癌有关-但这就是你不应该恐慌的原因-对话 | Fat in common cooking oils is linked to aggressive breast cancer - but here’s why you shouldn’t panic - The Conversation</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizAFBVV95cUxNaHFVNGhobTdFVW5RUE51ZVZpNzkzUmNoT3RvczZMSm9Uelcta3Eyc21nY29hVWtITFQwMFExY1lTVXdET3FxQWprN21Rbkd5VXJ5Q2hLYS0xOWFzaUF2bEd3ZXMyYTBSN2NaVnVVOHpfdGxnYWljSDdkakdPMElESEEybzA0V1FaN1ZCcU5xOWhGcWgyVGNjSEliTTU3bUhaajFkdE9VQkgyQTBpWkx6Zk9wTEZnR1BXeFB0S21Vem54aTVJQll3Z1A3NVg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body " itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There’s now lots of evidence which &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-a-daily-glass-of-milk-really-could-reduce-bowel-cancer-risk-an-oncologist-explains-247301"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-eating-yoghurt-regularly-could-lower-your-risk-of-bowel-cancer-251942"&gt;our&lt;/a&gt; own &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-cut-your-risk-of-cancer-by-an-oncology-consultant-245858"&gt;diets&lt;/a&gt; and the foods we eat can influence the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/king-charles-is-changing-his-diet-to-keep-his-cancer-at-bay-heres-what-the-evidence-says-245582"&gt;outcome&lt;/a&gt; if we are unlucky enough to suffer from cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists are especially interested in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24861-8"&gt;how this happens&lt;/a&gt;, in particular the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind these associations. This would better inform &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24861-8"&gt;nutritional recommendations&lt;/a&gt; and help us understand how cancer forms so we can prevent it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm9805"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; has identified a molecular link between linoleic acid, a common fat contained in cooking oils, and aggressive breast cancer, renewing the discussion about dietary choices and cancer risk. The findings, while significant, require careful interpretation to avoid unnecessary alarm and give useful guidance to the public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Common fatty acid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleic_acid"&gt;Linoleic acid&lt;/a&gt; is an omega-6 fatty acid which is found in abundant quantities in soybean, sunflower and corn oils. Researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York showed it can directly activate a growth pathway in triple-negative breast cancer cells – a type of breast cancer especially known for its &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32125284/"&gt;aggressiveness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31927455/"&gt;limited treatment options&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Triple negative breast cancer makes up about 15% of all breast cancer cases, but because breast cancer is so common, this affects a lot of people. The researchers found that linoleic acid binds to a protein called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FABP5"&gt;FABP5&lt;/a&gt; (fatty acid-binding protein 5), which is at high levels in these cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This binding triggers the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-019-0199-y"&gt;mTORC1 pathway&lt;/a&gt; – a critical regulator of cell growth and metabolism – fuelling tumour progression in preclinical research, including animal studies. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37596643/"&gt;My current research&lt;/a&gt; focuses on this pathway in a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202310.1387/v2"&gt;normal and cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm9805"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, mice fed a high linoleic-acid diet developed larger tumours, suggesting dietary intake may exacerbate this cancer’s growth. There was a link to people too: elevated FABP5 and linoleic acid levels were detected in blood samples from triple-negative breast cancer patients, strengthening the biological plausibility of this link. Dr John Blenis, the senior author of the paper, said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery helps clarify the relationship between dietary fats and cancer, and sheds light on how to define which patients might benefit the most from specific nutritional recommendations in a personalised manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that the implications extend beyond triple negative breast cancer to other tumours such as prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linoleic acid is an &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37513547/"&gt;essential fatty acid&lt;/a&gt; so it must be obtained from food. It plays a role in skin health, cell membrane structure and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31785494/"&gt;inflammation regulation&lt;/a&gt;. However, modern diets, which are rich in processed foods, ultraprocesed foods and seed oils, often provide excessive omega-6 fats, including linoleic acid, while lacking omega-3s, which are found in fish, flaxseeds and walnuts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This imbalance could promote &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00658-5"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, which is a well known &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6831096/"&gt;contributor to cancer&lt;/a&gt; and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study therefore suggests that linoleic acid may directly drive cancer growth in specific contexts. This challenges earlier observational studies that found no clear association between dietary linoleic acid and overall breast cancer risk. For example, a 2023 meta-analysis of 14 studies in over 350,000 women concluded that linoleic acid intake had &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10271020/"&gt;no significant effect&lt;/a&gt; on breast cancer risk in the general population. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discrepancy highlights the importance of researchers looking specifically at cancer subtypes and also individual factors, such as FABP5 levels in cancers themselves. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10558966/"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; showed that linoleic acid was protective against breast cancer, which demonstrates why it’s important to consider everything in context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Don’t panic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media headlines can often oversimplify complex research. While this new study highlights a plausible mechanism linking linoleic acid to cancer growth, it does not prove that cooking oils cause breast cancer – far from it. Other factors, such as genetics, overall diet and environmental exposures, play significant roles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings do not warrant blanket avoidance of seed oils but suggest moderation and selectivity, especially for high-risk individuals. Many oils such as olive oil contain less linoleic acid and higher monounsaturated or saturated fats, which are more stable at high heat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do also consider &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00879-6"&gt;eating more fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; as part of a healthy, balanced diet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03570-5"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; that  comprehensively analysed eating habits over 30 years showed that diets that are rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and low-fat dairy products were linked to healthy ageing. In that study, the Harvard team followed more than 100,000 people between 1986 and 2016. Fewer than 10% of respondents achieved healthy ageing, defined by a lack of 11 major chronic diseases and no impairment in cognitive, physical or mental function by the age of 70. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organisations like the World Cancer Research Fund emphasise that moderate use of vegetable oils is safe and that &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/action-on-obesity"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, not specific fats, is the primary dietary driver of cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study, then, underscores the importance of contextualising dietary fats in cancer research. While linoleic acid’s role in triple-negative breast cancer is a critical discovery, it’s one piece of a vast puzzle. A balanced, wholefood diet remains an important cornerstone of cancer prevention, and a strategy everyone can adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mimicking the activity of the molecule, miR-216a-3p, eased inflammation and scarring in a rat model of the disease. Its therapeutic effects seem to lie in its ability to inhibit the pro-inflammatory STAT1/JAK signaling pathway, preventing the activation of the immune B-cells that have been implicated in the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These results collectively suggest a potentially significant role for miR-216a-3p in the [development] of autoimmune diseases, warranting further investigation,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X25003614?viaihub"&gt;&lt;span&gt;miR-216a-3p alleviates primary Sjögren’s syndrome by regulating the STAT1/JAK signaling pathway&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/a&gt;” was published in &lt;em&gt;Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sjögren’s disease is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s healthy moisture-producing glands, leading to &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/symptoms-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;Sjögren’s symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as dry eyes and mouth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;MicroRNAs seen driving diseases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some cases of Sjögren’s are associated with other underlying conditions — this is known as secondary Sjögren’s — the &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/causes-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;cause of primary Sjögren’s&lt;/a&gt;, in which the condition arises in the absence of other diseases, is not understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accumulating data suggest that microRNAs (miRNAs), small strands of genetic material capable of influencing gene activity, play a role in driving autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren’s. Indeed, &lt;a href="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2756047"&gt;altered miRNA profiles&lt;/a&gt; have been observed in the tears of people with primary Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several miRNAs are known to influence genes involved in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. This pathway has been linked to inflammation and activation of antibody-producing immune cells, namely B-cells, that are believed to contribute to Sjögren’s disease processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to further identify the miRNAs that might be involved in Sjögren’s, and to establish their influence on JAK/STAT signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They first looked at gene activity data sets from people with and without Sjögren’s, finding gene activity changes particularly associated with inflammatory responses. The most substantially altered one was the JAK/STAT gene &lt;em&gt;STAT1,&lt;/em&gt; which had elevated activity in Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists then identified a number of miRNAs that might work upstream of &lt;em&gt;STAT1&lt;/em&gt; to regulate its activity, with miR-216a-3p being the one predicted to have the greatest effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;miR-216a-3p activity was lower in glandular tissues of people with primary Sjögren’s relative to people without it, while &lt;em&gt;STAT1&lt;/em&gt; activity was higher. Blood and salivary gland tissue analyses showed signs of elevated inflammation in people with primary Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further explore the role of miR-216a-3p, the scientists treated a rat model of Sjögren’s with compounds to either mimic or inhibit miR-216a-3p.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment with the miR-216a-3p mimic led to significant reductions in inflammation and scarring within the salivary glands and helped to increase saliva flow rate. Inflammation and scarring were increased, while salivary flow rate was decreased, with the miR-216a-3p inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in humans, miR-216a-3p activity was reduced and &lt;em&gt;STAT1&lt;/em&gt; activity was increased in salivary gland tissue from the rat model. When the rats were treated with the miR-216a-3p mimic, &lt;em&gt;STAT1&lt;/em&gt; activity went down, as did the levels of several pro-inflammatory proteins in the blood. Again, the reverse was true with the miR-216a-3p inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experiments showed that the miR-216a-3p mimic appeared to inhibit the activation of JAK/STAT signaling to prevent the overactivation of B-cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This finding not only reveals the potential role of miR-216a-3p in regulating B cell function but also provides a new therapeutic target for [primary Sjögren’s],” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists said future research will focus more on how miR-216a-3p influences B-cell signaling pathways, and will further evaluate its therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This will not only help deepen our understanding of the [development of primary Sjögren’s] but may also offer new therapeutic insights for other autoimmune diseases,” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Sjogren's Syndrome News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 15:47:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNeVBNUy1qbWloOVdOYi1iOVNmNWxZVnZHZkJHWjIwd3VRM0VWY2l4eUl3dkRHZG1OZ0l1VTNMSmlWcG9ycDZRZVBNdlNvWEVld1dNOERwUUNRc0o3ZmEyMUFVcjVBUXJiRnl5WlFhbmRmNDVnNXk2cU9IVUJTQUl1RTE2X1BocE5y</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，他们可能发现了自闭症的一个令人震惊的原因--《每日邮报》 | Scientists say they may have discovered a shocking cause of autism - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxQdEt5NFloNHlIWjRsVDdGZF9USlVhX1I2RzhxQmpZOGMyMGtybGUtTXlGMEhDSWZRcnNwb0NMM2hndVQyakNKQTRGUmZhVGdYWXZ5N2VUY2t5aTlaaVhiQ1VKdjlybm1GNjJ2MFYzZnJrVWhQNzAteVVKMVR4T0swWG1UaVhHbjVXcjBmZE03c1gyc0lZVDh0dnNFX19veU1HX3ZIbA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Autism might begin in the gut — not the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new study has found autistic children have [distinctly] different bacteria in their stomachs compared to kids without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers say these changes to the microbiome - a network of bacteria that regulate digestion and other processes - lead to changes in parts of the brain associated with behavior and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diet and other environmental exposures in the womb have been linked to harmful microbiome changes in babies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team noted autistic children were also more likely to have had mothers who used antibiotics in pregnancy, suggesting use of the medications could have increased the risk of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They compared stool samples and brain scans of children aged eight to 17 with autism compared to typically developing children in the same age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found autistic children and teens had lower levels of certain metabolites - small molecules produced during digestion - than neurotypical children, causing their guts to produce less of the mood-regulating hormone serotonin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers believe these &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13567627/gut-bacteria-stress-mental-health.html"&gt;changes in the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; may lead to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14167135/Psychologist-reveals-common-traits-autistic.html"&gt;symptoms of autism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; like communication difficulties and behavioral issues. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This so-called 'gut-brain' connection theory has been suggested for decades as a potential autism cause but was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-7025313/Can-boosting-good-gut-bacteria-really-help-autism.html"&gt;thought to have been debunked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Changes to the gut microbiome may help explain a rise in autism cases, acccording to a new study (stock images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the new study injects life back into that theory by looking at stool samples and brain scans at the same time and homing in one particular sets of metabolites. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team, from the University of Southern California, said the findings could lead to treatments targeting the gut 'while also hopefully alleviating some of the symptoms that are the most uncomfortable for [autistic children],' like bloating and constipation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they cautioned more large-scale, definitive research is still needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lisa Aziz-Zadeh, lead study author and professor at the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-5fe889e0-193d-11f0-948e-9b5860b87d38"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, said: 'We demonstrated that gut metabolites impact the brain, and the brain, in turn, affects behavior. Essentially, the brain acts as the intermediary between gut health and autism-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Previous studies highlighted differences in gut microbiomes and brain structures in autism, but our research connects the dots.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as one in 36 children in the US have autism, adding up to just under 2million. In the early 2000s, that number was closer to one in 142, a four-fold rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are working to uncover the causes of the increase, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14069191/autism-air-quality-pollution-Haitham-Amal-nitric-oxide.html"&gt;raising concerns over environmental factors&lt;/a&gt; like microplastics and pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They have also noted diagnostic changes have made it easier for doctors to spot the condition, especially in once overlooked groups like girls and adults. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published Monday in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58459-1#Sec9"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, compared 43 children with autism to 41 neurotypical children from healthcare clinics in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-170e4800-192d-11f0-948e-9b5860b87d38"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants were between eight and 17 years old, and the average age was 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About half of the autistic participants took medications like antidepressants, antipsychotics and stimulants for their behaviors. None of the neurotypical children took prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers asked all of the children to stay away from antibiotics for a month and probiotics for two weeks, as both medications can alter the gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study took place over the course of two days. On the first day, researchers gave the children behavioral assessments. On the second day, participants brought in stool samples and underwent MRI scans of their brains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Parents were also asked to report which diet their children most closely followed: Standard American (high consumption of processed foods, red meat, poultry, eggs and dairy), Modified American (high consumption of whole grains, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, vegetables, fruits and some processed foods), Mediterranean, Paleo, vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free, low FODMAP or other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers honed in on metabolites in participants' stool that followed the 'tryptophan pathway.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typtophan is an amino acid found in turkey, salmon, eggs, and seeds that breaks down into the metabolite serotonin, which is crucial for brain functions like emotional processing, social interaction and learning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers noted because more than 90 percent of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut, changes in gut health could influence serotonin levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nerve cells in the gut then send signals to the brain, a phenomenon known as the gut-brain axis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Children in the study with autism were more likely to have mothers who used antibiotics during pregnancy, which could have caused gut microbiome disturbances (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found children with autism had lower levels of typtophan metabolites than neurotypical children, resulting in lower serotonin levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This lead to higher rates of &lt;span&gt;gastrointestinal issues like bloating and constipation and an increased prevalence of changes in areas of the brain responsible for social behaviors, leading to 'ASD symptomology.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aziz-Zadeh said: 'We know that children with autism have brain differences — certain parts of their brain are either less active or more active compared to typically developing children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We also know they often experience gastrointestinal issues, such as constipation, stomach pain and other digestive problems. Additionally, autism is associated with various symptoms, including repetitive behaviors and social difficulties.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with diet, lower typtophan metabolites may also be caused by antibiotics disturbing the gut microbiome. The team found children with autism had a higher likelihood of their mothers using antibiotics during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Prenatal maternal antibiotic exposure has been shown to affect the maternal microbiome, which plays an important role in the fetal brain’s exposure to altered maternal microbial metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This prenatal mechanism has been hypothesized to play a role in the etiology of ASD.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers cautioned 'out study is unable to demonstrate causality,' meaning it can't directly show metabolite levels cause autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Autism advocacy groups have also said the causes of autism are not fully understood and many experts suggest there isn't one specific cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the study, including not looking at children under eight years old and having more boys than girls.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the new study injects life back into that theory by looking at stool samples and brain scans at the same time and homing in one particular sets of metabolites. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team, from the University of Southern California, said the findings could lead to treatments targeting the gut 'while also hopefully alleviating some of the symptoms that are the most uncomfortable for [autistic children],' like bloating and constipation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they cautioned more large-scale, definitive research is still needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lisa Aziz-Zadeh, lead study author and professor at the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-5fe889e0-193d-11f0-948e-9b5860b87d38"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, said: 'We demonstrated that gut metabolites impact the brain, and the brain, in turn, affects behavior. Essentially, the brain acts as the intermediary between gut health and autism-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Previous studies highlighted differences in gut microbiomes and brain structures in autism, but our research connects the dots.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as one in 36 children in the US have autism, adding up to just under 2million. In the early 2000s, that number was closer to one in 142, a four-fold rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are working to uncover the causes of the increase, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14069191/autism-air-quality-pollution-Haitham-Amal-nitric-oxide.html"&gt;raising concerns over environmental factors&lt;/a&gt; like microplastics and pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They have also noted diagnostic changes have made it easier for doctors to spot the condition, especially in once overlooked groups like girls and adults. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published Monday in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58459-1#Sec9"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, compared 43 children with autism to 41 neurotypical children from healthcare clinics in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-170e4800-192d-11f0-948e-9b5860b87d38"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants were between eight and 17 years old, and the average age was 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About half of the autistic participants took medications like antidepressants, antipsychotics and stimulants for their behaviors. None of the neurotypical children took prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers asked all of the children to stay away from antibiotics for a month and probiotics for two weeks, as both medications can alter the gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study took place over the course of two days. On the first day, researchers gave the children behavioral assessments. On the second day, participants brought in stool samples and underwent MRI scans of their brains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Parents were also asked to report which diet their children most closely followed: Standard American (high consumption of processed foods, red meat, poultry, eggs and dairy), Modified American (high consumption of whole grains, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, vegetables, fruits and some processed foods), Mediterranean, Paleo, vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free, low FODMAP or other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers honed in on metabolites in participants' stool that followed the 'tryptophan pathway.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typtophan is an amino acid found in turkey, salmon, eggs, and seeds that breaks down into the metabolite serotonin, which is crucial for brain functions like emotional processing, social interaction and learning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers noted because more than 90 percent of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut, changes in gut health could influence serotonin levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nerve cells in the gut then send signals to the brain, a phenomenon known as the gut-brain axis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Children in the study with autism were more likely to have mothers who used antibiotics during pregnancy, which could have caused gut microbiome disturbances (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found children with autism had lower levels of typtophan metabolites than neurotypical children, resulting in lower serotonin levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This lead to higher rates of &lt;span&gt;gastrointestinal issues like bloating and constipation and an increased prevalence of changes in areas of the brain responsible for social behaviors, leading to 'ASD symptomology.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aziz-Zadeh said: 'We know that children with autism have brain differences — certain parts of their brain are either less active or more active compared to typically developing children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We also know they often experience gastrointestinal issues, such as constipation, stomach pain and other digestive problems. Additionally, autism is associated with various symptoms, including repetitive behaviors and social difficulties.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with diet, lower typtophan metabolites may also be caused by antibiotics disturbing the gut microbiome. The team found children with autism had a higher likelihood of their mothers using antibiotics during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Prenatal maternal antibiotic exposure has been shown to affect the maternal microbiome, which plays an important role in the fetal brain’s exposure to altered maternal microbial metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This prenatal mechanism has been hypothesized to play a role in the etiology of ASD.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers cautioned 'out study is unable to demonstrate causality,' meaning it can't directly show metabolite levels cause autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Autism advocacy groups have also said the causes of autism are not fully understood and many experts suggest there isn't one specific cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the study, including not looking at children under eight years old and having more boys than girls.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Frequently visiting the emergency room at your local hospital due to smoking weed may increase your risk for developing dementia by 72 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the latest study, the researchers studied over six million people aged 45 to 105 years old from Ontario, Canada, who had no history of dementia between January 2008 and December 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of this, they identified 16,275 people who had developed dementia and had a history of cannabis use that required acute care - defined as a visit to the emergency department (ED) or hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These people were then compared to people in three groups: individuals with an all-cause acute care visit; the general population and individuals with acute care due to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed that five percent of people aged 45 years or older who had received treatment for cannabis in acute care were diagnosed with dementia within five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand, only 1.3 percent of the general population (non smokers who do not require acute care) and 3.6 percent of individuals receiving care for another reason developed dementia in a five year span. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, 19 percent of people in the same group who had received cannabis-related care had developed dementia within 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Merely 5.5 percent of the general population and 14.8 people receiving care for another reason developed dementia in a decade's time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also found that the risk of dementia in individuals with acute care for cannabis was 31 percent lower over the next five years than individuals who required acute care for alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

and Lund University in Sweden found that by giving heart attack patients two drugs together – statins and ezetimibe, a cholesterol-lowering drug – their risk of another heart attack, stroke or death was reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This study shows that we could save lives and reduce further heart attacks by giving patients a combination of two low-cost drugs,” said Prof Kausik Ray, of Imperial’s School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But at the moment patients across the world aren’t receiving these drugs together. That is causing unnecessary and avoidable heart attacks and deaths – and also places unnecessary costs on healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Our study shows the way forward. Care pathways must now change for patients after this type of heart event.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers analysed patient data to measure the potential impact of the dual combination of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;They compared patients who received statins and ezetimibe within 12 weeks of a heart attack, those who were given statins with ezetimibe added between 13 weeks and 16 months, and others who got just statins with no ezetimibe at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Data from 36,000 Swedish patients who had a heart attack between 2015 and 2022 was analysed, and advanced statistical models were used to emulate a clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Those who received statins and ezetimibe within 12 weeks of a heart attack and were able to lower cholesterol to the target level early had a better prognosis and less risk of new cardiovascular events and death than those who received the add-on treatment later, or not at all, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Our findings suggest that a simple change in treatment guidelines could have a huge impact on patients,” said Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Ezetimibe is already widely available and prescribed for relatively low cost. This add-on therapy could be rolled out for around £350 a year per patient, which is a huge cost saving compared to the lasting impacts of treating heart attacks and the impact they have on patients’ lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Margret Leosdottir, an associate professor at Lund University and a senior cardiology consultant at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö, Sweden, said she hoped the findings would lead to changes in global guidelines, in order to “prevent unnecessary suffering and save lives”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Leosdottir said the combination therapy was currently not typically offered to heart attack patients globally because a “precautionary principle” was applied to avoid side-effects and overmedication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“However, there are positive effects from applying both medicines as soon after the infarction [heart attack] as possible. Not doing this entails an increased risk. In addition, the drug we have examined in the study causes few side-effects and is readily available and inexpensive in many countries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 15:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wFBVV95cUxOUDJEWmRJSXk0Ymo2SThQeVZlMlpDZ1pQYjlOU29IbUJNNDlmWVN4ekpPMzd0WHJuZDRfMGtKYVhXQzNJTzh5bDhDcVBmOTNVZ3NYVGNidS16dVMxV0pob0lJZGx6MUx2UlJibUF2TjFsWldiX01NQ0ZrRE9tU2NLb21iYVlIQkswdW1MdGpJYnpsTjBfMDNSSV84ejlMNjdZMS1tay1hemdrc3BlRmZkTmJDeTMwN3p2Y3BINTJJVC1CSWUzdXk1dVQ1Y2JzVGFZWW93</guid></item><item><title>家庭建议：如果我在怀孕期间没有听从我嫂子的建议，一切都会有所不同。-石板 | Family advice: If I hadn't listened to my sister-in-law's advice during my pregnancy, everything could've been different. - Slate</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxNeThIdGR0Z0I4QTVCTnR3OUU5eXJMQXUtMWhDWGdDc0ZpY05GTnVucExVTUNGZ29rVmxVYjJRQmVlRkFDZ0M0Y1hQTC1UZ00xQWNRNGxnSXVaalQ2OUhQWGVPQ0pFb3M1eEFjM2w4SVVsRWlMTnVacFl1b1FVbFRzcjN0ekNUZU1heHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9h6bemr001h3b73n0fnjrwd@published"&gt;My husband and I live in the same area as my husband’s sister. When I became pregnant, my sister-in-law (who is a nurse) asked who I had chosen as my doctor. I shared the name, and she simply replied, “Oh.” That worried my husband, who asked why she responded like that. She was a bit evasive and just said she’d “heard some things” from friends who had worked with/for that office and didn’t think overall she was the greatest provider. I ended up switching to an office she recommended.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9h76n23004o3b73nx5thgrh@published"&gt;To make a long, emotional story short, throughout the pregnancy there were small warning signs that I asked about that my doctor always confidently explained away. I ended up delivering my baby at 27 weeks due to an emergent medical condition; all the concerns I had voiced throughout the pregnancy were verified as warning signs of the conditions that my baby and I ended up having. My baby spent four months in the NICU after birth. While it probably couldn’t have been avoided entirely, our medical team (which ended up including the doctor I had originally chosen) was fairly confident that some simple interventions and more aggressive monitoring could’ve helped manage and push off the onset of the issue until later in my pregnancy, allowing my baby more time before birth.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="153" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9h6bijy001o3b73amcxan45@published"&gt;While I don’t blame my SIL for how things went in my pregnancy, I do find myself with some complicated feelings toward her because, without her unsolicited input, I wouldn’t have been with that doctor. I hate that I listened to her and didn’t stick with the doctor I had decided on after research. I beat myself up about the possibilities. Maybe a different doctor would’ve listened to my questions more, maybe a different one would’ve been concerned by the early indicators and taken steps, and maybe my child wouldn’t have the long-lasting health effects she now has. I went to therapy for a year and it helped a lot. My therapist reinforced that having a negative connection in my head between my SIL and my pregnancy makes sense given the situation. She said I am handling it and working through it well and appropriately, but it will take a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="192" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9h6blyz001v3b73k6vrl4jv@published"&gt;Well, my SIL is now pregnant and has decided that I am a great person to bring her every pregnancy-related question to, as well as asking me to accompany her to appointments that her husband can’t attend. I can’t do it. I certainly don’t wish her or her baby anything but an easy pregnancy and happy, healthy outcome, but I have no desire to be involved in her pregnancy. I don’t want to hold her hand while she gets ultrasounds done. I don’t want to discuss her pregnancy symptoms and whether I had them or not, I don’t want to help her plan her birth experience. However, my (polite!) attempts to not be more involved are being taken very personally. She’s commenting on it to me and our other family members, who are then calling, texting, and emailing me, emphasizing how she really needs support right now and I’m in an ideal place to provide it. My mother-in-law specifically called sobbing about how much it hurts her that she can’t be there in person for her daughter and how much it would mean to her to know I was there alongside her.&lt;/p&gt;

My husband knows about it, but I will not tell the rest of his family, and certainly not his sister. How do I get out of this and stop the hounding/guilting?&lt;/p&gt;

I hope you are proud of yourself for accessing the help you need.&lt;br&gt;I agree that it doesn’t do anyone any good for you to go into the specifics of your struggle not to associate your sister-in-law with your birth experience. However, the family is aware of your baby’s premature birth and, presumably, at least some of the ongoing health complications. So you need to be firmer and clearer about that and own the fact that you are still dealing with your own trauma. Thus, you can’t help your SIL the way she wants. Your script might go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9h6bujr002u3b7369sjcvp9@published"&gt;“I am so happy for [SIL] and can’t wait to meet her baby. That said, I am still processing the physical and emotional trauma that resulted from [my baby’s] birth, even after all this time. I don’t talk about it a lot, but it is still something that weighs on me heavily. I spent a year seeing a therapist, and although things have gotten better, I still feel vulnerable about it all. So while I, again, am happy for [SIL], it is impossible for me to show up for her the way she wants me to. This isn’t something I want to talk about any further, so I’m asking that you trust me that this decision is what is best for me and my health, my baby, and even my sister-in-law.”&lt;/p&gt;

And if anyone tries to either give you a hard time or grill you for grizzly details, immediately end the conversation. It’s understandable that your sister wants a support net, but I hope she respects that you cannot be the one to provide it. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

But assuming you have done that, researchers from a team led by Noémie te Rietmolen from the Aix-Marseille University in France have found a way that helped participants pick out the conversation from the noise a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team was building on previous work, which showed how movement and keeping a beat can help with auditory processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Listening to speech activates cortical regions of the sensorimotor system," the team explains in their paper. "Their role in linguistic processing has been highly investigated, but their putative role in the analysis of the temporal dynamics of the speech signal has been mostly overlooked. However, studies on speech perception in adverse listening conditions – such as a noisy or multi-talker environment – show that tracking the temporal modulations of the speech signal of a speaker of interest facilitates speech comprehension."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, the team got French-speaking participants to listen to 80 long sentences over background noise. The aim for the participants was then to identify which word (from a provided list) was spoken out loud, just after &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/can-t-afford-a-hearing-aid-your-airpods-might-do-just-fine-instead-study-finds-66223" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;hearing &lt;/a&gt;the sentence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;"[P]articipants were presented a white fixation cross (0.5 s) indicating the start of the trial, after which they heard an audible prime beat. They were instructed to, as quickly as possible, synchronize to the auditory beat by pressing the spacebar of the keyboard with their index finger. Periodic prime beats were presented for 5 s at either the phrasal (~1.1 Hz, s.d. = 0.15), lexical (~1.8 Hz, s.d. = 0.23) or syllabic (~5.0 Hz, s.d. = 0.33) rate of the upcoming sentence," the team explains, adding that there was a control group who were not asked to tap along with a beat at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We asked participants to tap prior to (and not during) the sentence in order to avoid complications inherent to performing a dual task (i.e. tapping while attempting to understand a sentence embedded in noise)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, the team found that tapping out a &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/do-seals-feel-the-beat-faster-rhythmic-sequences-pique-their-interest-65931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;rhythm&lt;/a&gt; did have a positive effect on processing, with participants more likely to get the correct answer whilst doing so. But it has to be done at the right rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;"Here we show that the beneficial effect of a generic periodic prime on speech comprehension is strongest at a frequency of approximately 1.5−2 Hz," the team explains in their study. "This observed rate-selectivity at the lexical rate rules out the possibility that the facilitation is driven by nonspecific arousal or motor preparation effects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the team cannot rule out that this is a French-specific phenomenon, the team points out that the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/languages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt; would be more suitable to syllable-level segmentation, making it unlikely that it is caused by the rhythmic structure of the language itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results show that speech-in-noise comprehension benefits specifically from tapping at the lexical-level time scale. This cannot be easily interpreted as being related to the rhythmic prosodic structure of the French language and is more easily explained by a universal segmentation strategy," the team writes in their discussion. "This suggests that our effect is not language-dependent and should generalize across languages. Instead, this preferred tapping rate is in line with what is observed in music research. That is, ~1.5−2 Hz closely approximates the optimal rate for motor rhythmic precision, but acutely also of auditory temporal attention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More study will be needed to confirm this effect, and whether it is truly applicable across other languages. On top of this, we don't know whether the trick would be of benefit to people with hearing or processing issues. But if you struggle to hear conversations, tapping a rhythm at 1.5-2 Hz (or 1.5-2 times per second) could be worth a shot in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2025.0354" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Society B&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 15:16:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNT2x2bFM1OUZrUXp1VFdGS2UzNUpSVGp3cERIbHFXU1FmMk1qN2Z6dmhWcTh6d1p2X1JGMG5GXzdZOFpSeGJPXzRmTnBWcDFHQkhOcGhSc0Q4SzlfdEtaUGIwWWItS2RIZlRPOFRRVkxvOVVlQ0lkcG1TT2dZZEpGVURlbEJNeF9LLWxXZDBsWm9QaFlDNFI0RkJKSnVkM2ZjdVZCbmRHSUJfaXhjaEsxMA</guid></item><item><title>这么多年轻人被诊断患有晚期结肠癌的可耻原因- dailymail.co.uk | Shameful reason so many young people being diagnosed with late-stage colon cancer - dailymail.co.uk</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A record number of young people are being diagnosed &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14601953/Bowel-cancer-sign-problem-millions-suffer.html"&gt;with late-stage colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;

Registry - which has been collecting information on all cancer cases diagnosed and treated in Puerto Rico since 1950 - they discovered that during these events, rates of CRC diagnoses dropped during and shortly afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, late-stage diagnoses eventually exceeded expectations, suggesting that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14596467/weight-loss-mom-stage-3-colon-cancer-age-38.html"&gt;limited access to cancer screening&lt;/a&gt; services due to these disasters likely hindered timely CRC diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A record number of young people are being diagnosed with late-stage colon cancer due to disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, new findings suggest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A previous study by the American Cancer Society found that late stage diagnoses across the board were 7 percent more likely in 2020 and that communities of color were particularly hard hit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They noted that, with nearly two million new cancer diagnoses each year, these diagnostic delays could result in tens of thousands of additional deaths and millions of dollars in added health care costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If colon cancer is detected and treated in its early stages, the five-year survival rate is approximately 90 percent, while it is around 60 percent if it is diagnosed in its advanced stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cost of treatment also dramatically increases, with early-stage colon cancer costing around $40,000 to treat, while advanced stages can exceed $300,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer diagnoses are on the rise among younger adults aged 15 to 34 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a separate study also published today investigating this trend, Dr Arvind Trindade from Rutgers University School of Medicine calls it 'worrisome'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He led a recent body of research investigating the rise of colon cancer among younger people and his hope is that his findings will help doctors to form a more effective approach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He concluded: 'Heightened awareness of this trend is necessary when evaluating younger patients with possible corresponding symptoms.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the University of Puerto Rico study investigating disasters and their knock-on effects, the researchers noted that during these events medical services may be delayed or inaccessible due to damaged infrastructure, overburdened health care facilities, or shortages of medical staff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to late diagnoses, interruptions in treatment, and an overall worsening of survival and other health outcomes for patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found that from 2012–2021, a total of 18,537 residents received a first-time diagnosis of CRC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the month the hurricanes struck, 161.4 CRC cases would have been expected in the absence of any interruption, but instead, only 82 cases were diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a slight upward trend, there was a second decline following the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In April 2020, the observed number of CRC cases was 50, but the expected number of cases without interruptions would have been 162.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the end of the study, the estimated numbers of patients with early-stage CRC and those aged 50–75 years (the recommended screening age range) did not reach expected numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, numbers of patients with late-stage CRC and those outside the recommended screening age range exceeded expected numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the findings, co–lead author Tonatiuh Suárez-Ramos, MS said: 'These findings suggest that limited health care access during these events may have delayed cancer detection and may have worsened health outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This issue is especially critical in Puerto Rico, since the health care system already faces important challenges.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Dr Yisel Pagán-Santana, who also worked on the study, said the findings will help develop 'more adaptable and resilient strategies to ensure the continuity of essential care.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team's hope is that the research will help governments in other regions facing similar challenges to push through policies to help strengthen health care systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior author Dr Karen J. Ortiz-Ortiz concluded: 'By evaluating the impact of events like hurricanes and the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope to start the conversation about long-term solutions to improve cancer care coordination, reduce health disparities, and ensure continued access to care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ultimately, our goal is to help people live longer, healthier lives by making health care systems more resilient and accessible, even in times of crisis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists found that the pandemic lockdowns lead to much higher levels of inflammation in people's bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought that the lack of exposure to common germs weakened our immune systems, leaving us more vulnerable to infections and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in the Netherlands tracked 1,800 people before, during and after the draconian measures, which also included school closures and mask mandates, were imposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lab tests showed that before the lockdowns, patients exposed to a variety of bacteria and viruses generally had low levels of inflammation in their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after the measures were imposed and people were forced to stay home, lab tests showed that exposure to bacteria or viruses lead to 'hyperinflammation'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts said the high levels of inflammation could lead to people suffering from more severe symptoms in response to common infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mihai Netea, the physician who led the study, said: 'In our daily lives, we are constantly exposed to various mico-organisms. This helps train our immune system, teaching it to recognize which micro-organisms are dangerous and which are harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'During the lockdown, we missed that interaction because everyone stayed home and avoided each other. As a result, during and immediately after the lockdown periods, immune cells exposed to micro-organisms displayed a less well-regulated response, predisposing to hyperinflammation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, lockdowns were decided by state, with Democrat states like New York and California heading into the restrictions much faster than their Republican counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Your next computed tomography, or CT, scan might be riskier than commonly assumed. A study out today calculates that CT scans are contributing to a substantially greater share of cancer cases than past research has suggested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, led the research, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505?guestAccessKey=afde7c2e-df6b-4e7b-9ced-7a15ed74dc1d&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=041425"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in JAMA Internal Medicine. They estimated that out of the millions of people who received CT scans in 2023, over 100,000 would eventually develop cancer in their lifetime. The scientists argue that CT scans should be seen as a cancer risk factor on par with excessive alcohol drinking, but at least some outside experts aren’t convinced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CT scans are commonly used to screen for and diagnose potential health problems or to help guide doctors during certain medical procedures. But they require exposing people to doses of ionizing radiation, a known carcinogen. Much of the research on how ionizing radiation increases cancer risk comes from studying the Japanese survivors of the atomic bomb attacks during World War II. But several &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36493793/"&gt;large&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02620-0"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; studies have found a link between the radiation exposure from CT scans and increased cancer cases among children and young adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study authors wanted to conduct an updated analysis of people’s lifetime risk of cancer associated with CT scans across all ages, especially since CT scanning has &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/radiation-risk-from-medical-imaging#:~:text=Over%2080%20million%20CT%20scans%20are%20performed%20in%20the%20United%20States%20each%20year%2C%20compared%20with%20just%20three%20million%20in%201980."&gt;become more common&lt;/a&gt; over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Based on survey data from hospitals and imaging labs across the country, they estimated that there were 93 million CT scans performed on 61.5 million people in 2023. They then calculated that about 100,000 radiation-induced cancers would arise from these exams, based on the expected doses of radiation received and where on the body the test was performed. The risk estimates are about three to four times higher than what past studies have found, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About two million new cancers are diagnosed in the U.S annually. So if Americans’ level of CT use and radiation dose from these tests remain constant, CT scans could eventually account for roughly 5% of all new cancer cases every year—a &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21858#:~:text=excess%20body%20weight%20(7.6%25%20and%207.3%25%2C%20respectively)%2C%20and%20alcohol%20consumption%20(5.4%25%20and%204.1%25%2C%20respectively)."&gt;projected level of risk similar&lt;/a&gt; to obesity (7.6%) and alcohol consumption (5.4%), according to the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“CT is frequently lifesaving, yet its potential harms are often overlooked, and even very small cancer risks will lead to a significant number of future cancers given the tremendous volume of CT use in the United States,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Mark Supanich, head of the division for Diagnostic Medical Physics at Rush University’s Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, isn’t so sure about the team’s math, however. “I believe that the estimates of CT-related cancers predicated by this study are likely overestimated,” Supanich, who is not affiliated with the research, told Gizmodo in an email.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He argues that their numbers are based on some assumptions that might not ultimately hold up.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“A large portion of CT scans are performed on patients who are actively undergoing diagnosis or treatment of significant disease or injury,” he notes. “Including these patients in the statistical estimation of possible future cancers results in a significant overestimation of theoretical future cancer risk.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors did try to account for this factor at least somewhat by removing tests performed in the last year of life from their calculations. In a secondary analysis, they also excluded tests performed up to two years before death, which did lessen their estimate of CT-related cancers. But Supanich argues that the exclusion period should be much longer (one study cited by the authors excluded CT tests performed in the last five years before death, he notes).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Supanich adds that the science is still evolving on how much low-dose radiation truly contributes to cancer risk. So until we can firmly quantify this risk, he says, it’s best to take any claims that CT scans are resulting in a huge number of cancer cases every year with “several large grains of salt.” In light of this uncertainty, he also takes umbrage with the authors’ comparison to other known cancer risk factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In my opinion comparing CT scans as a risk factor for cancer comparable to those of alcohol consumption or excess body weight, as the authors do, is wholly inappropriate and carries with it a significant risk of doing more harm than good,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The authors have called for several reforms in how CT tests are conducted, which might include ordering scans less often in certain scenarios or trying to reduce the radiation dose per test. Supanich notes that there has already been some progress on these fronts. A 2019 report from the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements &lt;a href="https://www.rsna.org/news/2020/march/radiation-doses-decreasing"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that the average medical radiation dose per test (including CT and other imaging procedures) had declined 20% over the past decade, for instance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as scary as this study might look, it seems unlikely that it will be the final word on the cancer risk posed by CT scans. And Supanich says that people in general shouldn’t be too worried about getting their next CT test, given their well-known pros, which can include helping detect cancer early.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The theoretical risks for any individual receiving a CT scan are miniscule compared to current cancer incidence rates (&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/understanding-cancer-risk/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer.html"&gt;about 40%&lt;/a&gt; over an average person’s lifetime) and the benefits for CT are large,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;More Americans are receiving computed tomography (CT) scans than ever before, and while this technology &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/ct-scan-saves-lives"&gt;can save lives&lt;/a&gt;, some scientists are concerned about the potential for low doses of ionizing radiation to increase  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="158103" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At an individual level, the theoretical chance of developing cancer from a CT scan is &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/medical-x-ray-imaging/what-are-radiation-risks-ct"&gt;thought to be very minimal&lt;/a&gt;, if it exists at all, and patients should not be scared of undergoing these tests if they are deemed medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the number of CT examinations performed each year in the US has increased by more than 30 percent since 2007, and researchers suggest that unwarranted tests are exposing the population to unnecessary radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team in the US and the UK now predicts that low levels of ionizing radiation from CT scans could theoretically account for 5 percent of all new cancer diagnoses in the US. CT scans conducted in 2023 could be responsible for an estimated 103,000 future cases of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's based on some assumptions and historical data from high radiation events, but if right, it would put CT scans on par with other significant risk factors for cancer, like alcohol consumption, at least at a population level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"CT is frequently lifesaving, yet its potential harms are often overlooked, and even very small cancer risks will lead to a significant number of future cancers given the tremendous volume of CT use in the United States," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the international team of analysts, led by epidemiologist Rebecca Smith-Bindman from the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of now, these are just theoretical risks, but that doesn't mean they aren't worth considering. While scientists know that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2203/dose-response.07-013.Brooks"&gt;high doses of radiation cause cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6447446/"&gt;conclusive evidence&lt;/a&gt; to link low-level radiation to cancer is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential association is &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/prehospital-and-disaster-medicine/article/risk-of-cancer-from-ct-scans-and-other-sources-of-lowdose-radiation-a-critical-appraisal-of-methodologic-quality/23464B0D825CD456741B77476F9997F7"&gt;mostly based&lt;/a&gt; on long-term studies of atomic bomb survivors and those exposed to nuclear power plant meltdowns. For instance, in a group of &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/radiation-risk-from-medical-imaging"&gt;25,000 Hiroshima survivors&lt;/a&gt;, who received a dose of ionizing radiation on par with three or more CT scans, there was a slight but significant increase in cancer risk across a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether those results extend to CT scans remains &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2672242/"&gt;hotly debated&lt;/a&gt;, and the theoretical risks must be weighed against the myriad benefits of this technology, which can now alert patients and doctors to a whole variety of hidden diseases and injuries with very low doses of radiation (about the same amount &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org.au/iheard/can-radiation-from-medical-tests-cause-cancer"&gt;you absorb from your environment&lt;/a&gt; over three years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new predictions on cancer risk are again based on these historical tragedies, but compared to previous analyses, they consider more detail on the actual radiation exposure, which can &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/radiation-risk-from-medical-imaging"&gt;depend on&lt;/a&gt; the type of CT device, the scanning duration, the size of the patient, and the sensitivity of their targeted body part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anonymous data comes from 143 hospitals and outpatient facilities across the US, catalogued in the UCSF International CT Dose Registry. Using statistics from 2016 to 2022, researchers predicted 93 million CT examinations were carried out in 2023, on roughly 62 million patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the associated radiation risks, the team estimates that CT scans in 2023 may be tied to 103,000 future cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To empirically quantify lifetime risk would require decades-long follow-up studies of very large populations," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505"&gt;admit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, their results suggest that some people may be more susceptible to cancer from low-dose ionizing radiation than others.  Adults receive the vast majority of CT scans, but estimated radiation-induced cancer risks were higher in children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158133" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158133" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-642x368.png" alt="Cancer Risk CT " class="size-medium wp-image-158133" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-642x368.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-724x415.png 724w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-768x440.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-600x344.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT.png 1584w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158133" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The projected number of future cancers (left axis; dark blue and orange circles) against a conservative estimate of cancer incidence (right axis; light blue circles and triangles). &lt;span&gt;(Smith-Bindman et al., &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;2025)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those receiving CT scans at under one year of age, for instance, seem to have a higher potential lifetime risk for thyroid cancers, and this appears more common among female patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far more research is needed to confirm if low-dose ionizing radiation actually impacts a person's cancer risk, and how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Estimated overall cancer risks from CT radiation doses are similarly high in Australian studies, &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/ct-scans-could-be-responsible-for-5-percent-of-new-cancer-diagnoses-every-year"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; medical radiation specialist Pradip Deb from RMIT University. She argues it is important to avoid unnecessary CT scans if radiation-free procedures can do the same job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiographer Naomi Gibson, President of the Australian Society of Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy, agrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although the findings highlight the need for vigilance around long-term radiation exposure, this should not discourage the use of CT imaging when clinically justified," Gibson &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/ct-scans-could-be-responsible-for-5-percent-of-new-cancer-diagnoses-every-year"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In appropriately selected cases, the diagnostic and therapeutic value of CT scans significantly outweighs the potential radiation-associated risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            With the first generation of people exposed widely to technology now &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/09/health/mobility-maintenance-aging-stiffness-wellness/index.html"&gt;approaching old age&lt;/a&gt;, how has its use affected their risk of cognitive decline?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us00053b6o8yyqqdlc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s a question researchers from two Texas universities sought to answer in a new meta-analysis study, a review of previous studies, published Monday in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02159-9" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/a&gt;. The query investigates the “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5855412/" target="_blank"&gt;digital dementia hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;,” which argues that lifetime use may increase reliance on technology and weaken cognitive abilities over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us00063b6ow00z0f2m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We say a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/25/health/maximize-brain-health-wellness/index.html"&gt;really active brain&lt;/a&gt; in youth and midlife is a brain that is more resilient later,” said Dr. Amit Sachdev, medical director of the department of neurology and ophthalmology at Michigan State University, who wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us00073b6o7eujsxjy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the authors discovered that the digital dementia hypothesis may not bear out: Their analysis of 57 studies totaling 411,430 older adults found technology use was associated with a 42% lower risk of cognitive impairment, which was defined as a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, or as subpar performance on cognitive tests.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us00083b6ojh1vebls@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Forms of technology included computers, smartphones, internet, email, social media or “mixed/multiple uses,” according to the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us00093b6obxqnskz9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That these effects were found in studies even when factors like education, income, and other lifestyle factors were adjusted was also encouraging: the effect doesn’t seem just due to other brain health factors,” co-lead study author Dr. Jared Benge, associate professor in the department of neurology at the University of Texas at Austin’s Dell Medical School, said via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000a3b6onxk93iau@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors searched eight databases for studies published through 2024, and the 57 chosen for their main analysis included 20 studies that followed participants for about six years on average and 37 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4885177/" target="_blank"&gt;cross-sectional studies&lt;/a&gt;, which measure health data and outcomes at one point in time. The adults were age 68 on average at the beginning of the studies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000b3b6ojj1it47e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While technology use was generally linked with a lower risk of cognitive decline, the findings for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/16/health/social-media-effect-on-brain-gupta-wellness/index.html"&gt;social media use&lt;/a&gt; were inconsistent, the authors said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000c3b6oqnfqu48j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            None of the 136 studies the authors reviewed overall reported an increased risk of cognitive impairment correlated with technology use — a consistency that is “really quite rare,” said co-lead study author Dr. Michael Scullin, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor University, via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000d3b6owrutczg9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research is “a really well-organized and -executed meta-analysis of essentially the entire field over the last 18 years or 20 years,” said Dr. Christopher Anderson, chief of the division of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Anderson wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000e3b6os9oixldz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But if you’re thinking the study’s findings mean you’re free to use technology to your heart’s content since your brain will be fine anyway — not so fast.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000f3b6oivpuuvrw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our findings are not a blanket endorsement of mindless scrolling,” Benge, who is also a clinical neuropsychologist at UT Health Austin’s Comprehensive Memory Center, said. “They are instead a hint that the generation that gave us the internet has found ways to get some net positive benefits from these tools to the brain.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000g3b6oz7kh0exh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And despite the study’s significance, there are still many uncertainties about the relationships between various aspects of technology use and brain health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm9h68686000w3b6ozprclta3@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="technology-use-and-the-brain" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Technology use and the brain
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000h3b6o7nfxgqn8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the study’s limitations is that it doesn’t have details on how people were using technological devices, experts said. As a result, it’s unclear whether participants were using computers or phones in ways that meaningfully exercised their brains, or what specific way may be most associated with cognitive protection.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000i3b6ouhqsvwwc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lacking information on the amount of time technology was used means it’s also unknown whether there is harmful threshold or if only a little time is needed for cognitive benefits, Anderson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000j3b6oum902oqc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These questions are difficult “to try to answer, because the sheer volume of technology exposures that we have to navigate is so high,” Sachdev said. “To isolate one technology exposure and its effect is difficult, and to measure just a whole ecosystem of technology exposures and … their aggregate effect is also a challenge.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000k3b6oon6l8449@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, “the amount that we can extrapolate from this study towards future generations is very unclear, given the ubiquity of technology today that people are exposed to and have been exposed to from their birth,” Anderson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000l3b6o8me0ru80@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you think about the kind of technology that this cohort would’ve been interacting with earlier in their lives, it’s a time when you had to really work to use technology,” Anderson added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000m3b6ootfk93x4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Their brains were also already well formed, Benge said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000n3b6orv2dsrgv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study may support the alternative to the digital dementia hypothesis, which is the cognitive reserve theory. The theory “contends that exposure to complex mental activities leads to better cognitive well-being in older age,” even in the face of age-related brain changes, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000o3b6o5hhjl0zz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That technology may reduce risk of cognitive decline by helping us be more neurologically active is possible, Sachdev said. Technology use can also foster social connection in some instances, and social isolation has been linked &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/26/health/early-dementia-risk-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;with greater odds&lt;/a&gt; of developing dementia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000p3b6or62e68z9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also possible that older adults who are using technology may already have more active and resilient brains, explaining their engagement with technology.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000q3b6og1k5aerf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Inferences on best practices for technology use in consideration of cognitive health can’t be drawn from the study since it didn’t have specifics on participants’ use habits, experts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000r3b6o2txpflh3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But “it does support that a healthy mix of activities is likely to be the most beneficial, and that fits with other literature on the topic as well,” Anderson said. “What this probably does more than anything else is provide some reassurance that there’s no association between at least moderate use of technology and cognitive decline.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000s3b6oyshv6nev@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Engaging in moderation is best, Sachdev said. And that should largely bring joy, genuine connection, creativity and intellectual stimulation to your life, experts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000t3b6op0jssclh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It should be productive in some way,” he added, and entertaining yourself can sometimes meet that requirement. But if you’re experiencing eye or neck strain from sitting in front of a screen, that’s a sign you’re using technology too much.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000u3b6orovmdicj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Too much of anything can be a bad thing,” Sachdev said. “Identifying the purpose and the duration and then executing along those lines is how we would advise for most topics.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000v3b6o49kn4mz9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some older adults have avoided technology use, thinking it’s too difficult to learn. But Scullin and others have found even people with mild dementia can be trained to use such devices, he said. Though sometimes frustrating, the difficulty “is a reflection of the mental stimulation afforded through learning the device,” Scullin added.

If approved, it would become the first new class of antibiotic for the sexually transmitted infection in more than two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The pill, called gepotidacin, was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-first-new-antibiotic-utis-nearly-30-years-rcna197953" target="_blank"&gt;approved by the Food and Drug Administration in March&lt;/a&gt; to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and girls 12 and up — the most common type of infection in women. The drug is sold under the name Blujepa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A new treatment option is important, experts say, because bacteria that commonly cause STIs are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/superbug-infections-spiked-pandemics-first-wave-rcna37865" target="_blank"&gt;increasingly becoming resistant to the standard antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;, making treatment more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There are an estimated 82 million new cases of gonorrhea globally each year, according to GSK. In the United States, rates of reported gonorrhea have increased 118% from 2009 to 2021, with more than 640,000 cases &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/data-vis/table-trends.html" target="_blank"&gt;being reported&lt;/a&gt; to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Gonorrhea has developed resistance to nearly all the antibiotics used for its treatment, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If left untreated, gonorrhea can &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4217-gonorrhea" target="_blank"&gt;lead to serious &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4217-gonorrhea" target="_blank"&gt;health &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4217-gonorrhea" target="_blank"&gt;complications&lt;/a&gt;, including swollen and painful joints, liver inflammation, and heart and brain damage. It can also increase the risk of infertility in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Gepotidacin is part of a new class of antibiotics called triazaacenaphthylenes, which work by targeting two key enzymes that gonorrhea needs to copy itself and survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a Phase 3 clinical trial of more than 600 adults and teens, gepotidacin was shown to successfully treat about 92% of patients when taken twice daily, compared with about 91% in a group of patients who got a standard treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The most common side effect was gastrointestinal issues, with almost all reported being “mild or moderate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Crucially, the study authors wrote, the pill was effective against strains of gonorrhea bacteria that are resistant to existing antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Sovrin Shah, an associate professor of urology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York who was not involved in the study, called the GSK pill “a welcome addition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea is a public health concern,” Shah said. “The rate of STIs is significant in the U.S.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, said “we desperately need effective cures to combat gonorrhea,” but noted that widespread job cuts at the federal health agencies, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/health/cdc-sti-lab-gonorrhea.html" target="_blank"&gt;including to a lab that tracked STIs&lt;/a&gt;, could make it challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The recent closure of the CDC’s key STI lab — which helps us understand which antibiotics are still effective and when we need to engage new drugs like this — poses a significant new obstacle,” Harvey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A spokesperson for GSK said the company plans to file approval with the FDA “in the coming months” with a regulatory decision expected in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The company said it's seeking approval for gepotidacin as an alternative to first-line therapy when such treatment is inappropriate — such as when the patient is intolerant to the existing treatment or unwilling to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In an editorial that accompanied the study, Magnus Unemo, director of the World Health Organization’s division that oversees gonorrhea, said GSK’s pill is “promising,” but added that challenges to keep gonorrhea as a treatable infection will continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Unemo also stressed improved prevention, including the promotion of safe sex and condom use, early diagnosis and surveillance.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 14:58:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNMFN1S01BWnpGb1VPZkV0SFV3a2RpQ000WDNqQ2c1d052VzRFdnJveXJqdVh1UWVLVTF6bkw1eXhzU3ZvNWhqcUdtSERxbDVhbWlWMUtodTBkRDQzUXpDSzFuV2xON3JLallMNG82WWpBdC04Qy1fZm5TcnNqS0JlRF9hWkZqTy1rUW9TWndBbmttNUVWNWZTTktTZktRUUhRWjdSYlJyeXJSbjk4ZXfSAVZBVV95cUxPY2FJUVBpZzdUbjc5WVZPbGZzSWNBX09HUnlfSlhydDh1Wl9wYXlGS2tpOUpsYkVXVS1ZTXVqNkNlaFU5SGdpdUxraXB6WGw3S2gtaVQzQQ</guid></item><item><title>2025年世界南美锥虫病日-世界卫生组织（ WHO ） | World Chagas Disease Day 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO)</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTFBRR3ZRS3ZCSzE1YjQ4bTcwR1dPQ1A5MjM2dzZCZnhRNTV4Y295em9zOVB0OUpITVUwX0ZJdFg2em5HTWtEX2FZanhwZG9ZSmFIMnFxWnBjcXpYdkdhZFN4ZGZ6LWplOERLQTdj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sf-content-block content-block"&gt;

With &lt;strong&gt;7 million infections&lt;/strong&gt; globally and significant mortality rates, it poses a substantial public health threat. An estimated &lt;strong&gt;10,000 people die&lt;/strong&gt; from Chagas disease every year, and over &lt;strong&gt;100 million people are at risk &lt;/strong&gt;of acquiring the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cases of drug-resistant gonorrhoea have increased rapidly in recent years, reducing the options for treatment. There is an urgent need for new treatments for gonorrhoea, with no new antibiotics found since the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now a study has suggested that gepotidacin, an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections, could be used to fight the infection, ward off drug-resistant cases and improve patient experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The phase-three results of the randomised control trial were &lt;a href="https://info.thelancet.com/e3t/Ctc/RF+113/cs6tF04/VWv4Gr7mW6dnW9lqkYB4d88qQW4dVnpw5vmd6PN5NMMmx3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3mtW2pkwl56Y-W3_W8KCLCf30JPJsW2TxwqZ5S82R-W7yB3yS1lw6nGW8C7rbR8fzhsWW14qklp64DLHCN8sfnYJl4Zy0W8cN2-_1qFvMjW4lB0GF5ChZN3V3NsPt116wn7W4ZcCCH7h_5zzW7-72jm2kwpk3W6SdbRL8ZQXcvN1vQgl44pWD9W1r_LKj46fz1qW4Qmd7N446bJxW8jhgY_7mQh97W5VFTWG2QLpWHW5qqYSW3X6BW9W68HCht5dpv-tVlwfsX6bbh-KVz8ygs7LKZkhVcjV-N8pNbKwW4yFSX78rGxr9W6QsSwj7c1ZTxW8Jn_cG4K6ycFW5glqsv2MmqRWW3yyMZj3-4JsKf2hmF5Y04" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the Lancet journal&lt;/a&gt; and presented at the annual European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) conference in Vienna, Austria, on Monday. The trial was led by UK and US researchers and involved patients from the UK, US, Australia, Germany, Mexico and Spain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the study of 622 patients, researchers compared gepotidacin, taken as a pill, with the standard treatment of ceftriaxone, an injection, and azithromycin, a pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;They found the new pill to be as effective as the standard treatment at tackling the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Crucially, gepotidacin was effective against strains of the gonorrhoea bacteria that are resistant to existing antibiotics. There were no treatment-related severe or serious side-effects for those treated with either medication, the Lancet reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The investigators said the new treatment could be an important tool in combatting the rise of gonorrhoea strains that are becoming resistant to the standard treatment. Additionally, treatment as a pill alone without the need for an injection would probably improve patient experiences and reduce the required healthcare resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The authors said gepotidacin “demonstrated non-inferiority to ceftriaxone plus azithromycin” and offered a “novel oral treatment option for uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhoea”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;They added: “Gepotidacin is a novel oral antibacterial treatment with the potential to become an alternative option for the treatment of gonococcal infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The authors also cautioned that the study looked primarily at urogenital gonorrhoea and that most of the patients were white men. Therefore more research was needed to see the impact of the treatment on gonorrhoea of the rectum and throat, and in women, children, and patients of other ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Gonorrhoea is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, with health officials previously warning it could be untreatable in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/aug/15/gonorrhoea-getting-more-drug-resistant-and-may-become-untreatable" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Last year officials in England issued a warning&lt;/a&gt; about a rise in super-strength cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There were 85,000 cases of gonorrhoea diagnosed in England in 2023, the highest level since records began in 1918.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The vast majority of cases can be treated. But there has been an increase in people diagnosed with strands that are resistant to ceftriaxone, the “first line” antibiotic typically used to treat the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Most of those affected in England were in their 20s, heterosexual, and acquired the infection abroad, though some had no travel history, the UK &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Security Agency (UKHSA) said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/20/antimicrobial-resistance-antibiotic-resistant-bacterial-infections-deaths-lancet-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Global health leaders have previously warned&lt;/a&gt; that antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to humanity, with data showing it has become a leading cause of death worldwide and is killing about 3,500 people every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More than 1.2 million – and potentially millions more – died in 2019 as a direct result of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, according to a comprehensive 2022 estimate of the global impact of antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 14:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNZzF3alpvcjNOdUdCMGZFQmVYUDFmc1lzUzNXOWR4LTcyV1VzVGVxa01WZHl0Wk9KZzZfRG5zNGtfNkNLTTNZZjBYQy0zci1LZHpnT0RNaXVPZEp6Q2RkNlRsdlh0R2xyS21OU1BHcW5KN3I1WjNKUllPOS1jdDR3NWQzNWxsWDlFR0ltS29pS0hiVVFfbGVmZEhOOU40NTUtOUlXaG9HU29nTWE0eVR5NVY5WV9uNDMwbDlmcQ</guid></item><item><title>哺乳期大脑如何重组新陈代谢以生产牛奶-神经科学新闻 | How Lactating Brains Rewire Metabolism for Milk Production - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE83amxQRklJQjJQTUw4bFh1UmY0dFYyeW4yN3U0R2VoeC1pbWdvZ1RXOWtTWU1sUjRuTmNJbWtlUHNiTFpzOVZsVi00MmNzTEtoWGNBRHplNnJBSmZ4TTFzRTF6bDM4bWM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Lactation triggers significant metabolic changes in mothers, driven by shifting hormone levels and brain activity. Researchers have now uncovered how increased prolactin and reduced estrogen suppress specific neurons in the hypothalamus to boost appetite and conserve fat, meeting the energy demands of nursing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing estrogen receptor α (ERα) neurons in this brain region mimicked lactation, while reactivating them reversed these effects. This mechanism not only explains maternal metabolic shifts but may also hold clues for conditions like obesity, menopause, and hyperprolactinemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain-Hormone Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Estrogen receptor α neurons in the hypothalamus regulate prolactin and energy balance during lactation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolic Switch:&lt;/strong&gt; Decreased ERα activity leads to increased appetite and reduced fat-burning to sustain milk production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could inform treatments for obesity, menopause, and high prolactin disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nursing poses major metabolic demands on mothers, to which they respond by eating more and saving energy to sustain milk production. There are significant hormonal changes during lactation, but how they lead to metabolic adaptations in nursing mothers remained unclear. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, which appeared in &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism, &lt;/em&gt;leading researchers at Baylor College of Medicine and Pennington Biomedical Research Center uncovered a mechanism that connects prolactin, estrogen, the brain and metabolic adaptations during lactation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108726"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a mom, baby and brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This work opens exciting avenues for future research on neuroendocrine control of metabolism. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We worked with animal models to investigate how hormones and the brain work together to adapt to the metabolic demands nursing mothers face to sustain milk production,” said co-corresponding author Dr. Chunmei Wang, assistant professor of pediatrics at the USDA/ARS Children’s Nutrition Research Center at Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Normally, estrogen helps control appetite and increases the body’s ability to burn fat, while prolactin does the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During lactation, estrogen levels drop, and prolactin levels rise, leading to increased hunger and reduced fat-burning to compensate for extra energy demands posed by milk production and consumption,” said co-corresponding author Dr. Yanlin He, associate professor at Pennington Biomedical Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that brain cells called estrogen receptor α (ERα) neurons in a small area of the hypothalamus are significantly less active during lactation,” said co-first author Dr. Meng Yu, postdoctoral associate in the Wang lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We showed that when ERα is deleted from these neurons, prolactin levels rise, and the animals increase their appetite and save energy by burning less fat. It was striking to see that just eliminating ERα in this tiny brain region was able to sustain such major metabolic consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When ERα neurons were removed in non-lactating female mice, the animals showed high prolactin levels and lactation-like changes &lt;strong&gt;– &lt;/strong&gt;eating more and burning less fat. Reactivating these neurons in lactating mice reduced these effects, showing their role in controlling metabolism,” He said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am excited that we have discovered a novel mechanism for prolactin regulation,” Wang said. “We knew that prolactin is produced by pituitary cells, and estrogen can act on these cells to increase prolactin levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here we found a novel role of estrogen in regulating prolactin levels – it activates ERα neurons in the hypothalamus, which in turn inhibits prolactin levels during lactation. These findings have potential clinical applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study sheds light on how the brain integrates hormonal signals to regulate energy balance, which could have broader implications for understanding hyperprolactinemia – high levels of prolactin in the blood – obesity, menopause and other conditions where prolactin or estrogen levels shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work opens exciting avenues for future research on neuroendocrine control of metabolism,” He said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other contributors to this work include co-first authors Bing Feng and Jonathan C.

However, the underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we find that oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-expressing neurons in the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH), specifically the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (vlVMH), are suppressed during lactation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deletion of ERα from MBH neurons in virgin female mice induces metabolic phenotypes characteristic of lactation, including hyperprolactinemia, hyperphagia and suppressed BAT thermogenesis. By contrast, activation of ERα&lt;sup&gt;vlVMH&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in lactating mice attenuates these phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, our study reveals an inhibitory effect of E2–ERα&lt;sup&gt;vlVMH&lt;/sup&gt; signalling on PRL production, which is suppressed during lactation to sustain hyperprolactinemia and metabolic adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 14:25:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE83amxQRklJQjJQTUw4bFh1UmY0dFYyeW4yN3U0R2VoeC1pbWdvZ1RXOWtTWU1sUjRuTmNJbWtlUHNiTFpzOVZsVi00MmNzTEtoWGNBRHplNnJBSmZ4TTFzRTF6bDM4bWM</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎疫情是否正在重写老龄化规则？脑衰退警报医生-《华尔街日报》 | Is Covid Rewriting the Rules of Aging?

Heart experts suggest that one kind of exercise is, in fact, "better than" running, swimming, or cycling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with high cholesterol are usually told to make significant changes to their diet to get the issue under control. Lots will also find themselves taking some form of medication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/high-cholesterol/how-to-lower-your-cholesterol/#:~:text=Aim%20to%20do,you%20enjoy%20it." rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;The NHS recommends&lt;/a&gt; most people try out a variety of exercises to find something that will help them achieve about 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of exercise a week. This doesn't mean everyone needs to hit the gym - as exercise comes in so many different forms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People must consider their physical capability and enjoyment when finding what works for them. It's best to find something you look forward to doing as, this way, exercise will feel less like a chore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The health service suggested walking, swimming, and cycling as good starting points. But one type of exercise could be so fun that you'd have a hard time seeing it as exercise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="15030391" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cvhealthclinic.com/news/dance-heart-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Experts at the Cardiovascular Health Clinic&lt;/a&gt; claimed that getting on your feet and dancing could be a great way to improve your heart health. Dr Dwayne Schmidt, a cardiovascular disease specialist, said: "Your heart is a muscle, just like any other in your body, so it benefits from exercise just like any other muscle. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"By getting just 20-30 minutes a day of aerobic exercise, you can improve your heart’s ability to function and dramatically reduce your risk of developing or dying from cardiovascular disease." A boogie on the dancefloor should be enough to get your heart pumping. But, it's often not enough to wipe you out like an intense workout in the gym.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dancing has been shown to improve your lipid profile, a test cardiologists use to measure the different types of fat in your blood. Aerobic exercise like dance can increase your “good” high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels while helping to manage or lower the levels of “bad” low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the kind that contributes to plaque buildup in the arteries and can lead to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="26240015" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; The &lt;a href="https://cvhealthclinic.com/news/dance-heart-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Health Clinic&lt;/a&gt; website claims: "Because it involves movement in all directions and lots of accelerating and decelerating, dancing for cardio can burn up to 300 calories every half-hour, which is more than running, swimming or cycling at a moderate pace. The dopamine and endorphins released while dancing can help improve mood, mental clarity and emotional health." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dancing is a great way to burn calories and improve overall fitness, and it can help those living with high cholesterol for years to come. Many doctors tell them how beneficial it can be to manage their weight and reduce the risk of high cholesterol spiking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; has lots of support and advice for anyone who has been tasked with making lifestyle changes to lower their cholesterol. &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/high-cholesterol/how-to-lower-your-cholesterol/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;You can read more about that here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 13:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOamFIaVExaUpRMzFRY1VYekkyaEpDaTRVTFlMSlpBY2NIcUhPMGtfSEo0d1NhQnRSNm5uVDZUZlFDMFQzSERZT2RVd3FNMERLNTNmMzNzNklqR3o0NjhDYWFpaGNGVURQNUE2eEhMOXhYYnFwdEMybUJONGxmQXNSbTd2cGNnaDJpSGVKdTBTUFQ4Y2Jw</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现脑部疾病的17个风险因素- Newser | Scientists Find 17 Risk Factors for Brain Disease - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQbVRIdXFNWHAydmVQeVNHSFBXMlpTVkJCd3lxY0lLdzZkc01hSXFBX2xPOFd1U0liZnRjc0pWVzlHTldRdnl6MWdBb3lmdndaZUI4dkZUNXhKc3R5WklVSV9NVlQ4dXlUajBCWi1rUjI1cVEzWmVEdHN5UjVCdkQ1QXNkVlZCbGdZc1lWVFNhQUZWYW9weTBfUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;

                                        Looking for ways to keep the brain healthy in later life? A new study has identified 17 risk factors tied to three age-related brain diseases—all of which can be altered through behavioral changes. Researchers at Mass General Brigham reviewed meta-analyses of risk factors associated with stroke, dementia, and late-life depression, finding 17 modifiable factors shared by at least two of the diseases, per the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/14/stroke-dementia-depression-kidney-disease/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These include alcohol, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, body mass index, cholesterol, diet, hearing loss, kidney function, pain, physical activity, sleep, social engagement, smoking, and stress.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Researchers then predicted the impact each risk factor had on quality of life and mortality. High blood pressure and severe kidney disease had the greatest negative impact, while engagement in physical activity and cognitive leisure activities, like reading or puzzles, appeared best for lowering risk, the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; reports. As all 17 factors can be controlled through healthy behaviors, "this means there are real opportunities for prevention," Dr. Sanjula Singh, principal investigator at MGH's Brain Care Labs and lead author of the study published this month in the &lt;a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/21/jnnp-2024-334925"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tells &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/stroke-dementia-depression-share-17-preventable-risk-factors"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Taken as a whole, the 17 risk factors can seem overwhelming so it's best to look at them as a "menu of options," says Singh. "Whether it's managing your blood pressure, staying physically active, eating well or maintaining social connections, small changes in your daily routine can help you take better care of your brain over time." She notes "one to three small, realistic changes can already make a meaningful difference" and "progress in one area often supports progress in others" since many of the risk factors are interconnected. More physical activity, for example, may lower blood pressure and improve sleep at the same time.  (More &lt;a href="/tag/4072/1/brain.html"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; stories.)

The research, which surveyed over 600 UK frontline officers, found that 38% had experienced at least one TBI, often accompanied by symptoms like confusion or memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officers with repeated TBIs reported severe impacts on daily life, including difficulties in work, relationships, and mental health. Researchers call for routine brain injury assessments and tailored support protocols similar to concussion models used in sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High TBI Rates:&lt;/strong&gt; 38% of surveyed officers had sustained at least one TBI, compared to 12% in the general population.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PTSD Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Officers with TBIs were over twice as likely to develop complex PTSD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for Reform:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers urge brain injury assessments and rapid-access care to prevent long-term harm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Police officers are more than twice as likely to have traumatic brain injuries compared to the general population. Officers who incur these injuries while on duty face more than double the risk of developing complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s according to a new survey-based study from the University of Exeter, published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation&lt;/em&gt;, which found a connection between traumatic brain injuries and PTSD in police officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108718"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/police-TBI-PTSD-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/police-TBI-PTSD-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/police-TBI-PTSD-neurosceince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/police-TBI-PTSD-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/police-TBI-PTSD-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/police-TBI-PTSD-neurosceince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/police-TBI-PTSD-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/police-TBI-PTSD-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows a police officer and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/police-TBI-PTSD-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/police-TBI-PTSD-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/police-TBI-PTSD-neurosceince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/police-TBI-PTSD-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/police-TBI-PTSD-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/police-TBI-PTSD-neurosceince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/police-TBI-PTSD-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Many officers are grappling with the lingering effects from past injuries while simultaneously managing PTSD symptoms and this creates a double burden that can significantly impair their ability to work, have healthy relationships, and overall quality of life. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authors say the findings raise concerns over the long-term effects on officers’ personal and professional lives and highlights the need for better action and support for officers who have sustained a head trauma in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Stan Gilmour has 30 years’ experience in law enforcement and received The King’s Police Medal for his service. He is now a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Exeter and co-convenor of the Global Law Enforcement and Public Health Association’s Neurodisability Special Interest Group. Stan said: “Police officers are exposed to high-stress situations, physical confrontations, and the possibility of injury every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adding to that the increased risk of traumatic brain injuries and PTSD only compounds the challenges officers already face, and this study highlights the urgent need for better monitoring of head injuries and their long-term effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study surveyed 617 current serving frontline police officers from England, Scotland, and Wales and found 38 per cent had sustained at least one traumatic brain injury – defined as an injury to the head that caused someone to lose consciousness, or develop symptoms such as confusion, disorientation, or memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is compared to the rate of 12 percent found in the general population. Of those officers, 61 percent report they had experienced these types of injuries on multiple occasions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found police officers who reported a history of multiple traumatic brain injuries were more than twice as likely to meet the criteria for complex PTSD – which has similar symptoms to PTSD, but may also include feelings of worthlessness, shame and guilt, problems controlling emotions, and relationship issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, 22 percent of respondents had sustained traumatic brain injuries during their policing duties and these officers were more than twice as likely to develop probable complex PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results found police officers with a history of multiple traumatic brain injuries also face more severe difficulties in their daily lives, including their ability to perform work duties, maintain relationships, and carry out other important activities like parenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also reported physical and cognitive symptoms at a more severe level, including headaches, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and concentration problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study calls for assessments for traumatic brain injuries and related symptoms during routine occupational health checks, with targeted interventions for officers who experience both a traumatic brain injury and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick Smith, lead researcher and Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Exeter, said: “Our findings highlight a critical gap in support for police officers who suffer traumatic brain injuries and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many officers are grappling with the lingering effects from past injuries while simultaneously managing PTSD symptoms and this creates a double burden that can significantly impair their ability to work, have healthy relationships, and overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Early action and support are essential to prevent long-term consequences and improve outcomes for these officers. For example, police forces could emulate concussion guidelines in sport by developing traumatic brain injury assessments and graduated return-to-duty protocols, which are crucial to reduce risk of further injury when still symptomatic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey is the largest of its kind to examine the link between policing, traumatic brain injuries and PTSD, and included participants from across the UK. As the research was survey-based, the data is self-reported – however, researchers took steps to ensure it was not obvious to respondents that they were investigating links between head injuries and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study entitled “Co-occurrence of Traumatic Brain Injury and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in a National Sample of UK Police Officers: Impact on Social Well-being and Employment Outcomes” was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and is published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Something had changed in my mentality”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Ockenden is a current serving Police Sergeant who developed PTSD following a road traffic collision while on duty. In November 2022, Tim was driving with a colleague on a blue light run when they were hit by another car going through traffic lights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After I was physically checked after the incident, I came back into work the next day,” Tim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tried to crack on like normal, but something wasn’t quite right. Something had changed in my mentality. I really noticed a shift in my behaviour, and I’d get angry at the drop of a hat. I couldn’t put my finger on what was wrong. I’d never been an anxious person before, but I started to get anxious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim was then off work for three months with stress and burnout and around the same time his wife gave birth to their son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was absolutely loving my home life, but I would also turn on a dime,” he continued. “It probably got to its worst about five months after the incident when I was in the shops with my wife and son, and she was asking me what I wanted for lunch. I couldn’t process it, and I just lost it. I got really angry and shouted at my wife, which I’d never done before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She told me I’d changed over the past few months and around the same time a colleague pulled me aside and said, ‘nobody wants to work with you. Nobody wants to even sit in the same office as you. You need to get some help because something’s not right’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim sought help through official work channels and his GP surgery, but was told support could take months or even longer. He then reached out to independent charity Police Care UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim said: “By the following week I’d spoken to somebody on the phone and by the end of the week I’d had a clinician assessment. Two weeks later I started therapy for PTSD. It’s made a massive difference, sort of resetting myself, and I’m back to relative normality now. But I can still get angry really easily, which I never used to before. I can sense my PTSD symptoms building and if I don’t correct them in time I lose it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim says from what he’s experienced as a police officer, the findings from the research don’t surprise him: “For me, this study is long overdue because I think there are huge numbers within the police with undiagnosed PTSD. I’m a big rugby fan and I’d like to see some sort of protocol put in place similar to the head injury assessment in sports. Something that isn’t subjective but&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a pass or fail and identifies if someone is at risk PTSD. Then it’s equally important what care is in place after that is identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those two things need to go hand in hand – the protocol and then the treatment. People can’t wait six months. If you fail the test on the Monday, then on the Tuesday you’re getting help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this TBI and c-PTSD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1565677066667a73737c767055706d706170673b74763b607e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Louise Vennells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://exeter.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Louise Vennells – University of Exeter&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/HTR.0000000000001041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Co-Occurrence of Traumatic Brain Injury and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in a National Sample of UK Police Officers: Impact on Social Well-Being and Employment Outcomes&lt;/a&gt;” by Stan Gilmour et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co-Occurrence of Traumatic Brain Injury and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in a National Sample of UK Police Officers: Impact on Social Well-Being and Employment Outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Objective: &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine the lifetime prevalence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in UK police officers and evaluate associations between mild TBI (mTBI), persistent post-concussion-like symptoms (PPCS), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (C-PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Setting: &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online survey of serving police officers across England, Scotland and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Participants: &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 617 currently serving police officers were eligible for the study and the final sample consisted of 573 participants. Subgroup comparisons were made between individuals with no TBI history (n = 355), a single mTBI (n = 88) and multiple mTBIs (n = 130).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Design: &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional survey assessing lifetime history of TBI, PPCS and PTSD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Main measures: &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifetime TBI prevalence was assessed with the Ohio State TBI-Identification Method. Post-concussion-like symptoms were evaluated with the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) and PTSD/C-PTSD were measured using the International Trauma Questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results: &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifetime prevalence of TBI was 38% (n = 234), with 23% reporting multiple TBIs. One-way ANOVAs demonstrated that individuals with multiple TBIs exhibited significantly greater cognitive (unadjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = .02, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .001) and somatic symptoms (unadjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = .02, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001) and reported more severe total RPQ symptoms (unadjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = .02, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .009) compared to those without mTBI history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple TBI history was associated with increased severity across all PTSD/C-PTSD domains (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .004), and a significantly higher C-PTSD prevalence (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .001). These results remained significant in ANCOVAs, adjusting for demographic, occupational and trauma-exposure variables (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .04).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comorbidity between TBI and C-PTSD is prevalent in this sample of police officers. Symptom endorsement is additive in those with mTBI history, this could lead to risk to employment, relationship breakdown, and further mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routine occupational health checks should monitor both TBI and associated symptoms over time. If necessary, police officers with head or neck injuries should follow a graduated return-to-duty protocol, including a gradual increase in activity level and appropriate mental health intervention.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 13:30:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYkFVX3lxTE5uaEhmLXFDaHh2RmFtNlBBc1AtclliUHROeDBIZ09NandPQnJIVGNVN3NFUE4yWVdPMEJHVjRHUzFmN2VYcFlrV05jbHdtcWVMc3QtU0dhNk5Td05NMWtsYWRB</guid></item><item><title>伊利县报告了2例新的麻疹病例；疫苗诊所已预定-伊利新闻 | 2 New Measles Cases Reported in Erie County; Vaccine Clinic Scheduled - Erie News Now</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxOeHpZY1JGNUlmdkF6RzJpOFVBUFlMQTlBWFF3WlBDR29rZGYtM1NHNkZ4dkE3SDhoM2lTNDBEbmRLR2hlS3JMM2RIU2tDaG13QThseDlzLV81dzk3SVQ4ZlRnM0I2b0tvZ1RqcUgwQ2JkZGZaSW9TNFFZNF85UkxwTlpjVVhSR3VGbXhyMEh6UHZuZ0oxcHUtWHFSQ2hoN2R2cWpjZFZzY3ZiZUlOTk51dQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="Article-paragraph" data-reactid="493"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the risk of community spread is low, thanks to contact tracing and quarantines.

ROACH: I see screening tests advertised often. For $160 I can get screened for conditions that might cause stroke, heart disease, aneurysms, etc. My partner and I are in our early and mid-60s. Should we get these done? -- K.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HLTDH3X4UJDZDFQSJEQMO4CTCU"&gt;ANSWER: Sometimes, screening tests make a great deal of sense; other times, they don’t. It all depends on how likely it is that a person would have the condition in question. For example, screening for an aneurysm of the aorta has been proven to save lives in men between 65 and 75 with any history of smoking, and can be considered in other people, especially if there is a family history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PRLZANK4TJDGRK3SMPPMXKADVE"&gt;On the other hand, many stand-alone screening centers offer ultrasound evaluation of the carotid arteries in the neck, but expert groups such as the US Preventive Services Task Force recommend against it in people without symptoms. They have concluded that screening for blockages of the carotid arteries in people without symptoms is more likely to result in harm than benefit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OOIZPSL6F5FBRH5UCX2VA3YKWY"&gt;The main harm comes from false-positive ultrasounds, which often must be confirmed by an angiogram. About 1% of people get a stroke during an angiogram, which is more than the expected benefit of finding and treating blockages in a person with no symptoms.

I had a family member get the screening done, and shortly after he died of a heart attack, a letter came from the center saying he should follow up with a cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5TBQKJYWVRFW7KCQQQIU43V7OQ"&gt;In my opinion, screening tests should be decided on by your doctor, who knows your medical history.

ROACH: I am an 81-year-old man in fairly good health, I think, except for osteoporosis. Three years ago, I had a very weak pulse rate and was hospitalized. My wife thought I was having a stroke. The cardiologist had a pacemaker implanted, and I’ve been good since. But two months ago, the cardiologist listened to my chest and said I had a murmur, a word I didn’t know. She also said “sinuses” and “plaque” and “valve.” She ordered an echocardiogram, which I’ve had, but don’t know the results yet. Am I in danger? If so, how much? -- W.C.G.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RQQNXLXNRFGWFCYCVMQGG4AWAE"&gt;ANSWER: By now, I hope and expect that your cardiologist will have told you not to worry. A “murmur” is just a sound that doctors can hear from the heart, which sometimes mean that there is damage to one of the four valves of the heart. Guessing by the terms she used, I think your cardiologists is concerned you may have calcium (“plaque”) in the aortic valve, which is supported by the sinuses of Valsalva in the aortic root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OWIHBNBAWFECPLDHDAYBRCFNXU"&gt;Calcium in the aortic valve by itself may not cause problems, but it can keep the valve from being able to open all the way, a condition called aortic stenosis. It isn’t always easy to hear the difference between aortic valve calcification and aortic stenosis, but an echocardiogram gives a very accurate measurement of the aortic valve opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FTVZ7VQJQRFOJC72XYCGQFD2BY"&gt;If you have aortic stenosis, she will discuss your options, which may include surgery if it is severe. However, if you have the more common calcification without stenosis, she will make sure your blood pressure and cholesterol are controlled, and will likely redo the echo in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers noted, reductions in off periods were matched by improvements in good on time, when symptoms are well controlled, among patients taking part in a clinical study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new results come from the extension part of the &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02339064"&gt;Phase 3 INFUS-ON trial (NCT02339064)&lt;/a&gt;, which assessed the therapy’s long-term use in people with advanced Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data were presented in a poster, titled “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/msa/Public/Events/AbstractDetails/59282"&gt;Continuous Subcutaneous Apomorphine Infusion for Parkinson Disease Motor Fluctuations: Long-term Data from the Ongoing InfusON Extension Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” at this year’s American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting, held April 5-9, in San Diego and online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These data support the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of adjunctive [or add-on treatment],” the researchers wrote in the presentation’s abstract.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Onapgo approved in US earlier this year to reduce Parkinson’s off time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-causes-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s is caused&lt;/a&gt; by the dysfunction and death of dopaminergic neurons, the nerve cells responsible for producing dopamine, which is a signaling molecule involved in motor control. Standard treatment includes &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-treatments/"&gt;levodopa&lt;/a&gt;, which contains a molecule cells can use to produce dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levodopa is usually effective at controlling Parkinson’s &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. However, its long-term use is associated with off episodes, when the medication’s effects wear off between doses, as well as &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/dyskinesia/"&gt;dyskinesia&lt;/a&gt;, or sudden, uncontrolled movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onapgo is a formulation of apomorphine, a medication that mimics dopamine’s activity in the brain, that’s now &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/spn-380-onapgo-wins-fda-ok-advanced-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;approved in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; as an adjunctive, or add-on, treatment to manage off episodes in people with advanced Parkinson’s. It is delivered as a continuous subcutaneous, or under-the-skin, infusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment’s approval was based on data from the INFUS-ON trial, sponsored by &lt;a href="https://www.supernus.com/"&gt;Supernus Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;, the company that markets the treatment in the U.S. All of the investigators involved in the new clinical study are Supernus employees or have served as paid consultants to the pharmaceutical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INFUS-ON was an open-label study that assessed the safety and efficacy of Onapgo in 99 adults with advanced Parkinson’s at 19 sites in the U.S. Participants had a mean age of 61.6, and a mean disease duration of 10 years. Slightly more than two-thirds (69%) were men. Overall, these patients experienced motor fluctuations for a mean of 6.6 hours per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onapgo was started with a small 1-2 mg dose, followed by a steady infusion of 1 mg per hour. The dose was slowly adjusted to find the best balance between effectiveness and side effects, without taking more than 8 mg per hour or 150 mg per day. This was followed by a one year maintenance period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who completed the maintenance period could continue treatment in an ongoing extension period. Data from the maintenance period demonstrated the treatment was generally safe and well tolerated, and &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/aan-2023-apomorphine-infusion-pump-spn-830-reduces-off-time/"&gt;reduced off time&lt;/a&gt; while increasing good on time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;In self-reported ratings, over 85% of patients called themselves ‘improved’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At AAN, the researchers shared results from up to three years of treatment during the extension part of the trial. Among the 48 patients who completed the maintenance period, 45 continued to the extension phase. Of them, 27 completed a total of two or more years of treatment, with 22 having three or more years, through January 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results remained positive, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By week 12, mean … daily off time decreased, … and this was sustained at the [one]-year … [two]-year … and [three]-year … visits,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, “corresponding week 12 increases in good on time were [seen] from … baseline [and] … also sustained at the [one]-year … [two]-year … and [three]-year … visits,” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onapgo was generally safe and well tolerated over the three years of treatment, with adverse events mainly occurring during the dose adjustment period. The most common adverse events were nausea, somnolence, or daytime sleepiness, and dizziness; these symptoms were infrequent in the long term. Although nodules at the infusion site were common, they were rarely severe, and no infusion site infections occurred during this period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;The fraction of participants who rated themselves as improved compared to baseline … was 90% at [one] year, 90% at [two] years, and 86% at [three] years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, treatment reduced daily off time by more than three hours per day, an effect that persisted through three years of treatment. Alongside that decrease was the corresponding increase of more than three hours of good on time daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large number of participants — more than 85% overall — consistently said they felt better compared with baseline, or when they started treatment, based on a self-assessment tool. This stayed true throughout all three years of the study, showing that the improvement was meaningful and lasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fraction of participants who rated themselves as improved compared to baseline … was 90% at [one] year, 90% at [two] years, and 86% at [three] years,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

This adaptive behavior is controlled by a mechanosensitive protein channel called PIEZO1, which detects mechanical stress and triggers a shift in how the cell’s internal motors generate movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When navigating confined environments, PIEZO1 activates a calcium signal that pushes the nucleus forward, allowing neurons to squeeze through narrow spaces. These findings challenge previous beliefs about fixed migration types and may have implications for treating brain injury and cancer metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PIEZO1 Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Neurons use the mechanosensitive protein PIEZO1 to detect mechanical stress and adapt their migration mode.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mode Switching:&lt;/strong&gt; Neurons pull themselves forward on flat surfaces but push through confined spaces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Insights could help enhance neuron repair after brain injury and improve understanding of cancer metastasis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Kindai University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the developing brain, neurons must navigate through complex and often crowded tissue to reach their final destinations—this process is crucial for proper brain formation and function. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to how we might choose different methods of locomotion depending on terrain, neurons apparently employ distinct migration strategies based on various factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108714"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a neuron." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The key to this adaptive behavior is a mechanosensitive protein channel called PIEZO1, which detects mechanical stress when neurons attempt to pass through confined spaces. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, scientists have observed different migration mechanisms across different neuron types. For example, migrating forebrain interneurons use myosin to exert a pushing force on the nucleus, whereas cerebellar granule neurons in culture dishes use actomyosin to generate a traction force that pulls the nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the precise mechanisms governing these migration modes remain underexplored, particularly how neurons switch strategies in response to environmental changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent study, a research team led by Lecturer Naotaka Nakazawa of the Department of Energy and Materials, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Kindai University, Japan, has discovered that neurons can switch between different migration modes depending on whether they are moving across an unencumbered flat surface or squeezing through confined three-dimensional spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their paper, which was made available online on March 6, 2025, reveals a sophisticated mechanosensing mechanism that allows neurons to adapt their movement strategy to navigate the complex architecture of the developing brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was co-authored by Mineko Kengaku of Kyoto University, Gianluca Grenci of the National University of Singapore, Yoshitaka Kameko of Shibaura Institute of Technology, and Keiko Nonomura of Kyoto University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper was made available online on March 6, 2025, and was published in Volume 44, Issue 3 of &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt; on March 25, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In previous observations, we noticed that the nucleus in migrating neurons was significantly deformed in brain tissue. At the same time, migrating neurons sometimes exhibited dynamics different from those reported,” explains Nakazawa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We speculated that such irregular dynamics in migrating neurons might be activated as they pass through confined spaces in brain tissue, because the nucleus is deformed when the cell receives external mechanical stress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using innovative techniques including microfluidic devices, computer simulations, and live imaging of brain cells and tissues, the researchers observed the migration of cerebellar granule neurons—a type of neuron found in the cerebellum—in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2D cultures, the protein complex responsible for movement—actomyosin—concentrates at the front of the migrating neuron, pulling the cell forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when the same neurons encounter confined 3D spaces, they redistribute this machinery to the back of the cell, creating a pushing force that helps squeeze the cell through tight spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to this adaptive behavior is a mechanosensitive protein channel called PIEZO1, which detects mechanical stress when neurons attempt to pass through confined spaces. When activated, PIEZO1 triggers calcium influx into the cell, initiating a signaling cascade that relocates the cell’s motor proteins to the rear membrane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This repositioning generates contractile forces that help propel the cell forward through narrow passages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers confirmed the critical role of PIEZO1 by demonstrating that neurons lacking this protein could migrate normally in unconfined environments but struggled significantly when navigating confined spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings challenge previous assumptions that different types of neurons inherently use different migration strategies, suggesting instead that neurons possess the ability to adapt their movement mechanisms based on their immediate surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of providing deep insights into important biological aspects of neuronal migration, the findings of this study could have relevant medical implications as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the brain is damaged, neuronal precursors called neuroblasts migrate to the lesion,” says Nakazawa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the future, our findings may help develop therapeutic techniques to restore brain function by enhancing neuronal migration in the confined spaces of brain tissue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worth noting is that the mechanisms underlying cell migration are fundamental to many biological processes beyond the brain, including embryonic development, immune responses, and cancer metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer cells, for instance, must navigate through various tissue environments during metastasis, potentially employing similar adaptive strategies to neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how cells sense and respond to physical constraints could therefore inform new approaches to diagnosing and treating conditions ranging from developmental disorders to metastatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let us hope more studies in this intriguing field help us clarify how neurons and other cell types find their way within our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cfa4a0a7a08fa4a6a1abaea6e1aeace1a5bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tamaki Kasuya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://kindai.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kindai University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tamaki Kasuya – Kindai University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PIEZO1-dependent mode switch of neuronal migration in heterogeneous microenvironments in the developing brain&lt;/a&gt;” by Naotaka Nakazawa et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PIEZO1-dependent mode switch of neuronal migration in heterogeneous microenvironments in the developing brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The migration of newborn neurons is essential for brain morphogenesis and circuit formation, yet controversy exists regarding how neurons generate the driving force against strong mechanical stresses in crowded neural tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that cerebellar granule neurons employ a mechanosensing mechanism to switch the driving forces to maneuver in irregular brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two-dimensional (2D) cultures, actomyosin is enriched in the leading process, exerting traction force on the cell soma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tissue or 3D confinement, however, actomyosin concentrates at the posterior cell membrane, generating contractile forces that assist passage through narrow spaces, working alongside the traction force in the leading process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3D migration is initiated by the activation of a mechanosensitive channel, PIEZO1. PIEZO1-induced calcium influx in the soma triggers the PKC-ezrin cascade, which recruits actomyosin and transmits its contractile force to the posterior plasma membrane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, migrating neurons adapt their motility modes in distinct extracellular environments in the developing brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 12:49:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1pdVpLTzZNdnpSd0E5RnNKYVZDTldQVU5VbDE3eXRmRXZjcFpMN1AxSDl6bnRtLXU1NlhmOEhQT1dRNUVYSS1CZ1VneXgwMDdTTlJQRVNXU1pOanBmREFCa3lBQi1VZWpWZG42Y2lWNzA3SjhqOUE</guid></item><item><title>他已经决定要死了。陌生人向他祈祷—和晚餐邀请-今日美国 | He’s decided to die.

I am bipolar, and I moved to the Netherlands to legally end my life. I’m not special, I’m just ready.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/okuntakinte/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Awuah-Darko&lt;/a&gt;, a 28-year-old British-Ghanaian artist, has documented his battle with &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/11/30/what-is-bipolar-disorder/71636701007/#:~:text=That's%20about%2011.3%20million%20people,day%2Dto%2Dday%20activities." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;treatment-resistant bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt; for years. After contemplating &lt;a href="/story/news/nation/2025/03/31/terri-schiavo-death-after-20-years/82696234007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;assisted dying&lt;/a&gt; for five years, he is now pursuing the treatment under the public eye on grounds of mental suffering. In the Netherlands, &lt;a href="https://www.government.nl/topics/euthanasia" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;assisted euthanasia for psychiatric conditions is legal&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a lengthy approval process. His announcement has been met with mixed reactions — curiosity, horror, sympathy, prayers, confessions of shared struggles and even pleas to change his mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“What usually happens when you cry on the internet is that people bully you and create memes from your ugly crying,” he says from Amsterdam, over the phone in late March. “To my shock and a bit of my bemusement, that didn't happen to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Amid accusations of “&lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/07/30/suicide-prevention-dad-story-website-teen-phone/74507915007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;romanticizing suicide&lt;/a&gt;,” the most shocking response was not the criticism or praise — but a dinner invitation. Hundreds of strangers invited Awuah-Darko to share a meal, inspiring him to start a worldwide tour of dinners with strangers, which he has coined the "Last Supper Project." As he awaits a decision on his request for euthanasia, he’s had 93 dinners and received over 4,000 invitations. He's traveled to Paris, Milan, Brussels and Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Dinner is a very, if not the most, intimate and intentional part of anyone's day," he says. "For me, that has just been a special way of fostering remarkable relationships and connections during the time I have left."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;One of his most impactful dinners was with a Surinamese mother who struggled with suicidal ideation and postpartum depression. She invited her kids to the table for a guided discussion over homemade Surinamese sourdough soup. At his 30th dinner, he met his friend Emmanual, who suffers from C-PTSD and has been scheduled to die on July 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Awuah-Darko, who has attempted suicide in the past, calls himself “just one person among millions” struggling with bipolar disorder and chronic suicidality — but he understands the power of social media to amplify a story. “If people choose to see it as romanticizing, I think that more reflects on them,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But under the watchful eyes of over 560,000 Instagram followers, Awuah-Darko undoubtedly has an impact. Whether that is “good” or “bad” is still debated, and bioethicists and mental health experts say the answer may lie in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/12/USAT/83059483007-img-5052.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=516&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/12/USAT/83059483007-img-5052.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=1032&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Awuah-Darko has had 93 dinners and counting with strangers through the 'Last Supper Project'"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Awuah-Darko has had 93 dinners and counting with strangers through the 'Last Supper Project'" data-c-credit="Joseph Awuah-Darko"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;'People should be able to talk about uncomfortable, inconvenient things'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Assisted dying for psychiatric conditions is a complicated ethical dilemma with many “right” answers, according to bioethicists. While it’s imperative to spark open conversations around mental health and suicide, mental health experts caution that romanticization can ignite contagion suicide (also known as “copycat suicides” or the “Werther effect”). In contrast, the "Papegeno effect" is the effect that mass media can have by presenting positive examples of hope and non-suicide alternatives to crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“We know from studies that this can be a real risk, but also protective for some,” says Manuel Trachsel, a bio and medical ethics professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland who co-authored a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9306695/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; on assisted dying for severe and persistent mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As for the mixed reactions to Awuah-Darko — including those praying for him to change his mind — some people “predominantly fear the Wether effect, and others see the chance of the Papageno effect,” Trachsel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nami.org/about-nami/who-we-are/meet-our-leadership/ken-duckworth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Ken Duckworth&lt;/a&gt;, a triple board-certified psychiatrist and the Chief Medical Officer at the National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI), affirms that talking about suicide &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24998511/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;will not put the idea into people’s heads&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735818301351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;improve treatment-seeking behaviors&lt;/a&gt;. But social media, he says, gets complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I can't speak to how much he's suffering, and that is his decision. But making it such a public event does strike me as problematic,” says Duckworth. He worries that people considering suicide may fall susceptible to the contagion effect if they see Awuah-Darko as “cool” or “inspirational."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But Awuah-Darko doesn’t think he’s romanticizing suicide, nor does he want to. Rather, he wants to avoid people not talking about it at all. Still, he knows that bringing attention to assisted suicide doesn’t come without criticism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“My biggest curse, and I guess blessing sometimes, is my awareness of all this, and yet still choosing to do it,” he says. “I think people should be able to talk about uncomfortable, inconvenient things without being accused of romanticizing it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Awuah-Darko is not interested in people who are "more interested in playing offense, politics and collective outrage" than having a nuanced conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He continues, “I think what people inadvertently say when they speak about their discomfort with seeing me talk about the dignity of medically assisted death is that they would rather I not talk about it, which means to continue this dangerously culpable culture of people ending their lives in private and in shame."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/12/USAT/83059485007-img-8583.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=376&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/12/USAT/83059485007-img-8583.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=752&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt='In Ghana, Awuah-Darko says food is "spiritual and remarkably therapeutic."'&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption='In Ghana, Awuah-Darko says food is "spiritual and remarkably therapeutic."' data-c-credit="Joseph Awuah-Darko"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;The ethics of assisted dying versus evidence that suicide is preventable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Trachsel says an autonomy-based ethical argument for assisted suicide for psychiatric conditions is that “every person has the right to determine the time and circumstances of their death” and we should not “discriminate” between those with psychiatric disorders and persons with somatic diseases.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;However, for mood disorders, such as bipolar disorder, suicidal ideation can be a transient state, according to Duckworth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The mood states are inherently complicated. Helplessness and hopelessness are criteria of depression. Poor judgment and impulsivity are features of mania,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Awauh-Darko, who lives with chronic suicidality, struggles to navigate oscillations between manic productivity and deep lows, like many individuals with bipolar disorder, he says. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at age 16, but doesn't remember a time without its symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"You still essentially fear, or are almost terrified of joy, because you know that a deep depression beckons right around the corner," he says. "You do get fatigued of constantly trying to be okay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.iasp.info/our_team/lars-mehlum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Lars Mehlum&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry and suicidology, believes that chronic suicidality is still treatable and that doctors too often “give up” on patients who are regarded as untreatable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“People who are advocating for euthanasia look at it as some sort of linear process. It's not. It's very transactional and also volatile,” says Mehlum, who is also the founding director of the National Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Oslo Institute of Clinical Medicine. He co-authored a &lt;a href="https://bpded.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40479-020-00131-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; on assisted suicide for people with personality disorders. “For example, people who are suicidal can very much be deeply suicidal in the moment. But in extreme cases, you can change suicidality within five minutes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Duckworth’s research also illustrates that suicide is preventable — a rigorously studied belief shared by prominent mental health organizations like &lt;a href="https://988lifeline.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;988 Lifeline&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://988lifeline.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;American Foundation for Suicide Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, according to their mission statements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When working on NAMI’s book, “&lt;a href="https://www.nami.org/support-education/publications-reports/you-are-not-alone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;You Are Not Alone: The NAMI Guide to Navigating Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;,” he interviewed 130 people, many of whom were suicidal in their 20s, but not in their 30s or 40s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The 20s are a difficult time in general, in life and in mental health conditions,” he explains. Finding companionship and joining peer support groups, along with the development of innovative treatments, were protective factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Mehlum says it can take 20 years for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3241518/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;research evidence to reach clinical practice&lt;/a&gt;. New treatments are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39427446/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;continuously studied&lt;/a&gt;. Prozac, one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants, was developed in the 1970s, but didn’t become widely available until 1988. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Duckworth argues that Awuah-Darko is pursuing one of his recommended treatments — regardless of intention — through the “Last Supper Project” by building strong social connections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In the United States and Awuah-Darko’s home of London, assisted death for mental health suffering is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;'Life has surprised me'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Awuah-Darko speaks with poise and intention, but he is self-aware of this juxtaposition. Some may see his apparent put-togetherness as contradictory to his suffering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“While I may sound sanitized, composed and be able to structure sentences on this phone call, it doesn't mean that I'm not masking or that I'm not having to navigate complex emotions,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He also says he couldn’t care less about being profiled in any capacity, at least not for personal fame. Rather, Awuah-Darko wants his story to reach people, whether through Instagram or this article, who feel alone in their battles, even if that comes with backlash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I have gotten messages and letters, thousands of which have spoken to how liberating people find my ability to speak so openly about what I'm going through,” he says. “And that's worth it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Society extends more grace in hindsight, he says. Instagram comment sections are flooded with hearts and flowers; the media memorializes a tragedy. “But when someone chooses to confront it as a living person, there tends to be vitriol,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On average, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9251055/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;5% of people&lt;/a&gt; who apply for assisted death for psychiatric conditions in the Netherlands are approved. Between 2012 and 2021, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2828937#:~:text=Findings%20In%20this%20cohort%20study,suicide%20during%20the%20application%20process." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;only 3% of applicants younger than 24&lt;/a&gt; died by assisted suicide on a mental health basis; 47% of applications were retracted and 45% were rejected.

Looking back at her decision to get jabbed, Kelly now regrets getting the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just had my annual physical and it's still testing positive for autoimmune," the 54-year-old, told the Daily Mail, adding, "I really, really regret having gotten the vaccine," said the popular host of the Megyn Kelly Show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explaining her reasons for getting vaccinated, Kelly said she felt compelled to take the shots because vaccination proof was essential to go out during the pandemic in New York City, where she was living at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly first spoke about her autoimmune condition in her podcast - The Megyn Kelly Show, in February. While chatting with Dr. Aseem Malhotra, a British Covid vaccine skeptic, she told him that while the doctors couldn't find out what the condition was exactly, they told her it could have been caused by the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I asked the rheumatologist if it could be linked to the Pfizer vaccine and booster, and she said, ‘Yes, and you’re not the only patient I have who’s had this sequence of events," she said in her podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is post-vaccination syndrome?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly isn't the only person left with a mystery condition linked to Covid vaccine. Yale researchers found out that several other people were left with chronic symptoms months and years after getting the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the research scientists examined blood samples from 42 study participants who experienced symptoms of post-vaccination syndrome (PVS) and 22 who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with PVS had lower levels of two types of white blood cells. Additionally, people with PVS who had never contracted Covid also had lower levels of antibodies against the virus. The symptoms of PVS include excessive fatigue, exercise intolerance, brain fog, insomnia and dizziness, as per researchers. These developed within days of taking vaccine and worsened over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is Covid-19 vaccination linked to autoimmunity?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autoimmunity has been linked to Covid-19 vaccination since the beginning of the pandemic. In a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9399140/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in the Journal of Autoimmunity, six patients experienced either a relapse of a pre-existing autoimmune disease or developed a new autoimmune or autoinflammatory condition following immunization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review of 464 studies up to August 1, 2022, documented 928 such cases. The majority of affected individuals were women (53.6%) with a median age of 48 years and symptoms typically began around eight days after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New-onset autoimmune conditions were more common, accounting for 81.5% of cases, with immune thrombocytopenia, myocarditis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome being the most frequently reported. In contrast, 18.5% experienced relapses of existing conditions, most often immune thrombocytopenia, psoriasis, IgA nephropathy, and systemic lupus erythematosus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large-scale, nationwide &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50656-8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;cohort study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in Nature Communications involving over 9 million individuals in South Korea investigated the long-term association between mRNA-based Covid -19 vaccination and the development of autoimmune connective tissue diseases (AI-CTDs) over a one-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that mRNA vaccination was not associated with an increased risk for most AI-CTDs, including alopecia areata, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and vitiligo, among others. However, a modestly increased risk was observed for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), particularly in individuals who received the BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) vaccine, as well as in those with a prior Covid-19 diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'Pissed off about the whole thing'&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no question people have been hurt and even killed,' said Kelly. "I, for one, have learned a ton, but remain pissed off about how the whole thing was handled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an unfortunate thing. You can't undo the past," Kelly told Daily Mail, accepting that there have been 'worse' outcomes experienced by other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But we were lied to," she continued, adding, "It was not an informed assumption of the risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other side effects of Covid vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They include life-threatening conditions like anaphylaxis.

While in neurons, excess alpha-synuclein leads to cell death, in melanoma cells it enables uncontrolled growth by recruiting repair proteins to DNA breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dual role highlights the complex nature of alpha-synuclein and suggests new therapeutic targets for both diseases.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Developing drugs that target alpha-synuclein may be useful in both diseases,” said senior author Vivek Unni, M.D., Ph.D., an associate professor of neurology in the OHSU School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding builds on a previous discovery by Unni and colleagues published in 2019 that found alpha-synuclein helps to perform a critical function by repairing double strand breaks in the DNA of brain cells known as neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They believe this function is crucial in preventing cell death, which occurs when alpha-synuclein exits the cell’s nucleus and instead forms clumps known as Lewy bodies in Parkinson’s and Lewy body dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, conducted in melanoma cells and led by OHSU M.D./Ph.D. student Moriah Arnold, B.A., Ph.D., finds the opposite effect in respect to melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In melanoma, researchers found that alpha-synuclein does its job too well — allowing cells to proliferate uncontrollably as cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Skin cells are constantly growing and dying and being replaced. That’s normal,” Unni said. “The problem comes when the cells that should be dying don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that alpha-synuclein in melanomas don’t seem to leave the nucleus and aggregate as they do with neurons in Parkinson’s. Instead, the opposite occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They increase in the nucleus and perform their function too well within the nucleolus of each melanoma cell’s nucleus: identifying double strand breaks in DNA and then recruiting a different type of protein, known as &lt;em&gt;53BP1&lt;/em&gt;, to repair them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can lead to runaway cellular replication — cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counterintuitively, Unni said, a similar increase in alpha-synuclein leads to cellular &lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt; in Parkinson’s. Why? In neurons as opposed to skin cells, an overabundance of alpha-synuclein seems to pull them out of the cell’s nucleus into clusters forming in the cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus, Unni said. This, in turn, leads to cellular death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A neuron has to live the whole life of a person,” Unni said. “When alpha-synuclein reaches a tipping point of abundance, it can no longer perform its normal function and the neuron dies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests it may be possible to develop a drug that lowers the level of alpha-synuclein or modulates its function to treat melanoma, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, he said his research is now exploring other avenues to boost the recruitment of the binding protein &lt;em&gt;53BP1&lt;/em&gt; to replace the function of alpha-synuclein as a possible treatment for Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This provides a framework for understanding the link between (Parkinson’s disease) and melanoma, and offers potential therapeutic targets in melanoma that are focused on reducing aSyn-mediated nucleolar double strand break repair,” the authors conclude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Research was supported by the National Institute on Aging, National Institute of Neurological Disorders &amp;amp; Stroke, and National Cancer Center, of the National Institutes of Health, Awards F30AG082406, R01NS102227, P30NS061800 and P30CA065823; the Danish Cancer Society award R302-A17506; the Melanoma Research Alliance, the Michael J.

We now show that αSyn is preferentially enriched within the nucleolus in melanoma, where it colocalizes with DNA damage markers and DSBs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inducing DSBs specifically within nucleolar ribosomal DNA (rDNA) increases αSyn levels near sites of damage. αSyn knockout increases DNA damage within the nucleolus at baseline, after specific rDNA DSB induction, and prolongs the rate of recovery from this induced damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;αSyn is important downstream of ataxia-telangiectasia–mutated signaling to facilitate MDC1-mediated 53BP1 recruitment to DSBs, reducing micronuclei formation and promoting cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 12:25:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFA2S1lJZjRham9rdER2ckRvbUZiODFDNGxrWTNZTkhCUDFjN3hiRWZXNHF5YlZFVlREaC1DZ0ZDQmgxaGNOWnA4aG9OSGFxOXR0ejFkbEtQeGFsYmI2cS03UTFmTzlySWtESWc</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，儿童虐待与类风湿性关节炎和银屑病的高风险有关- PsyPost | Childhood maltreatment linked to higher risk of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, study finds - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOaktfdFdmbzVsN1BtSFd2aEk2ZGU3UmdfQ0xYLWFaSHMyR29xSTkyZTUteENtUFJ3UnJFSHlCRmk3Q2N6d1N3b1BzcXd2OHh1V0wzM2RvcXJzTWIzVjVlaVg3LVdEVWNJbzc5RHk0Ry0tdlFkczhfeGJkYWE2X28zRF8yQnd0N0ZVOVVvOTBSYlBxenJBcUFmWTg5SzFId1VSSnZkcGhxSHpVbkd3UkNhTEZiRlhwSUY1VlRz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e40493" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Heliyon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has found that people who experienced abuse, neglect, or domestic abuse during childhood have a significantly higher risk of developing certain chronic immune disorders later in life—specifically, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.

The current study sought to overcome these limitations by analyzing data from a large, representative sample using electronic health records from primary care practices in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a public health researcher and clinician, I’ve long been interested in how early life adversity shapes long-term health outcomes,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/applied-health/chandan-joht" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Joht Singh Chandan&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical professor of public health at the University of Birmingham. “Childhood maltreatment is a widespread yet under-acknowledged public health issue. We know it’s linked to mental health and cardiovascular outcomes, but its relationship with chronic immune diseases has been less explored, particularly in the UK context. This study aimed to fill that gap using robust, large-scale primary care data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the IQVIA Medical Research Database, which includes de-identified electronic health records from general practices across the United Kingdom. These records contain clinical notes, diagnoses, and other medical data, including childhood maltreatment codes recorded by general practitioners. The study period covered over two decades, from January 1995 to January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified 256,130 individuals with a documented history of childhood maltreatment before age 18 and matched them with 712,478 unexposed individuals based on age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation, and medical practice. Maltreatment was identified using a broad set of clinical codes, capturing both confirmed instances and concerns about potential abuse or neglect. Participants were followed over time to see whether they developed one of six chronic immune disorders: rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, coeliac disease, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that people exposed to childhood maltreatment had a 39% higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis and a 16% higher risk of developing psoriasis compared to those without such exposure. These associations held even after adjusting for factors such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Notably, the increased risk was more pronounced in women. For example, women who had experienced childhood maltreatment were 54% more likely to be diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, while the increase in risk for men was not statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Experiences of childhood maltreatment can have enduring effects on physical health, not just mental wellbeing,” Chandan told PsyPost. “Our findings suggest that individuals exposed to maltreatment are at increased risk of developing conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. This reinforces the need for early prevention and support, and highlights the long arm of early trauma on the immune system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the study did not find statistically significant differences in the risk of developing multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or inflammatory bowel disease. Interestingly, those exposed to childhood maltreatment were found to be at a lower risk of developing celiac disease. The reasons for this unexpected result are unclear, but researchers speculated that differences in healthcare access, disease detection, or dietary factors may play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find a lower risk of celiac disease among those exposed to childhood maltreatment,” Chandan said. “While we don’t believe maltreatment is protective, this may reflect underdiagnosis or health inequalities, where symptoms are overlooked or access to care is limited. It highlights the complex intersection of trauma, healthcare access, and disease presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also conducted several sensitivity analyses to strengthen their findings. When restricting the analysis to patients whose medical records contained direct evidence of maltreatment—as opposed to indirect concerns—the associations with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis were even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several possible explanations for the link between childhood maltreatment and these diseases. One is that early life stress may interfere with the development of the body’s stress regulation and immune systems, leading to chronic inflammation. Studies have shown that people exposed to maltreatment often have elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, which are also found in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Other behavioral factors, such as higher rates of smoking, alcohol use, and obesity among those with a history of maltreatment, may also contribute to an elevated risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its strengths, the study has important limitations. The analysis relied on medical records, which may underreport or misclassify cases of childhood maltreatment. The coding system used had high specificity but relatively low sensitivity, meaning that many cases likely went undetected. Additionally, information on potentially important confounding factors such as alcohol use, ethnicity, education, and family history was often missing or inconsistently recorded. The researchers also noted that follow-up time was shorter in the exposed group, which could affect estimates of long-term disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation concerns the outcomes themselves. Although rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis are well captured in general practice records, the recording of other immune disorders like lupus and multiple sclerosis may be less consistent, and the shorter follow-up period may not have been long enough to detect these conditions, which often develop later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study relies on clinical records, so it’s limited by how often and accurately GPs record maltreatment and IMID diagnoses,” Chandan noted. “There’s also the possibility of underreporting in both exposure and outcomes. Additionally, while we adjusted for some confounders like deprivation, there may be unmeasured factors—like family history or environmental exposures—that influence risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the study’s findings suggest that childhood maltreatment may play a more significant role in the development of certain immune-mediated conditions than previously understood. Because both childhood adversity and immune disorders are common in the population, even a modest increase in risk translates into a meaningful public health concern. The authors emphasize that early intervention and prevention efforts should not only focus on psychological outcomes but also consider the long-term physical health consequences of early life trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will be needed to explore how different types and severities of maltreatment affect disease risk, whether there is a dose-response relationship, and which biological pathways are involved. Researchers are particularly interested in whether chronic stress-induced inflammation could be a key mechanism. Expanding these investigations to other countries and healthcare systems will also help determine how generalizable the findings are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope to explore how different types, severities, and timings of childhood maltreatment influence physical health outcomes, including whether there’s a dose-response relationship,” Chandan explained. “We’re also keen to understand the biological mechanisms — particularly the role of chronic inflammation — and to inform policy around early intervention and trauma-informed care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study adds to the evidence that childhood adversity has lasting health impacts, it’s also a call to action. Preventing maltreatment and supporting survivors isn’t just a moral or legal obligation — it’s a public health priority. Integrating this knowledge into routine clinical care could help mitigate long-term harm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e40493" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The risk of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases following exposure to childhood maltreatment: A retrospective cohort study using UK primary care data&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Liam Snook, Sonica Minhas, Vrinda Nadda, Ben Hammond, Krishna M.

                Reverend Billiance Chondwe of the Somone Community Center, a branch of the Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zambia, says that many in his congregation have fallen ill since late January when cuts to U.S. aid shuttered clinics.  "We are close to 300 [worshipers] but nowadays we are only less than 150. People are sick at home."

   &lt;p&gt;From the pulpit, Reverend Billiance Chondwe counts the empty seats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We are close to 300 [worshipers] but nowadays we are only less than 150. People are sick at home," says Chondwe — or Pastor Billy as everyone calls him — as he greeted congregants on a Sunday in early April at the entrance to his church, the Somone Community Center, a branch of the Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People are falling ill because the U.S.-funded clinics where they got their HIV medications and care have suddenly been shuttered. The staff is gone. The electricity has been shut off. Some patients have already run out of their daily pills that keep HIV at bay — and they have started to feel the physical consequences of the virus surging back.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Trump Administration, in January, abruptly halted the vast majority of U.S. foreign assistance in light of their America First agenda. Officials said that &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/emergency-humanitarian-waiver-to-foreign-assistance-pause/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lifesaving aid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — such as HIV medications — would continue to flow. But the reality on the ground shows otherwise. An untold number of people with HIV have simply and suddenly lost access to their medication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60044" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                A shuttered USAID clinic in Kitwe, Zambia. The clinic provided free HIV medications and treatment to the community until it was suddenly closed in late January. People still show up at the clinic for their medicine only to find the lights out and the staff no longer there.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;That is largely because the halting of foreign assistance and cancelling of programs crippled the systems that enabled people to get their AIDS medicines. And, of the small number of programs that are technically allowed to continue, many report not being paid by the U.S. government and, thus, having to close their doors and lay off workers.  The State Department, which oversees foreign assistance, did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2024, Zambia received &lt;a href="https://foreignassistance.gov/cd/zambia/2024/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$240 million&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. to support HIV/AIDS work, including prevention, treatment and distribution of medications. NPR visited and spoke to many in this southern African nation who have expressed great frustration that the cuts to aid came with no warning and no transition plan. But they also acknowledged that their country had become dependent on foreign aid and that the government needs to do more to fill the vast gaps left by the sudden U.S. withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The main victim that is paying the price of this disruptive decision to cut the U.S. aid funding is the ordinary Zambian person living in poverty," says &lt;a href="https://uni-osnabrueck.academia.edu/ChrisZimba" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Zumani Zimba&lt;/a&gt;, a Zambian political scientist affiliated with the University of Central Africa. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/zambia/overview" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;World Bank&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, more than 60% of the population there lives in poverty. And, &lt;a href="https://zm.usembassy.gov/zambia-surpasses-unaids-hiv-treatment-and-viral-suppression-targets-and-on-track-to-surpass-hiv-status-awareness/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more than 10%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of adults in the country have HIV — half the rate of a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A study out this month in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00401-5/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Lancet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; estimated what would happen if the U.S. does not continue its flagship HIV/AIDS program that's been pivotal to reversing the downward trend in life expectancy due to AIDS. The researchers from Oxford University and elsewhere found that half a million additional children will die of AIDS in the next 5 years in sub-Saharan Africa and nearly 3 million more African children will be orphaned by AIDS. In many Zambian communities, people say these numbers will soon be more than just a forecast.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mothers and children, husbands and wives, doctors, truck drivers and religious leaders are all grappling with the fallout of the U.S. cutting aid. Here are stories of those impacted in just one part of one country: Zambia's resource-rich Copperbelt Province.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59786" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Dorcas Mwanza, 10, took the last of her HIV medications eight days ago. She's developed a fever and chills, among the first symptoms people experience when they go off HIV treatment.

When Dorcas would get home from school, she'd often play house, pretending to prepare nshima — a thick traditional porridge — for her imaginary family. "I'm thinking she'll be very family-oriented when she grows up," says Theresa in Bemba, a local language spoken in parts of Zambia. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's now been eight days since both Dorcas and her mom, Theresa, took the last of their HIV medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A single mom and an only child, they've always taken their medicine together at 8 p.m. each night. The change in routine has confused the little girl.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59948" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;"In the past week, she'll open the tin [where the medicine is kept] and find that it's empty," says Theresa. "She'll run down to the clinic to go and check if she can collect her medication. And then she'll come back home and say, 'Oh, you are right. The clinic is closed. They're not there anymore.' "&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And it seems like their U.S.-funded clinic is not coming back. The doors of the clinic, which services over 2,000 HIV patients, have been locked since the end of January, the staff let go and the furniture largely removed. This clinic didn't just provide medication, it also provided basic food since HIV medicine cannot be taken on an empty stomach. Theresa and Dorcas lost both.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So far, without their medication, Theresa feels okay. But Dorcas has developed a fever and chills — and she feels weak. Flu-like symptoms are often one of the first symptoms after someone goes off HIV treatment — the level of virus rises and the body tries to fight it off.&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;Worried, Theresa now stays home to tend to her daughter — who often rests on a mat by the tree outside their home. But it means Theresa isn't going house to house to do laundry and odd jobs, their main source of income.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60048" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Theresa tried to get their medications at a clinic run by the Zambian government. It took an hour to walk there only to get turned away. "They keep insisting: 'You need to get direction or guidance from the clinic where you were on where you will go to next,'" she recalls. But with her neighborhood clinic closed, Theresa isn't sure what to do.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She thinks back to her two sisters who died of AIDS before medication became available — and free with help from the U.S. "I am now really worried," she says looking at her daughter. "She's a very jovial little girl, but she's been very miserable the past few days."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Mayongana: Thinking about 'what will become of me'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mary Mayongana, 42, typically spends her days either at the market selling vegetables or in a small family compound she shares with her family: Her mother, her four children, her two sisters and their children.

                Mary Mayongana, 42, is unsure whether her ankle sore is a result of going off her HIV medications. She says that the pain along with the fatigue she now feels are going to make it hard to walk for 45 minutes to reach the nearest clinic after the closure of the U.S.-funded clinic she had previously used.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Now, Mary is confined to that compound. She's lost access to her HIV treatment and feels weak. She's also developed an itchy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/31/g-s1-45601/trump-pepfar-hiv-positive-antiretroviral-waiver" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rash&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a classic sign of going off HIV medications — it can be an indication that the body is trying to fight off &lt;a href="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-and-rash" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the resurgent virus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the immune system is weakening. And Mary has another challenge: her ankle is swollen from a painful open sore that continues to spread. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Without warning, her U.S.-funded clinic closed on January 28 with a stop work order from the Trump Administration. Now the clinic's health workers are distributing the remaining supply of medications among all the patients. For more than two months, Mary hasn't been able to consistently take her HIV medication. Sometimes she's gone up to 14 days with no HIV medication at all. Right now, she has a few pills and has decided to take them every third day. It's risky because her body could develop resistance to the drug if it's not taken daily. But, Mary says, it's all she has so she needs her supply to last as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59784" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;There are Zambian government clinics that still stock HIV drugs but they've been so overwhelmed by HIV patients from the shuttered U.S.-funded clinics that they've been forced to ration the medication, giving out a limited supply to each patient. And for Mary, who has no money for transportation, the government clinic seems impossibly far away. It's a 45-minute walk on a good day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She's unsure whether her ankle sore is a result of going off her HIV medications but, she says, the pain and fatigue she feels are going to make it hard to walk to the clinic. She thinks it will take her hours each way. Her mother is urging her to do it anyway — together, she says, they can take a few steps, then rest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I spend a lot of time thinking about what is likely to become of me, especially that I'm actually seeing myself wasting away," says Mary in a flat, quiet voice. She sits on the cement floor of her brick home, her head resting against the wall. "It's really weighing me down."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60045" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kabamda Willies and Alice Nyandwa: 'Volunteers that attend to us are not there'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When Kabamda Willies noticed Alice Nyandwa working in the farm fields in 2018, he immediately knew he wanted to marry her. The first thing he did was to share his HIV status. "I thought it would be wise to explain to her [that I have HIV] from the very beginning," Willies says, speaking in Bemba.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She then told him, she too is HIV positive. They soon got married.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As subsistence farmers in a very remote area, they got their medications from a community health worker who, for years, would bike to their home with their pills, delivering a six-month supply. And he could even take their blood while sitting in their thatched gazebo and then bike it back to the lab. That suddenly stopped when the U.S. surprised the world by halting the vast majority of foreign assistance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, Kabamda and Alice go to the closest government clinic to get their HIV medications and tests. It's a 3- to 4-hour walk each way. Still, they make the journey. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59789" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Farmers Alice Nyandwa and Kabamda Willies say that they now must walk three to four hours each way to a government-run HIV clinic. Even when they get to the clinic, they sometimes can't get their medications because the volunteer staff — who used to receive stipends as part of U.S. aid — aren't there anymore.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"Sometimes when we get to the clinic, the volunteers that attend to us are not there. So we need to arrange to walk back again on another day," says Kabamda, 63. Those volunteers are missing because many of them had received a stipend from the U.S. — and that's now dried up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even if the clinic is open and the couple can get served, there's another problem: The days when they'd get enough pills to last 6 months are gone. Now, Zambian government clinics are rationing HIV drugs. The state clinics didn't have warning about the U.S. cutting aid and didn't stock up on medications. So, with the onslaught of new patients, Kabamda and Alice say, they are being given medication for just two weeks. Kabamda says it's hard to find the time to return to the clinic so regularly because "we need to grow our food to eat."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oswell Sindaza: 'I'm moving like a headless chicken'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When Oswell Sindaza was born, the story goes, his mother looked him over — head to toe — and enthusiastically said: "All is well." And so, that became his name: Oswell.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But these days, such a happy declaration is sorely missing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59790" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                "We have over 6,400 [HIV] clients, and I'm just alone as a clinical person," says Oswell Sindaza, a doctor who used to oversee a staff of 21 nurses, doctors, pharmacists and lab technicians that was funded by U.S. foreign assistance.

   &lt;p&gt;Sindaza, who's 44, is a doctor for HIV/AIDS patients. Since 2014, he's been running a project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development which was housed within the Wusakile Mine Hospital. Sindaza used to oversee a staff of 21, including a team of nurses, doctors, pharmacists and lab technicians. The local mining company paid his salary and so, unlike his colleagues,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;whose salaries were directly or indirectly paid by U.S. foreign aid,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;he survived the funding cuts. But now, he's the only doctor left. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We have over 6,400 [HIV] clients, and I'm just alone as a clinical person," says Oswell, adding that there's also one accountant and one nurse who were not funded by U.S. aid. His caseload grows each day as patients, desperate for HIV medications, arrive from nearby clinics that have been closed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We just give them drugs. We're not taking care of the clients' needs, things like viral load testing, liver function tests, kidney function. We do not have the capacity to do that," he says. "I'm moving like a headless chicken now just to try and make things happen."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says he worries about all the patients who can't make it to his clinic — those who live too far away or are in wheelchairs. He knows they have no medication, and he doesn't know how to help. He says he feels like he's failing his patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's really, really draining me," Oswell says. "I feel maybe I will not manage to cope going forward."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59800" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

He's a house painter and — with the help of HIV medication, which he's taken for 15 years — he always had the strength to do his work. But no longer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I feel weakness — weak, weak, weak," he says as his voice cracks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since early February, when his local U.S.-funded clinic shut down, he's struggled to get his medication. At first, he managed to obtain a few pills here and there but, now, he's out entirely.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sitting on a wooden bench by the window with one of his three children nearby, he says he's lost a lot of weight and feels like all the power has been drained out of him.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59783" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Brian's wife also has HIV and has run out of her medication, too. But, so far, she says she feels fine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The couple went to a nearby government clinic hoping they would be able to get their medications refilled. But, they say, they were told they must bring their medical records in order to register as new patients. So they've been going back to their old clinic to get their files. Every time they go, it's still shuttered. And yet, he says, they have no choice but to keep trying.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We need to wait until there's someone at the &lt;a href="https://www.usaid.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;USAID&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; facility," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Zambian Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment on this policy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brian worries that by the time he gets his medical record and registers at a new clinic, it will be too late. "I'm going to lose my life, and I will leave my children suffering," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59798" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

Truck drivers are calling him. "They are crying," he says. "'We've got no [HIV] medicine. Where do you get [it] from?'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He has no good answer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For 15 years, Geoffrey — who is now 54 — has been working with HIV-positive truck drivers and sex workers who hang out around truck stops. After his own brother died of AIDS, Geoffrey left his job as a miner, saying to himself, " 'Let me teach others not to get [HIV].'

   &lt;p&gt;As a community health worker, he would periodically pick up a big bag of HIV treatments from a mobile clinic. Then, he'd coordinate with over 200 truck drivers — and even more sex workers. Calling and texting them, he'd figure out when they'd be passing through the border crossing and go meet them to give them their medications and make sure they had all the information they needed about how not to spread HIV.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The dusty parking lots where Geoffrey spent his days are lined with 18-wheelers, many loaded down with freshly-mined minerals. They pause here — at the border between Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, near the town of Chililabombwe — sometimes for days, waiting for permission to cross the border.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's this type of location that public health experts have zeroed in on as critical in halting the spread of HIV. In the early days of the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, the virus fanned out along trucking routes as long-haul drivers frequented sex workers. Still today in Zambia, HIV is a particular challenge along the trucking routes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59797" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Long-haul truckers sometimes pause for days at this truck stop near the Zambian town of Chililabombwe as they await approval to cross the border into the Democratic Republic of Congo. Distributing HIV medicine on trucking routes is critical to stopping the spread of HIV, say public health experts.

   &lt;p&gt;Now, with U.S. aid slashed the special effort to prevent and contain the virus in these hot spots has stopped, Geoffrey says. He no longer has the medications to distribute. He no longer has his income — and, he says, he's struggling to pay for food. But, he still picks up the continuous string of calls from truck drivers and sex workers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Geoffrey estimates that about 20 of the 200 truck drivers he worked with have called and told him they're starting to fall ill without their HIV medications. He says one of his drivers died in Congo. In the arcades and bars that line the main street, Geoffrey has heard it was because the driver didn't have his HIV medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He died in Congo. [And] bringing the body [back to Zambia], it's very expensive," says long-haul truck driver Roi Silunyange, 54, who also knew the deceased man.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60043" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Zambian trucker Roi Silunyange, 54, stands in a parking lot at a truck stop near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. He says that he knows a fellow truck driver who died while in Congo because he ran out of HIV medication.

   &lt;p&gt;Mwape Shamboko, another driver who is 42 and standing nearby, used to rely on health workers like Geoffrey and the U.S.-funded system to get his HIV medications.

   &lt;p&gt;"If you're not feeling well, or you need a supply — maybe your medicines have run out — [we] would call that number, and [the community health workers] were always very quick at coming to us and responding to our needs," Mwape says. "So it was a very, very good system. We were not missing our medications."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Now, he says, the calls go unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daliso Tembo and Mary Tembo: 'We can't find peace at night'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sleep is hard to come by in the Tembo household.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Daliso, 49, and Mary, 32, are farmers, growing peanuts and other crops together. When night falls, they are wracked with worry about the future.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He's HIV-positive and, since his U.S.-funded clinic suddenly closed two months ago, his medications are running low. Just 20 days of pills left. She's managed to avoid contracting HIV from her husband by taking a drug from the clinic, known as PrEP, that prevents the transmission of HIV. But now, all of that is in question.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59792" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;"We can't find peace at night. Sleep has escaped us," says Mary. "We're asking ourselves: What next? What if? He doesn't like to have these conversations, but it's important that we have them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mary plays out the worst case scenario in her mind: "If [Daliso] can't access his drugs — and let's say he falls ill and he dies — what then happens to us as a household? Because he's the head of our household. He takes care of us," she says. "And, if anything happens to me — if I find myself [HIV] positive…" Her voice trails off.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Their main concern is about their five children. The youngest is 2 years old and doesn't understand what's happening. But the older ones are worried.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They're always coming to me to say, 'Give us answers.' I always tell them, 'Let's not have this conversation,'" says Mary. "I know it's not the right thing, but I'm really trying to avoid it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Daliso and Mary went to a nearby government clinic but were told to come back later when Daliso would have only a few days of HIV pills left. Mary says that clinic is so overburdened by all the HIV patients who lost treatment when the U.S. cut aid, she's afraid they won't have any medications left for her husband.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This change has really devastated me," Daliso says, his voice filled with emotion. "I'm a man, but what it has done, it has really shattered me."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59794-1" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Catherine Mwaloe, 16, who contracted HIV from her mother at birth, has one month's supply of HIV medicine left. She worries that government clinics will charge money for the medications, which were previously free.

   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catherine Mwaloe: 'What is it that I have done to get this illness?'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When times are hard, Catherine Mwaloe turns to music. She pulls out her phone and scrolls to the emotional, religious songs. Lately, the 16-year-old has been listening to a lot of these songs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;From the two-room house — under a huge mango tree — that she shares with her grandmother, Catherine lets the lyrics of her favorite song, "Nessa's Holy Spirit," wash over her:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Jesus I need you to survive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh come oh! Holy Spirit come oh" &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her grandmother, who has the same name, says Catherine has been grappling with two questions for which there are no good answers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She began to ask why she's taking this medication, and then I had to explain to her that 'You're HIV positive,' " says Catherine's grandmother. The girl got the virus from her mother at birth but, her grandmother says, "it's been very difficult to get her to accept her situation. She says, 'What is it that I have done to get this illness?' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Holy Spirit come,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come and have your way"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lately Catherine's question of "why" has been superseded by the question of "how." How will she get her next round of HIV medications when the health center where she got her free HIV medications was funded by the U.S. and has now shut down. She has one month's supply left and she worries that all the government clinics will charge money for the medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59793" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

"I've heard that there are many millions of people going to die."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As Catherine listens to her music, she says, her dream of becoming a surgeon one day feels as if it'll never come true.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Come and do your thing,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come and be the strength when [I] am weak" &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59787" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverend Billiance Chondwe: Bringing back memories of his twin's death from AIDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As a child, Billiance Chondwe did everything with his twin sister, Charity. They insisted on just one shared dinner plate. They requested coordinated clothes. He played jump rope with her, ignoring the taunts of neighborhood children for playing a girl's game.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then — in the late 1990s — when they were 17, Charity got AIDS. Billy nursed her month after month. If he left the house, she would call out for him. He missed school to tend to her. When she died almost a year later, the grief was overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What I felt was: I'm alone," recalls Billy, who is now 52. "It brought me to my knees. It brought me to a point where, no matter what I can do as a human being, there is a limit."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For years, he couldn't shake the smell of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then, in 2004, things started to change. There was a big push by the U.S. government to get HIV medication to Zambia, along with dozens of other countries. Since then, the U.S. has poured nearly $7 billion into controlling the HIV epidemic in Zambia, providing free HIV medications for 1.2 million Zambians.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Billy, it felt like a weight was lifted. "Despair was taken away," he says. "Children had hope they will grow [up] with their father."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And then, earlier this year, came the sudden pullout of U.S. aid. Overnight, clinics were locked and shutters were bolted shut. All the doctors, nurses, community health workers and volunteers were told to stop working immediately. Patients lost access to their files — and, most important, their medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60049" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Reverend Billy is haunted by the memory of people dying during the height of the AIDS crisis in the 1990s. The recent pullout of U.S. foreign aid has brought back feelings of hopelessness and despair.&lt;br&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Now — at Billy's branch of the Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zambia — he watches his congregation shrink as parishioners stay home, sick or tending to the sick who can't find another source of HIV medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Yesterday, I received three calls: Two of my members — they are admitted in the hospital. And I received another [call] from a couple — they are sick," says Pastor Billy. The hopelessness he felt during the years when there was no treatment for AIDS has returned. "It haunts me," he says.&lt;/p&gt;

The bigger issue is that at my hourly rate of pay, the longer I spent writing in that chamber, the further I’d fall behind financially, adding stress I’d need to pay a practitioner to relieve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I’d love to say “live and let follow every trend; even in the absence of observable results or peer-reviewed studies; and even if you don’t have the condition the remedy was designed to treat; or the small print talks about potentially serious side effects!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But health, or at least appearing healthy, is a zero-sum game. If there’s even a chance that any of these things work (my close friend is having &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62842630/testosterone-missing-piece-menopause/" target="_blank"&gt;testosterone applied to her buttocks, &lt;/a&gt;and my tush remains gel-free) — even if my testosterone levels are just fine — I’m obviously going to be more susceptible to mood swings and muscle weakness. My libido will grow weak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Maybe we should do an IV drip,” suggested a friend (not the testosterone one; I’m ghosting her out of self-preservation).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;I looked down to see if I was wearing a hospital gown, but then I remembered the IV vitamin drips are no longer for the sick. They’re for the healthy — hungover or jet-lagged though they may be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But IV drips can run you hundreds of dollars, and that seemed like a lot when we weren’t feeling vitamin deficient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“How about we step into a cryotherapy chamber and freeze ourselves for 90 seconds for $25,” I said, having learned about such a deal in the suburbs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Why?” she asked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/popmedicine/celebritydiagnosis/85109" target="_blank"&gt;Because Justin Bieber&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/popmedicine/celebritydiagnosis/85109" target="_blank"&gt;does,&lt;/a&gt;” I explained rationally. “And it might help with &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cryotherapy-benefits#benefits" target="_blank"&gt;mood disorders.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She’s in her 60s, and said that while it’s true she suffers from anxiety, it’s because she’s already fallen so far behind wrinkle- and tooth-color-wise “that I’ll never catch up.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As for me, I miss the old days of the anti-aging Olympics, where all you needed was: a facelift, Botox,&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/specials/thehelpdesk/2018/07/24/how-look-years-younger/4b2ZgEirjRs0keFeR8E6eK/story.html" target="_blank"&gt; teeth whitening&lt;/a&gt;, a bust and rear-end lift, and monthly salon sessions to cover the gray.

CWD was reported in Putnam, Marshall, Adams, and Peoria counties, expanding the geographic presence of the disease in free-ranging deer populations in northern Illinois, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams County is the first documented case recorded outside of the leading edge of the CWD endemic region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CWD is an always-fatal neurological disease that affects the long-term health of white-tailed deer in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CWD was first documented in Illinois in 2002 near Roscoe. It has since been detected in 25 counties across northern Illinois and now as far south as Adams County in west-central Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early February 2025, CWD was detected and confirmed through diagnostic testing in Putnam, Marshall, and Adams counties from routine surveillance of hunter-harvested deer. Peoria County was confirmed in a 2-year-old deer exhibiting clinical signs consistent with CWD infection using the same diagnostic testing procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samples from Adams County underwent genetic testing to ensure genetic matches between submitted tissue samples and source deer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affected Illinois counties now include Adams, Boone, Bureau, Carroll, Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Ford, Grundy, Jo Daviess, Kane, Kankakee, Kendall, Lake, LaSalle, Lee, Livingston, Marshall, McHenry, Ogle, Peoria, Putnam, Stephenson, Will, and Winnebago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Illinois is a national leader in managing and slowing the spread of CWD, and over the past two decades IDNR’s program has served as a model for other states,” said IDNR Director Natalie Phelps Finnie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization and the &lt;a href="https://dnr.illinois.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; and Prevention have not linked CWD to human transmission. However, they recommend against eating meat from CWD-positive deer. Hunters are encouraged to have their deer tested and avoid consuming brain, spinal cord, eyes, and other tissues known to harbor the CWD agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copyright 2025 WAND TV.

&lt;p&gt;“Get the flu shot and you are 27% more likely to get the flu!” read an April 7 X post that referenced a preprint study published on April 4. “GET THE SHOT GET THE DISEASE!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 3 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 1 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 2 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 3 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, another X post trumpeted news of the study with a call for action: “All flu ‘vaccines’ must be pulled from the market pending large prospective studies of their safety and effectiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warnings cite a non-peer-reviewed article by Cleveland Clinic researchers titled Effectiveness of the Influenza Vaccine During the 2024-2025 Respiratory Viral Season. It was posted on April 4 on the preprint server medRxiv, which discloses in bold typeface at the top that it “reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-the-study-says-and-what-it-does-not"&gt;What the study says – and what it does not&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved 53,402 Cleveland Clinic Health System employees in Ohio and found that its vaccinated participants had a higher incidence of infection in the most recent flu season. But a Cleveland Clinic spokesperson said it’s misleading to use the study to draw broader conclusions about vaccines and susceptibility to infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The data came from a relatively healthy population of about 50,000 healthcare workers and did not represent the general population,” Cleveland Clinic spokesperson Andrea Pacetti said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flu vaccine helps prevent flu cases from getting more severe and requiring hospitalisation. Every year, the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee decides which viruses to use for the upcoming season’s flu vaccine. Data collected by the FDA, World Health Organization, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other partners on which flu strains are circulating around the world inform that committee’s decision. (The committee’s meeting to discuss influenza vaccine strains for the 2025-2026 influenza season was cancelled.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, during seasons when the flu vaccine strains and the circulating flu strains match, the vaccine “has been shown to reduce the risk of having to go to the doctor with flu by 40% to 60%”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert H Hopkins Jr, the medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said the Cleveland Clinic study does not evaluate the primary benefit for getting vaccinated against influenza: reducing one’s risk for severe illness, hospitalisation and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People should be aware that the effectiveness of flu vaccines vary from year to year, but even when flu vaccination does not prevent infection completely, it can make the illness milder and prevent serious complications, including hospitalisation and death,” Hopkins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopkins said he “completely” disagrees with the social media post calling for flu vaccines’ removal from the market. “That action would result in more &lt;a href="/news/2025/3/3/rfk-jr-noted-vaccine-sceptic-backs-measles-jab-amid-deadly-us-outbreak"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; and death from flu,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nabin Shrestha, a physician and coauthor of the study, said although the results found an increased risk of influenza among vaccinated participants, the authors understood that the increased risk “could have been from an unrecognised factor” and, therefore, did not conclude that the vaccine increases infection risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shrestha also said the study did not suggest that the influenza vaccine should be pulled from the market because it makes people more likely to get the flu. “Overall, the flu vaccine is an important public health tool,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who participated in the study? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleveland Clinic requires workers to get the annual flu vaccine or seek a medical- or religion-based exemption, so this study involved a high number of vaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the participants, 43,857 were vaccinated during the study period with 98.7 percent receiving the inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine. By the study’s end, 1,079 participants had gotten the flu – roughly 2 percent of the entire study population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacetti said it was notable that only 2 percent of the participants contracted influenza during the study period. “The population did not include children and contained very few elderly or immunocompromised individuals,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s results indicated the cumulative incidence of influenza – or the number of new cases divided by the total number of people in the study at risk (vaccinated and not vaccinated) – increased faster among the vaccinated participants than the unvaccinated ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that the influenza vaccine had a negative effectiveness, “suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza” for that season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do these findings mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flu vaccine effectiveness can vary per season and per person (factoring in characteristics such as age and health), the CDC said. Their effectiveness also depends on their similarity to the influenza viruses circulating in the community, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from the agency showed seasonal flu vaccine effectiveness – or how well the vaccine prevents severe illness and hospitalisation – changes per season with a 42 percent effectiveness rate during the 2023-2024 season. Researchers found it reduced the risk for flu-related outpatient visits and hospitalisations among children, adolescents and adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopkins said the study did not discuss if the workplace had masking policies or other restrictions for unvaccinated employees, which “could have an important impact on the incidence of influenza”, especially for those working in clinical settings. About 10,900 participants had a clinical nursing job, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacetti and Jeffrey Morris, biostatistics director at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, also said the vaccines primarily reduce the risk of death or severe disease, which the study does not address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article said the vaccine’s effectiveness in any given year “depends on how similar the strains contained in the vaccine are to the strains causing infection that year”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors also said because nearly all of its participants used the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, it’s possible that other influenza vaccines may have been more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

Diet, particularly the increase in consumption of ultra-processed foods, is believed to be a major contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prof Stebbing remarked: "As a consultant oncologist, many people have asked me how their risk can be reduced."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;section data-embed-group="read-more" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt; &lt;aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;p&gt;He continued, explaining the potential benefits of a specific dietary habit: "The emerging evidence suggests that regular yoghurt consumption may have a protective effect against certain aggressive forms of colorectal cancer by modifying the gut microbiome, the natural bacteria that live in the gut.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="35051767" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in overall health, influencing digestion, immune function and even cancer risk."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He further elaborated on the importance of gut health, stating: "The gut bacteria can live inside cancer itself, and in general a healthy balance of these bacteria is thought to be essential for maintaining a strong immune system and preventing inflammation, which can contribute to cancer development."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prof Stebbing believes yoghurt might be a key player in cancer prevention due to its live cultures of beneficial bacteria, like lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus, which are known to help maintain a healthy balance in the gut.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He explained: "The study found that consuming two or more servings of yoghurt per week was associated with a lower risk of a specific type of aggressive colorectal cancer, which occurs on the right side of the colon and is associated with poorer survival outcomes compared with cancers on the left side."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research involved a large-scale analysis of 150,000 individuals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spanning several decades, the study tracked over 150,000 participants, suggesting that consistent yoghurt consumption could positively influence the gut microbiome, offering protection against certain types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every two years, researchers checked in with the participants regarding their yoghurt consumption and also examined the presence of Bifidobacterium (a bacteria commonly found in yoghurt) in the tumour tissues of 3,079 individuals from the group who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although yoghurt consumption didn't reduce the risk for all forms of colorectal cancer, those who regularly ate two or more servings each week showed a decreased risk of developing "Bifidobacterium-positive proximal colon cancer", a particularly aggressive form of cancer located in the right side of the colon, notorious for its low survival rates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nutrition expert Prof Tim Spector, the brains behind the Zoe app, has shared his daily habit of indulging in yoghurt, touting its benefits for maintaining a robust gut microbiome that aids digestion and bolsters the immune system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tim revealed: "For yoghurts I never go for fat-free products. I don't like the taste of them and they're not good for my sugar spikes either."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also noted in the clip's caption: "By choosing fat containing yoghurts I feel fuller for longer and I also prefer the taste."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He highlights that yoghurt is loaded with calcium, making it great for bone health and warding off osteoporosis. Consistent consumption of yoghurt has been linked to lower blood pressure and a diminished risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emerging research even suggests that yoghurt might help fend off type 2 diabetes and other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With close to 45,000 new bowel cancer diagnoses yearly in the UK, it ranks as the fourth most prevalent cancer in the nation and third worldwide. However, many cases are preventable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cancer Research UK data indicates that up to 54% of bowel cancers could be avoided with healthier living. Smoking, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol use, processed meats, and an unhealthy diet count among the key contributors to developing bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Irish Star</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 11:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOSG9BM2huWEhXUFJEUlpYT3kxMmxKRzJpajZPYnhFTXplRUJRcEpNX3hBV1dEa3l3THY4a2Jic0lHTGp2QXhJRWNrVTZ6MUVLclZWZ3JhUWFBT1ZreG1WTWdYWHYtbVZuQ3RSOHhObjI1SkV6WElsYm5XdDJIdktaUWVIcjdFZVVyT2800gGQAUFVX3lxTE1vTTRpcWtONnFpOW9Ra29Vb25rM2RpV2lQcWZMOUdzS0tlR3NuZ0lYbkF3clJmZXI2V3Nta2VRMHpQbFBVSXZRdTIzQnZOYXdoOWJWcUpHdENOWG41cFNlaGg4Vm9nTGl5NzVCZjNJeE5hR0tEdGFoLVp0Tl9wUTBNaGQxaGREd2FuVVJoNUpYbw</guid></item><item><title>“空气饥饿”是我们谈论得不够多的焦虑症状- HuffPost | ‘Air Hunger’ Is A Symptom Of Anxiety We Don’t Talk About Nearly Enough - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOWDRGOHloNDFJeUZjMjU0Ti1haEVaeDdXeno2ZUpCbllQeHZtTzF5M2JQNXl2Z0pEMF9BNDdhVnpLT19xVlNzTWJqX0xXUjQycllxdnFIWGtrSjJnQnp0UEFsZUQyajR2U3FpcDVnVEdqdHpyd0NiLWQtNTFnM3dKTHZR0gGHAUFVX3lxTE1RR3QxeF9aWVFpb2xjUTVLVl8wbUdCMkZjRkNNOHA1LXliQ0ZEeHh3MEtZcGNfOHJVQmctYlZrM0h6ejZkM1B3YVBiaHVLaEpqU3prdTFoWVBSMTBuUFdhTHFBYVg1YzQ2VW1CamY1Q0RGVHJ1ajhDLURyVkprazNvMlVOQ3ltOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.seeleylutz.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Seeley Lutz" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67cf30cde4b04cf586ccdfd1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.seeleylutz.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Seeley Lutz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a 26-year-old from Alexandria, Virginia, feels overwhelmed — either in a social situation or by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/1-3-5-rule-to-do-list-productivity_l_679195fae4b06448cdc84fcb" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="all she has to get done" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67cf30cde4b04cf586ccdfd1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="679195fae4b06448cdc84fcb" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;all she has to get done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; — she said she feels like her body starts to shut down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often feel like there’s something heavy &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chest-pain-heart-signs-symptoms_l_6283e7aee4b003ed29678afa" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="sitting atop my chest" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67cf30cde4b04cf586ccdfd1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="6283e7aee4b003ed29678afa" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;sitting atop my chest&lt;/a&gt; or blocking my airways, leaving me unable to breathe,” Lutz said. “It truly feels like you’re suffocating even when there’s plenty of oxygen available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What she’s experiencing — and what many people experience — is called “air hunger.” John Scott Haldane and James Lorrain Smith coined the term in a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/path.1700010205" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="1892 paper" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67cf30cde4b04cf586ccdfd1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/path.1700010205" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;1892 paper&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s a common symptom of anxiety, although people rarely talk about how it feels ― or even know that it has a name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, air hunger is the feeling that you can’t get enough air. From a medical standpoint, it’s referred to as dyspnea. When anxiety causes it, it’s tied to the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/signs-fight-or-flight-mode_l_649307a2e4b06123d83171b4" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="“fight or flight” response" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67cf30cde4b04cf586ccdfd1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="649307a2e4b06123d83171b4" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;“fight or flight” response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When we perceive a threat, whether real or imagined, the brain signals the body to enter fight-or-flight mode,” explained &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://turningtidespsychology.co.uk/about-us/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Gayle Watts" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67cf30cde4b04cf586ccdfd1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://turningtidespsychology.co.uk/about-us/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gayle Watts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a clinical psychologist with Turning Tides Psychology. “This activates the sympathetic nervous system, which increases heart rate, tenses muscles and alters breathing patterns.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the body, a threat isn’t always as primal or life-threatening as being chased by a bear. It can also be giving a presentation, experiencing a trauma trigger or anything in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When your sympathetic nervous system is activated, you may hyperventilate or breathe too quickly or shallowly. That’s where the feeling like you can’t get enough air comes in. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And unfortunately, what may feel instinctual can make matters worse. “Paradoxically, the more we focus on our breathing and try to ‘fix’ it, the more we reinforce the cycle of anxiety and air hunger,” Watts added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anxiety and air hunger can become cyclical: You feel anxious, so you experience air hunger, and then struggling to breathe triggers more anxiety.

            In the past six months, two babies in Louisiana have died of pertussis, the disease commonly known as whooping cough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sl000b3b6ooap27dv3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Washington state recently announced its first confirmed death from pertussis in more than a decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sl000c3b6ouxv4tpwi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Idaho and South Dakota each reported a death this year, and Oregon last year reported two as well as its highest number of cases since 1950.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cm9d4d6of009a3b6ot916aizn@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            While much of the country is focused on the spiraling measles outbreak concentrated in the small, dusty towns of West Texas, cases of pertussis have skyrocketed by more than 1,500% nationwide since hitting a recent low in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Deaths tied to the disease are also up, hitting 10 last year, compared with about two to four in previous years. Cases are on track to exceed that total this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o06s00093b6ogu8tyzg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors, researchers and public health experts warn that the measles outbreak, which has grown to more than 600 cases, may just be the beginning. They say outbreaks of preventable diseases could get much worse with falling vaccination rates and the Trump administration slashing spending on the country’s public health infrastructure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000h3b6oxzosf3n5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            National rates for four major vaccines, which had held relatively steady in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic, have fallen significantly since, according to a ProPublica analysis of the most recent federal kindergarten vaccination data. Not only have vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella fallen, but federal data shows that so have those for pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and polio.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000i3b6oc6jfohfr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, public health experts say that growing pockets of unvaccinated populations across the country place babies and young children in danger should there be a resurgence of these diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000l3b6o1gtzq3f6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many medical authorities view measles, which is especially contagious, as the canary in the coal mine, but pertussis cases may also be a warning, albeit one that has attracted far less attention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000m3b6o3qsr24nm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is not just measles,” said Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor in New York City and author of the book “Booster Shots: The Urgent Lessons of Measles and the Uncertain Future of Children’s Health.” “It’s a bright-red warning light.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000n3b6oui3ipol7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least 36 states have witnessed a drop in rates for at least one key vaccine from the 2013-14 to the 2023-24 school years. And half of states have seen an across-the-board decline in all four vaccination rates. Wisconsin, Utah and Alaska have experienced some of the most precipitous drops during that time, with declines of more than 10 percentage points in some cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000o3b6oume8rc45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is a direct correlation between vaccination rates and vaccine-preventable disease outbreak rates,” said a spokesperson for the Utah Department of Health and Human Services. “Decreases in vaccination rates will likely lead to more outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in Utah.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d412u200913b6our7c62bb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But statewide figures alone don’t provide a full picture. Tucked inside each state are counties and communities with far lower vaccination rates that drive outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003t3b6oui1qjj53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, the whooping cough vaccination rate for kindergartners in Washington state in 2023-24 was 90.2%, slightly below the U.S. rate of 92.3%, federal data shows. But the statewide rate for children 19 to 35 months last year was 65.4%, according to state data. In four counties, that rate was in the 30% range. In one county, it was below 12%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003u3b6o1b1drajs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My concern is that there is going to be a large outbreak of not just measles, but other vaccine-preventable diseases as well, that’s going to end up causing a lot of harm, and possibly deaths in children and young adults,” said Dr. Anna Durbin, a professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who has spent her career studying vaccines. “And it’s completely preventable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003v3b6ox7b4almd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The dramatic cuts to public health funding and staffing could heighten the risk. And the elevation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, to the secretary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, several experts said, has only compounded matters.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003w3b6ois9xqhhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Trump administration has eliminated 20,000 jobs at agencies within HHS, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nation’s public health agency. And late last month, the administration also cut $11 billion from state and local public health agencies on the front lines of protecting Americans from outbreaks; the administration said the money was no longer necessary after the end of the pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003x3b6oiunra599@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Several city and county public health officials had to move quickly to lay off nurses, epidemiologists and disease inspectors. Some ceased vaccination clinics, halted wastewater surveillance programs and even terminated a contract with the courier service that transports specimens to state labs to test for infectious diseases. One Minnesota public health agency, which had provided 1,400 shots for children at clinics last year, immediately stopped those clinics when the directive arrived, court records show.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003y3b6oo3lv2syh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A federal judge temporarily barred HHS from enacting the cuts, but the ruling, which came more than a week after the grants were terminated, was too late for programs that had already been canceled and employees who had already been laid off. Lawyers for HHS have asked the judge to reconsider her decision in light of a recent Supreme Court ruling that allowed the Department of Education to terminate grants for teacher training while that case is being argued in lower courts. The judge in the HHS case has not yet ruled on the motion.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003z3b6o8wgdkjov@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in tiny storefronts and cozy homes, at school fairs and gas stations, many residents in West Texas, near where the measles outbreak has taken hold, appear unfazed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00403b6o28docmo2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t need a vaccine,” one man sitting on his porch said recently. “I don’t get sick.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00413b6o24l8d6aa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s measles. It’s been around forever,” said a woman making her way to her car. “I don’t think it’s a big deal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00423b6orrcgbvdj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When asked why they weren’t planning on vaccinating their baby, a husband walking alongside his wife who was 27 weeks pregnant simply said, “It’s God’s will.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d41jxi00943b6oceg4eb66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In word and deed, Kennedy has sown doubt about immunizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00443b6o2116cjsl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In response to the measles outbreak, Kennedy initially said in a column he wrote for Fox News that the decision to vaccinate is a “personal one.” HHS sent doses of vitamin A alongside vaccines to Texas, and Kennedy praised the use of cod liver oil. Only the vaccine prevents measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00453b6oikgs4ecd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About a week later, in an interview on Fox News, while Kennedy encouraged vaccines, he said he was a “freedom of choice person.” At the same time, he emphasized the risks of the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00463b6oqpsd77zy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Only after the second measles death in Texas did &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy post&lt;/a&gt; on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00473b6o7k74r7mt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But even that is not the unequivocal message that the head of HHS should be sending, said Ratner, the infectious diseases doctor in New York. It is, he said, a tepid recommendation at best.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00483b6orkb3o5mi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It gives the impression that these things are equivalent, that you can choose one or the other, and that is disingenuous,” he said. “We don’t have a treatment for measles. We have vitamin A, which we can give to kids with measles, that decreases but doesn’t eliminate the risk of severe outcomes. It doesn’t do anything for prevention of measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00493b6oqyol1duz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the past, Kennedy has been a fierce critic of the vaccine. In a foreword to a 2021 book on measles released by the nonprofit that he founded, Kennedy wrote, “Measles outbreaks have been fabricated to create fear that in turn forces government officials to ‘do something.’ They then inflict unnecessary and risky vaccines on millions of children for the sole purpose of fattening industry profits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004a3b6o1qw1ipve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson for HHS said, “Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine — he is pro-safety, pro-transparency and pro-accountability.” Kennedy, the spokesperson said, responded to the measles outbreak with “clear guidance that vaccines are the most effective way to prevent measles” and under his leadership, the CDC updated its pediatric patient management protocol for measles to include physician-administered vitamin A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004b3b6ojnblk0gx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, the spokesperson added, “is uniquely qualified to lead HHS at this pivotal moment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004c3b6ozfl95v7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Late last month, leaders at the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/measles-vaccine-rfk-cdc-report" target="_blank"&gt;ordered staff to bury a risk assessment&lt;/a&gt; that emphasized the need for vaccines in response to the measles outbreak — in spite of the fact the CDC has long &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html" target="_blank"&gt;promoted vaccinations&lt;/a&gt; as a cornerstone of public health. While a CDC spokesperson acknowledged that vaccines offer the best protection from measles, she also repeated a line Kennedy had used: “The decision to vaccinate is a personal one.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004d3b6o5h2nf56i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the approximately 2,400 jobs eliminated at the CDC was a team in the Immunization Services Division that partnered with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-equity/php/about/partnering-for-vaccine-equity-partners.html" target="_blank"&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt; to promote access to and confidence in vaccines in communities where coverage lagged.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004e3b6o0s1lr9d5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The National Institutes of Health, which is also under HHS, recently ended funding for studies that examine vaccine hesitancy. In early April, researchers, the American Public Health Association and one of the largest unions in the country sued the NIH and its director, Jay Bhattacharya, along with HHS and Kennedy, alleging they terminated grants “without scientifically-valid explanation or cause.” The government hasn’t filed a response in the case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004f3b6oy2nxc4w2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The NIH cancellation notices stated that the agency’s policy was not to prioritize research that focuses on “gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004g3b6o83v3iigh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These grants are being canceled in the midst of an outbreak, a vaccine-preventable outbreak,” said Rupali Limaye, an associate professor at George Mason University who has spent the past decade studying vaccine hesitancy. “We need to better understand why people are not accepting vaccines now more than ever. This outbreak is still spreading.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004h3b6oa70j5ggw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That vaccines prevent diseases is settled science. For decades, there was a societal understanding that getting vaccinated benefited not only the person who got the shot, but also the broader community, especially babies or people with weakened immune systems, like those in chemotherapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004i3b6onzafa7c7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An investment in public health and a sustained, large-scale approach to vaccines is what helped the country declare the elimination of the measles in 2000, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, the CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004j3b6o4fsr40cl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But she has watched both deteriorate over the last few months. Nearly every morning since notices of the federal funding cuts began going out to local public health agencies, she has woken up to texts from panicked public health workers. She has led daily calls with local health departments and sat in on multiple emergency board meetings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004k3b6o7vafb83w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Freeman has compiled a list of more than 100 direct consequences of the cuts, including one rural health department in the Midwest that can no longer carry out immunization services. That’s vital because there are no hospitals in the county and all public health duties fall to the health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004l3b6o4eo1g15e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s relentless,” she said. “It feels like a barrage and assault on public health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004m3b6obcf2ywx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 1,600 miles away from Washington, D.C., in Lubbock, Texas, the director of the city’s health department, Katherine Wells, sighed last week when she saw the most recent measles numbers. She would have to alert her staff to work late again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004n3b6ofamj15c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s a lot of cases,” she said, “and we continue to see more and more cases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004o3b6oirt2j4ug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She didn’t know it at the time, but that night would mark the state’s second measles death this year. An earlier death in February was the country’s first in a decade. Both children were not vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004p3b6orw5icw9w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy said he traveled to Gaines County to comfort the family who lost their 8-year-old daughter and while there met with the family of the 6-year-old girl who died in February.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004q3b6o7j739b4p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also visited with two local doctors he described as “extraordinary healers,” he said in his post on X. The men, he claimed, have “treated and healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children” using aerosolized budesonide — typically used to prevent symptoms of asthma — and clarithromycin — an antibiotic. Medical experts said neither is an effective measles treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004r3b6o1unee47i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            State health officials have traced about two-thirds of the measles cases in Texas to Gaines County, which sits on the western edge of the state.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004s3b6ooulh4kus@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seminole, one of the county’s only two incorporated towns, has emerged as the epicenter of the outbreak, with Tina Siemens acting as a community ambassador of sorts.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004t3b6ohfm8q2b7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Siemens, a tall woman with glasses and a short blonde bob, runs a museum that combines the area’s Native American history and Mennonite community with traditional skills like calligraphy and canning fruit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004u3b6o7r0hswui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On a recent Tuesday, atop the museum’s dark coffee table, notes scrawled onto white paper listed the latest shipments of vitamin C and Alaskan cod liver oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004v3b6ozfcf6xxb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The supplies, Siemens said, were for one of the local doctors who met with Kennedy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004w3b6oz02xu2hs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As measles tears through the community, Siemens said families have to decide whether to get vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004x3b6oahxj5yfv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In America, we have a choice,” she said, echoing Kennedy’s messaging. “The cod liver oil that was flown in, the vitamin C that was flown in, was a great help.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004y3b6oitpofuug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Philip Huang, director and health authority for the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, is working to keep the measles outbreak from reaching his community, just five hours east of Seminole. He wrote letters to the public school superintendents and leaders of private schools that had large numbers of unvaccinated or undervaccinated students offering to set up mobile vaccine clinics for them.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004z3b6ou38lo62l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Overall, the rates can look OK,” he said, “but when you’ve got these pockets of unvaccinated, that’s where the vulnerability lies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00503b6oyc8d96am@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Huang has had to lay off 11 full-time employees, 10 temporary workers and cancel more than 50 vaccine clinics following the HHS cuts. The systemic dismantling of the CDC and other federal health agencies, he said, will have a grave and lasting impact.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00513b6ocn9votuv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is setting us back decades,” Huang said. “Everyone should be extremely concerned about what’s going on.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00523b6owlqdlai8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Across the country, pediatricians are petrified, said Dr. Susan Kressly, who serves as president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the largest professional organization of pediatricians in the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00533b6oebeebuy8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many of us are losing sleep,” Kressly said. “If we lose that progress, children will pay the price.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00543b6oul37gr61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She’s carefully watching the spread of several vaccine-preventable diseases, including an increase in whooping cases that far outpace the typical peaks seen every few years. Although the whooping cough vaccine isn’t as effective as the ones for measles and protection wanes over time, the CDC says it remains the best way to prevent the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00553b6o9r9fe7ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Babies under the age of 1 are among the most at risk of severe complications from whooping cough, including slowed or stopped breathing and pneumonia, according to the CDC. About one-third of infants who get whooping cough end up in the hospital. Newborns are especially vulnerable because the CDC doesn’t recommend the first shot until two months. That’s why experts recommend pregnant mothers and anyone who will be around the baby to get vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00563b6o2mp9c90y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The number of whooping cough cases dropped significantly during the pandemic, but it exploded in recent years. In 2021, the CDC reported 2,116 cases; last year, there were 35,435.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00573b6or50e0g8d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The numbers this year appear set to eclipse 2024. So far in 2025, 7,111 cases have been reported, which is more than double this time last year. Cases tend to spike in the summer and fall, which adds to experts’ concern about high numbers so early in the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00583b6ofndyr6ro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            States on the Pacific Coast and in the Midwest have reported the most cases this year, with Washington leading the country with 742 cases so far, more than five times as many as at this time last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00593b6oc5iwtho7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Washington child who died of whooping cough had no underlying medical conditions, according to a spokesperson for the Spokane Regional Health District. The death was announced in February but occurred in November.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005a3b6ofo8tbqm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While Washington’s overall vaccination rate for whooping cough has remained relatively steady over the last decade at around 90%, pockets of low vaccination rates have allowed the disease to take root and put the wider community at risk, said Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett, a pediatrician and chief health officer of the Washington State Department of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005b3b6op6ev6cqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is the time to strengthen the public health system, he said, to build trust in those areas and make it easier for children to get their routine vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005c3b6o2zjre9qf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But instead, we’re seeing the exact opposite happen,” he said. “We’re weakening our public health system, and that will put us on a path towards more illness and shorter lives.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005d3b6oskrkcxpv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Washington was one of 23 states and the District of Columbia that sued HHS and Kennedy following the $11 billion cuts, which rescinded approximately $118 million from the state. Doing so, the state said in court records, would impact 150 full-time employees and cause an immediate reduction in the agency’s ability to respond to outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005e3b6o0ike7y3i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Washington’s Care-A-Van, a mobile health clinic that travels across the state to provide vaccinations, conduct blood pressure screenings and distribute opioid overdose kits, was a key element in the department’s vaccination efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005f3b6osvm6zf41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that, too, has been diminished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005g3b6o2pmyq109@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An alert on the department’s website cataloged the impact.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005h3b6o3wjfc9d9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Attention,” it began.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005i3b6ozi0phma9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a result of the unexpected decision to terminate grant funding, “all Care-A-Van operations have been paused indefinitely, including the cancellation of more than 104 upcoming clinics across the state.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005j3b6okqdhiijr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The department had anticipated providing approximately 2,000 childhood vaccines as part of that effort.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005k3b6oi9d8g1mj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The frustration came through in Kwan-Gett’s voice. Many people think that federal cuts to public health mean shrinking the federal workforce, he said, but those clawbacks also get passed down to states and cities and counties. The less federal support that trickles down to the local level, the less protected communities will be.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005l3b6oebzc9wdk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It really breaks my heart,” he said, “when I see children suffering from preventable diseases like whooping cough and measles when we have the tools to prevent them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005m3b6otplxywke@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

A recent study revealed that the average human brain may contain the equivalent of a whopping five plastic bottle caps' worth of microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The New York Times took a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/well/microplastics-health.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:deeper dive;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;deeper dive&lt;/a&gt; into the topic on the heels of that study making the rounds in February, showing that scientists are only beginning to scratch the surface of what this could mean for our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/hBueN" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:groundbreaking study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;groundbreaking study&lt;/a&gt; led by researchers at the University of New Mexico, scientists found that brain samples from 2024 contained nearly 50% more microplastics than those from just eight years ago. The average brain held roughly seven grams of plastic — the same as a disposable spoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More concerning still, the researchers observed higher levels of microplastics in the brains of people with dementia, though as the Times noted, the scientists at the lab "noted that might be because those brains have a more porous blood-brain barrier and are less able to clear toxins." Similar plastic particles have already been found in the human &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/199/1/81/7609801?login=true" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:placenta;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;placenta&lt;/a&gt;, bloodstream, and even a baby's first stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As plastic accumulation balloons in the environment, it mirrors this growth in our bodies. "This stuff is increasing in our world exponentially," toxicologist Dr. Matthew Campen told &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/well/microplastics-health.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The New York Times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this discovery concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Once they enter the human body, some microplastic particles are so small they can pass through critical barriers and lodge in organs like the brain. While scientists haven't yet nailed down how much plastic is too much, early research findings suggest nothing short of dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cue the groans of hopelessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I don't think I've talked to a single person who's said: 'Fantastic! Love to know that there's all that plastic in my brain,'" Dr. Campen told the Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Current research shows links between microplastics and serious health issues, including cognitive decline, reproductive concerns, immune system disruption, memory loss, hormonal disruptions, and even developmental problems in children.

This symptom—often described as numbness—was significantly more common in people who had taken antidepressants compared to those who used other psychiatric medications. The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-024-02769-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that a notable portion of young antidepressant users may experience enduring sexual side effects, particularly among sexual and gender minority groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were motivated by growing concern around a condition known as post-SSRI sexual dysfunction, in which sexual side effects, including reduced genital sensitivity, continue even after discontinuing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and similar antidepressants. While these side effects are recognized during treatment, there is less awareness about their potential persistence. Many patients may not feel comfortable discussing sexual difficulties with their doctors, and some clinicians may attribute the symptoms to underlying psychological issues rather than possible effects of the medication. This has made it difficult to estimate how common persistent sexual side effects really are, particularly in non-clinical populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this knowledge gap, the research team analyzed data from a large, anonymous online survey called UnACoRN (Understanding Affirming Communities, Relationships, and Networks), conducted in 2022. The survey gathered responses from 9,679 young people aged 15 to 29 across the United States and Canada, with more than 95% identifying as sexual or gender minorities. Of these, 2,179 participants had used psychiatric medication in the past and had been sexually active—criteria that allowed for assessment of genital sensitivity during and after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked if they had ever experienced “less feeling in your genitals when having sex,” and whether this symptom continued after they stopped taking their medication. The researchers focused on those who reported past use of antidepressants, sedatives, or antipsychotics, while excluding anyone who had undergone genital surgery or who had not been sexually active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed a striking difference between medication groups. Among participants who had taken antidepressants, 30.8% reported genital numbness during treatment, and 13.2% said the symptom continued after they stopped the medication. In contrast, only 8.2% of those who took sedatives or antipsychotics (but not antidepressants) reported genital numbness, and just 1.0% said the symptom persisted. No persistent symptoms were reported among those who had only taken antipsychotics and had stopped treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand these results, the researchers used statistical models that accounted for several factors, including age, sex assigned at birth, use of gender-affirming hormones, and depression severity. Even after adjusting for these variables, past use of antidepressants was strongly associated with reports of persistent genital numbness. The odds were more than 14 times higher for those who had taken antidepressants compared to those who had not. Sedative use and severe depression were also linked to increased reports of persistent genital numbness, though to a lesser extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings point to reduced genital sensitivity as a potential marker of long-term antidepressant effects. The symptom, often referred to in medical literature as genital hypoesthesia, is considered a defining feature of post-SSRI sexual dysfunction. Unlike more general sexual difficulties, which can be associated with depression itself, genital numbness is less commonly linked to psychological causes and may be more directly related to the pharmacological effects of certain drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study found these symptoms in a young, sexually diverse population that is often underrepresented in clinical research. Sexual and gender minority youth are more likely to be prescribed antidepressants due to higher rates of mood and anxiety disorders. This makes it especially important to understand the full range of potential side effects they might face when undergoing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study offers new insight into a relatively understudied phenomenon, it also has several limitations. The survey did not distinguish between specific types of antidepressants, such as SSRIs versus other drug classes, although most antidepressant prescriptions for youth are SSRIs or SNRIs. The data were also based on self-reports, which introduces the possibility of recall bias. Additionally, the researchers could not determine how long symptoms persisted after treatment or whether they were limited to reduced genital sensitivity or included other sexual side effects. The survey did not include baseline measures of sexual functioning before participants began taking medication, so it’s not possible to confirm whether the antidepressants caused the symptoms or simply coincided with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize the need for future studies to follow people over time and assess sexual symptoms before, during, and after treatment. Such longitudinal research would help determine whether reduced genital sensitivity is truly a lasting effect of antidepressant use, how long it tends to persist, and whether any treatments can help reverse it. More clinical research is also needed to better understand the biological mechanisms involved and whether certain people are more vulnerable than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people benefit from SSRI/SNRI medications; however, they may cause persistent symptoms of sexual dysfunction,” the researchers concluded. “Transparency about the risks and meaningful informed consent are central to ethical prescribing. Additionally, patients should be made aware of alternative treatments, particularly those at an early stage of sexualdevelopment. Increased surveillance and industry regulation are paramount to avoid further iatrogenic outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-024-02769-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Frequency of self-reported persistent post-treatment genital hypoesthesia among past antidepressant users: a cross-sectional survey of sexual and gender minority youth in Canada and the US&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Yassie Pirani, J.

Kennedy Jr. claimed in a televised Cabinet meeting Thursday that measles cases were plateauing nationally, but the virus continues to spread mostly in people who are unvaccinated, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention redeployed a team to west Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024, and Texas is reporting the majority of them, with 541 as of last week’s updated count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas’ cases include two unvaccinated elementary school-age children who died from measles-related illnesses near the epicenter of the outbreak in rural west Texas, which led Kennedy to visit the community this month. The third person who died was an adult in New Mexico who also was not vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other states with active outbreaks — defined as having three or more cases — include New Mexico, Indiana, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/aP4Au/?v=3" target="_blank"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, Ohio and Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multistate outbreak confirms health experts’ fears that the virus will take hold in other U.S. communities with low vaccination rates and that the spread could stretch on for a year. The World Health Organization has said cases in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON561" target="_blank"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; are linked to the Texas outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and had been considered eliminated from the U.S. in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what else you need to know about measles in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="texas-and-new-mexico" class="subhead"&gt;Texas and New Mexico&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas’ outbreak began in late January. State health officials said Friday that there were 36 new cases of measles since Tuesday, bringing the total to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sxSwi/?v=7" target="_blank"&gt;541 across 22 counties&lt;/a&gt; — most of them in west Texas. A total of 56 Texans have been hospitalized throughout the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the confirmed cases, state health officials estimated Friday that about 5% are actively infectious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty-five percent of Texas’ cases are in Gaines County, population 22,892, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has logged 355 cases since late January — just over 1% of the county’s residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest death in Texas was that of an 8-year-old child. Health officials in Texas said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of “what the child’s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.” A 6-year-old died of measles in Texas in late February. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Mexico announced two new cases Friday, bringing the state’s total to 58. State health officials say the cases are linked to Texas’ outbreak based on genetic testing. Most are in Lea County, where two people have been hospitalized, two are in Eddy County and one is in Chaves County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Mexico reported its first measles-related death in an adult on March 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="kansas" class="subhead"&gt;Kansas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/aP4Au/?v=3" target="_blank"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; has 32 cases in eight counties in the southwest part of the state, health officials announced Wednesday. Two of the counties, Finney and Ford, are new on the list and are major population centers in that part of the state. Haskell County has the most with eight cases, Stevens County has seven, Kiowa County has six, and the rest have five or fewer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state’s first reported case, identified in Stevens County on March 13, is linked to the Texas and New Mexico outbreaks based on genetic testing, a state health department spokesperson said. But health officials have not determined how the person was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="oklahoma" class="subhead"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases in Oklahoma increased by two Friday to 12 total: nine confirmed and three probable cases. The first two probable cases were “associated” with the west Texas and New Mexico outbreaks, the state health department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A health department spokesperson said measles exposures were confirmed in Tulsa and Rogers counties, but wouldn’t say which counties had cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="ohio" class="subhead"&gt;Ohio&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ohio Department of Health confirmed 20 measles cases in the state as of Thursday: 11 in Ashtabula County near Cleveland, seven in Knox County and one each in Allen and Holmes counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohio is not including nonresidents in its count, a state health department spokesperson told the Associated Press. The Knox County outbreak in east-central Ohio has infected 14 people, according to a news release from the county health department, but seven of them do not live in Ohio. In 2022, a measles outbreak in central Ohio sickened 85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak in Ashtabula County started with an unvaccinated adult who had interacted with someone who had traveled internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="indiana" class="subhead"&gt;Indiana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indiana confirmed six connected cases of measles in Allen County in the northeast part of the state; four are unvaccinated minors and two are adults whose vaccination status is unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases have no known link to other outbreaks, the Allen County Department of Health said Wednesday. The first case was confirmed April 7.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="elsewhere" class="subhead"&gt;Elsewhere&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles cases also have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines an outbreak as three or more related cases. The agency counted &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/" target="_blank"&gt;seven clusters&lt;/a&gt; that qualified as outbreaks in 2025 as of Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., cases and outbreaks are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. It can then spread, especially in communities with low vaccination rates. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases. So far in 2025, the CDC’s count is 712.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-a-measles-booster-necessary" class="subhead"&gt;Is a measles booster necessary?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt; (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak, said Scott Weaver with the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults with “presumptive evidence of immunity” generally don’t need measles shots now, the CDC said. Criteria include written documentation of adequate vaccination earlier in life, lab confirmation of past infection or having been born before 1957, when most people were likely to be infected naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A doctor can order a lab test called an MMR titer to check your levels of measles antibodies, but experts don’t always recommend it and health insurance plans may not cover it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have documentation of having received a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said. That also includes people who don’t know which type they got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-symptoms" class="subhead"&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;dangerous complications&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-you-treat-measles" class="subhead"&gt;How can you treat measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-do-vaccination-rates-matter" class="subhead"&gt;Why do vaccination rates matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called herd immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shastri writes for the Associated Press.

Yet nearly 12.5% of the people in the U.S. aged 19 or older are not getting enough of this essential vitamin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is particularly common among older adults, people who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet and individuals with certain digestive disorders. If you fall into one of these groups, you may have been advised to take a vitamin B12 supplement. However, in order to unlock your supplement’s full potential, timing may be just as important as the supplement itself. So, we asked dietitians for their expertise on the best time to take vitamin B12 for maximum absorption.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The dosage and delivery (supplement vs. intramuscular injection) should be personalized to the individual and adjusted as lab levels change. For those with malabsorption issues, intramuscular B12 injections may be necessary. For others, oral B12 supplements can be effective for raising vitamin B12 and typically cost far less,” Clark explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Oral B12 supplements can vary in form, with options ranging from tablets and sprays to drops placed under the tongue. Studies suggest there is no difference in efficacy between the different delivery methods.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-optimal-timing-for-vitamin-b12-intake"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Optimal Timing for Vitamin B12 Intake &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While research hasn’t nailed down a set-in-stone time for optimal absorption, taking your vitamin B12 supplement in the morning before breakfast is often recommended. Here’s why: &lt;a href="https://www.delishknowledge.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alexandra Caspero, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian specializing in plant-based nutrition, shares that vitamin B12 absorption peaks around 7 hours after taking it, which is why many practitioners suggest incorporating it into your morning routine to reap its benefits throughout the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To make it easier to remember, Clark recommends pairing your B12 supplement with an existing habit, like brushing your teeth in the morning. After all, B12 is a water-soluble vitamin, meaning it doesn’t stick around in your body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Therefore, consistency is crucial for keeping your B12 levels up and correcting any deficiency.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-factors-affecting-vitamin-b12-absorption"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Factors Affecting Vitamin B12 Absorption &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting the timing right is just one part of the equation. Other factors can either help or hinder the absorption of vitamin B12.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Factors That Enhance Absorption &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to enhancing vitamin B12 absorption, the dose matters. “B12 is absorbed differently than other B vitamins, and that’s because of intrinsic factor, a protein found in the stomach that is needed for proper B12 absorption. We only absorb about 1 microgram of B12 at a time, though that number can vary based on the dose,” says Caspero.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For this reason, you will notice that vitamin B12 supplements contain a higher amount of B12 than is normally found in food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “For those who consume B12 throughout the day from animal products, this isn’t usually a concern. However, for vegans and vegetarians, if taking only a single supplement, then a higher dose is needed,” Caspero explains. As such, she suggests that adults take at least 25 micrograms of vitamin B12 daily, with higher doses of 50 to 250 micrograms during pregnancy and lactation to support absorption and address deficiencies.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it’s always best to consult your health care provider to evaluate your B12 levels and determine the dosage that’s right for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Factors That Prevent Absorption &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Absorbing vitamin B12 isn’t always a smooth process, as there are several factors that can complicate its uptake in the body. For instance, inadequate stomach acid and intrinsic factor can hinder absorption. “Stomach acid helps cleave B12 from food, and intrinsic factor is essential for transporting B12 into the small intestine. However, various conditions and medications can reduce stomach acid and intrinsic factor, raising your risk of B12 deficiency,” says Clark. These include pernicious anemia, certain medications like antacids and metformin, gastric bypass surgery and even older age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Additionally, Clark points out that gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, can impair absorption in the small intestines, contributing to low B12 levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-potential-side-effects-and-considerations"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Potential Side Effects and Considerations &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin B12 supplements are well-tolerated and safe for most people. In fact, the Food and Nutrition Board hasn’t set a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for B12, which is the maximum safe dose unlikely to cause adverse health effects. This is because B12 is water-soluble, so your body uses what it needs and flushes the rest out through your urine. Therefore, even in large doses, B12 is considered safe.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, Clark highlights that, on rare occasions, some people experience adverse reactions after taking vitamin B12, including diarrhea and itchy skin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Caspero adds that there have also been reports of acne-like symptoms when vitamin B12 is taken in large, daily doses over 1000 micrograms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Optimal levels of vitamin B12 are required for red blood cell formation, DNA synthesis and to protect nerve fibers. Supplementation is often recommended for those following a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291622/the-health-benefits-of-eating-a-plant-based-diet-and-how-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based eating pattern&lt;/a&gt;, older adults and individuals with digestive conditions. To get the most out of your supplement, dietitians recommend taking it first thing in the morning. However, the most important factor is to remember to take your supplement consistently. Just be sure to consult with your health care provider to discuss potential medication interactions and determine the best form and dosage for your individual needs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Leafy greens like kale and spinach are full of fiber, vitamins and minerals, and nutritionists want to see us eating more of them to stave off chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But turning this rabbit's food into a delicious dish takes patience and skill that some people lack. If you aren't up for dealing with food prep and cleanup, you can go for days without eating anything green.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Just &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7101a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 10&lt;/a&gt; of Americans meet the daily recommendations for veggies, which is &lt;a href="https://www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/vegetables" target="_blank"&gt;2-4 cups&lt;/a&gt; a day.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Now a silly food hack has emerged on TikTok to make eating them easier: People have taken to shoving fistfuls of greens into their mouths, sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/04/20/151034145/rewash-that-pre-washed-bag-of-lettuce-dont-bother-probably#:~:text=Indeed%2C%20many%20(though%20not%20all,washing%20bagged%20lettuce%20or%20spinach." target="_blank"&gt;straight from the bag&lt;/a&gt;, so they can get all of the nutrients — fiber, vitamins C and K, calcium, iron — with minimal effort.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The trend has been dubbed "Dinosaur Time," and it may have been started by a former middle school science teacher in California named Amy Garrett, who uses the TikTok handle &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sahmthingsup/video/7478079568339848494?_r=1&amp;amp;_t=ZP-8vQQhMM3Kxy" target="_blank"&gt;@sahmthingsup&lt;/a&gt; and has nearly 50,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During her toddler's naptime, Garret films videos of herself chomping down on romaine lettuce or spinach while she stands over her kitchen sink and the Jurassic Park theme plays in the background. These TikToks have been shared over 200,000 times and inspired others to incorporate Dinosaur Time into their diets.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Leafy greens are among the most nutritious of foods, even when compared to other fruits and vegetables, says Julie Stefanski, a registered dietician in Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Eating them regularly &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-area/gfnd/gfhnrc/docs/news-articles/2013/dark-green-leafy-vegetables#:~:text=The%20dark%20greens%20supply%20a,against%20the%20development%20of%20cancer." target="_blank"&gt;helps decrease the risks&lt;/a&gt; of heart disease and certain cancers. Studies have also found that they can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5772164/" target="_blank"&gt;slow age-related cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32455149/" target="_blank"&gt; help people maintain bone density&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;So the more you can get them in your diet the better, says Stefanski, even if your meal isn't exactly elegant. "We often strive for so much perfection with food or culinary techniques, and it's really not necessary."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Garrett told NPR she first started doing Dinosaur Time when she was doing CrossFit semi-competitively and was struggling to hit her daily nutrition goals. Another athlete shared they accomplished this by eating handfuls of plain greens before meals; Garrett gave it a try and found that gnashing the big, messy bites of raw spinach, bok choy or microgreens was both easy and made her feel like a monstrous herbivore.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Now a stay-at-home mom with limited time, she's picked up Dino Time again.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Instead of feeling guilty about not eating vegetables. I'm just gonna stuff them down my face and eat what I'd normally have eaten without any guilt," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Eating raw greens without any oil or salad dressing would taste disgusting for some. That's OK, says Andrea Mathis, an Alabama-based food blogger, and registered dietitian because "there are other ways that you can really enjoy spinach instead of eating it by the handfuls." And it's important to enjoy your food, she adds. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some easy alternatives that Mathis suggests: Wrap greens with some lean turkey as a snack, add them to omelets, or mix them into a smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Just throw it in your blender," she says, "You can have those nutrients and you can probably barely taste it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Or if someone wants to get their recommended &lt;a href="https://www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/vegetables" target="_blank"&gt;daily servings&lt;/a&gt; of vegetables in one sitting, then microwaving a bag of frozen veggies and putting a little seasoning on top is nearly as easy as Dinosaur Time. And it probably tastes better. Research shows frozen vegetables are nearly &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/05/17/611693137/frozen-food-fan-as-sales-rise-studies-show-frozen-produce-is-as-healthy-as-fresh" target="_blank"&gt;as good for you&lt;/a&gt; as fresh.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People prone to kidney stones should be cautious when doing Dinosaur Time, warns Mathis: Spinach and some other greens are high in oxalate, a compound that binds to calcium. Also, those who take blood thinners should consult their physician before adding Dinosaur Time to their diets.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One group on TikTok that seems to really enjoy Dinosaur Time is parents with kids. That doesn't surprise Stefanski, who used to work with kids with autism and sensory processing disorders, which can led to selective eating. She says one of the few things children can control is what they eat and they can hesitate to try a new food because they don't like how it looks or feels. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;By pretending to be giant reptiles, kids touch vegetables that they might otherwise avoid – which is a win, even if they don't end up eating anything since they're still exploring a new food.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Giving kids the space to do that on their own is so important," Stefanski says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stefanski doubts Dinosaur Time will become a permanent fixture in most peoples' diets as most food trends eventually go extinct. However, if you hate doing dishes then Dinosaur Time might be worth a try. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To be clear, Stefanski and Mathis don't want people to replace their meals with large quantities of raw greens. Dinosaur Time should be additive to people's normal eating patterns, not a weight-loss strategy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Garrett agrees, which is why she shows what she's eating for lunch at the end of each TikTok. Recent meals include barbacoa, a tuna sandwich, and shawarma.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Emma Longsjo of Boston says that's part of Dinosaur Time's appeal. She grew up doing ballet and felt pressure to be thin; as an adult, she tries to avoid social media content that conflates health with body image. But with Dinosaur Time, she knows she's doing something good for her body, that's also kind of fun.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The first time I was thinking of that scene in Jurassic Park where they're seeing the long neck one, where he's like, chomping on the trees," says Longsjo, referring to when the stunned scientists first encounter a brachiosaurus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So far, Longsjo has polished off three bags of spinach because of Dinosaur Time and plans to buy a fourth this week.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sarah Boden is a freelance health and science writer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Your stomach can’t break down inulin, she said, so it passes into your intestines undigested.

Carrier eventually switched doctors and says her access to antibiotics changed. Among other things, her new doctor was concerned about antibiotic resistance, which happens when the bacteria no longer responds to certain antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I’d used [antibiotics] probably three times a week for about a year at that point,” she says. Carrier says she was “terrified” that the antibiotics would one day stop working for her. “UTIs were one of the worst things I’ve been through,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Liz S. also struggles with recurrent UTIs, but has another challenge: She’s allergic to sulfa-based antibiotics, which limits the type of medication she can take.

However, it’s important to talk to your doctor about this since some infections won’t clear up without the right course of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take antibiotics only when prescribed&lt;/strong&gt;.

Another 2.4 million people in this country are chronically infected with hepatitis B, which is the leading cause of liver cancer globally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B is preventable, and hepatitis C is curable. But the U.S. capacity to battle these viral scourges has been leveled a devastating blow with the April 1 closure of the country’s premier testing laboratory for viral hepatitis, experts warned. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lab was one of the targets of this month’s Department of Health and Human Services reductions in force, or RIFs, which slashed about 18% of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s workforce and abruptly terminated many of the public health programs conducted by the Atlanta-based agency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The loss of the CDC’s viral hepatitis lab will leave the country with no good way to measure the scale of the problem it faces with these diseases, they suggested, and less able to find the sources of — and put an end to — outbreaks that can be linked to contaminated food, in the case of hepatitis A, or poor infection control procedures in medical facilities, in the case of hepatitis B and C. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Without [the lab] we won’t have any idea of what the distribution of viral hepatitis is in the U.S.,” said Chari Cohen, president of the Hepatitis B Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on finding a cure and improving the quality of life for people living with hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The preponderance of the CDC cuts were in the areas of chronic disease, environmental health, and injury prevention, with many of the infectious diseases teams at the agency emerging relatively intact so far. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite that, the 27 full-time workers who staffed the viral hepatitis laboratory in the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention were among those axed. Colleagues who work on surveillance and hepatitis control were saved, but will be forced to conduct their work without the evidence generated by their lab, which provided critical data to help them pinpoint the source of outbreaks or revise control policy when needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Without the lab, public health officials working to stop transmission of hepatitis viruses are like police officers trying to solve a crime without the capacity to analyze fingerprints or test for the DNA of the perpetrator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’re one of the only labs in the world who did the kind of specimen analysis that they did. Highly, highly specialized molecular analysis of viral hepatitis samples,” Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;David Margolius, director of public health for the city of Cleveland, suggested closing the CDC’s hepatitis lab is self-defeating.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not saving money. It’s setting us backwards,” Margolius told STAT in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The most recent year of analysis of hepatitis C showed the first decline in nationwide cases for the first time in years, and there is a cure for hepatitis C, which is relatively new. And so with effort and leadership from the federal government, we could end the hepatitis C epidemic in our country and cure everybody,” he said. “It’s a small investment for a big payoff.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis is an umbrella term for inflammation of the liver, which can be caused by a variety of things. But a handful of viruses, known as hepatitis A through E, are common causes of the condition, and the targets of study of the recently shuttered lab. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis A and E are transmitted through what’s known as the fecal-oral route, meaning &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/frozen-strawberries-2023/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;something contaminated&lt;/a&gt; with the virus is ingested. Hepatitis B and C are spread through bodily fluids, with B most commonly passing from an infected person to their baby during childbirth, and C associated with sharing needles during injected drug use, or improperly sterilized medical equipment. Hepatitis B, C, and D can also be transmitted during sex, though that is less common for C.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some people infected with these viruses will clear the infection on their own. But for some people, hepatitis B and C infections become chronic, and eventually life-threatening. There is no cure for hepatitis B, though there is an effective vaccine, which is supposed to be given to newborns to prevent infection at birth. The younger one is when infected with hepatitis B, the higher the chance that the infection will become chronic, potentially leading to liver damage, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. People who develop chronic hepatitis B face a lifetime of medication to control their illness. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the key hurdles in preventing transmission of these viruses is that many people who are infected do not know it. And without the CDC lab, estimating how many infections there are nationally and where transmission is most intense may no longer be possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commercial laboratories that process tests for clinicians and hospitals generate some data, but tallies based on them only count the infections that have come to the medical community’s attention. They cannot be used to calculate how many people are infected and unaware of that fact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The way those estimates have been generated has been through the CDC lab, which every two years tests a nationally representative number of samples from people who take part in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&lt;/a&gt;, known as NHANES. Those findings are used to estimate the prevalence of hepatitis A through E among Americans. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;One of the impacted staff from the viral hepatitis division, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said the lab group was just about to begin analyzing the most recent round of NHANES specimens when the lab was closed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are now blind to a lot of these things. You can’t develop a response if you don’t know your burden. And you can’t pick up hot spots,” said Su Wang, an internal medicine specialist in Florham Park, N.J., whose practice treats many viral hepatitis patients and who is on the board of the Hepatitis B Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cohen said trends in infections could perhaps be estimated by studying large datasets from private labs, “but they’re never going to give you a picture of what’s happening overall.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lab’s closure comes at a time when there are multiple outbreaks in the country, at &lt;a href="https://www.masslive.com/news/2025/03/baystate-wing-hospital-patients-urged-to-test-for-hepatitis-hiv-after-sterilization-issue.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;least two&lt;/a&gt; of which are associated with &lt;a href="https://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/local/2025/03/22/florida-surgeon-general-ladapo-emergency-restriction-melbourne-doctor-hepatitis-c-cluster/82544616007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;medical facilities&lt;/a&gt;. Finding out that cases are linked — and figuring out how the infections took place — is crucial to determining if a clinic or hospital is failing on infection control, said the CDC worker who asked not to be named. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s important for the authorities to know this clinic or this particular facility really is responsible for having this pathogen transmitted because they have a breach in infection control practices,” the individual said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Determining that cases are linked requires a laboratory to generate genetic sequences of viruses from a variety of cases and compare the sequences. This is not something commercial labs can be expected to do, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Yes, they can receive a diagnosis from any commercial lab,” the individual said. “But whether they are part of the same transmission cluster, whether they got infected at the same facility or they got infected elsewhere, that information they cannot get from a health department. They cannot get this information from any commercial lab. Because there’s no money to be made there.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The closure also comes as the lab was making big strides in developing a point-of-care test for hepatitis C, something that has long been needed and does not exist anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testing for hepatitis C is currently a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-c/about/index.html#cdc_disease_basics_testing_screening-screening-testing-and-diagnosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;two-step process&lt;/a&gt;. A single blood draw that could determine on the spot whether a person is infected would be a game-changer, especially now that there are direct-acting antiviral pills that are effectively a cure. “This is a significant need in our field so that you can identify those millions of individuals and they can benefit from this treatment,” said the CDC employee. Work on the test was &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jcm.00771-23" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;progressing positively&lt;/a&gt;, though it still needed fine-tuning. Where that work goes now is unknown, the person said. “In the middle of it, it is all shut down.”&lt;/p&gt;

to help create sharper images may cause some patients to experience a potentially deadly complication in rare cases, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of New Mexico found that gadolinium – a toxic rare earth metal used in MRI scans – could mix with oxalic acid found in many foods to precipitate tiny&lt;a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/nanoplastics-forever-chemicals-may-hinder-112544255.html" data-ylk="slk:nanoparticles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt; nanoparticles&lt;/a&gt; of the metal in human tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Magnetic Resonance Imaging, &lt;/em&gt;assessed the formation of these nanoparticles associated with potentially deadly health problems in the &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/cancer-treatment-patients-acupuncture-herbal-medicine-homeopathy-death-rate-higher-a8454791.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kidneys and other organs.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;kidneys and other organs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists say gadolinum-based contrast agents may cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, a rare condition leading to the thickening and hardening of the skin, heart, and lungs with painful contracture of the joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People have succumbed after just a single dose,” said Brent Wagner, an author of the study from UNW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A volunteer takes part in a magnetic resonance imaging exam simulation (AFP via Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When injected, gadolinum tightly binds to other molecules and is excreted from the body, and most people experience no adverse effects, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, even in those without symptoms, the metal particles have been found in &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/kidney" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kidney;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;kidney&lt;/a&gt; and brain tissues, and has been detected in the blood and urine “years after exposure”, scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest study probed why some people get sick while most don’t and how gadolinium particles get pried loose from the other molecules in the contrast agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This nanoparticle formation might explain a few things. It might explain why there's such an amplification of the disease,” Dr Wagner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When a cell is trying to deal with this alien metallic nanoparticle within it, it's going to send out signals that tell the body to respond to it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists particularly probed the role of oxalic acid – found in many foods like &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/tomatoes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tomatoes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;tomatoes&lt;/a&gt;, spinach, nuts and berries – as the molecule binds with metal ions and is implicated in the formation of kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxalic acid also forms in the body when people eat food or supplements containing &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/vitamin-c" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin C;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that oxalic acid caused small amounts of gadolinium to precipitate out of the contrast agent and form nanoparticles that infiltrated the cells of various organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients may be more susceptible to this kind of nanoparticle precipitation due to their &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/metabolism" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metabolism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It might be if they were in a high oxalic state or a state where molecules are more prone to linking to the gadolinium, leading to the formation of the nanoparticles,” Dr Wagner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That might be why some individuals have such awful symptoms and this massive disease response, whereas other people are fine,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers suggest some ways to mitigate risks associated with MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wouldn't take vitamin C if I needed to have an MRI with contrast because of the reactivity of the metal,” Dr Wagner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm hoping that we're getting closer to some recommendations for helping these individuals,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News UK</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 07:07:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5xTHVvaXF3WmRRcWZrYi1oY1RNM25QdWlFY2xxaUtDYzN5N3pwRlo3RjVjOFRRMG85b2tDYTkyRjVUZ0ZmRzF4R3hMWmFfMnJyYk9lV0NWc09fN2djMzZIWTN0STYwcmxiYmVOdGdzejRRMzg5TWpoekRnbGl0UQ</guid></item><item><title>普拉提教练说，这是每个人都应该尝试的对初学者友好的核心练习- Fit&amp;Well | A Pilates instructor says this is the beginner-friendly core exercise everyone should try - Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxOZWVya212MUxQUXM2MGJQOGRxaXZzWXBaN0pOdjA1UFVfbEF0Q2tublN6NHpUN2lOcE9XMTZtSDk4S1p5RlphYVZvTDJXcUhfWlJ5Q3R3LWpaRWlZQV95cTY4WWY1cVROOGVqMnU4UTIxNUxKVFBlOGJ5eUxFdFlxdUgyRHo2N1N6NzRPWUNHSmludmRaWklSbnk1ZmF4Nnh0OElfRnhzQjZ3SGdTMXBmX1JGbUNfNEpqZWFxSHNmcDBtOGJpS1g0cDhyWXhiQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed up with planks, sit-ups and crunches? You might want to try Pilates instead if you're serious about core strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This low-impact exercise focuses on slow, controlled movements that put the core muscles under constant tension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the practice engages the deep core muscles surrounding the spine, which include abdominal, back and pelvic floor muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there’s one beginner-friendly core Pilates move everyone can do: the tabletop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a move that people overlook, but it will help you build deep abdominal engagement and it teaches you how to control your breath,” explains Rachel Lennon, a Pilates instructor and the founder of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/wellnesstribe_studio/?igsh=ZXl1a2w2ZjV3dGpm#" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/wellnesstribe_studio/?igsh=ZXl1a2w2ZjV3dGpm#" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;The Wellness Tribe studio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/wellnesstribe_retreat/?igsh=MW82cWI2ZGd3ZXJlZg%3D%3D#" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/wellnesstribe_retreat/?igsh=MW82cWI2ZGd3ZXJlZg%3D%3D#" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;retreats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's a foundational move for your core, which will help you build amazing control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-tabletop"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do tabletop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet planted on the ground. Arms by your side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inhale, then as you exhale lift your right leg, then your left, so that your shins are parallel with the ground at a 90° angle. Your knees should be in line with the hips.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold for 30 seconds or longer, to make it more challenging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To make it more difficult, bring your hands behind your head and crunch for ten to 12 times, exhaling as you crunch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proper form is really important for this exercise. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core"&gt;To ensure your core is completely engaged&lt;/a&gt;, keep your back flat on the mat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qBnHf5ft4Wvi2DhA3RXEKg" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qBnHf5ft4Wvi2DhA3RXEKg slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Keep your tailbone tucked under and think about getting your belly button to your spine,” Lennon advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it feels like your core isn't engaged, bring the knees a little bit closer towards your chest” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to make this exercise more challenging, Lennon recommends extending your legs straight out so they hover above the floor or adding ankle weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-benefits-of-tabletop"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The benefits of tabletop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might not immediately feel the burn when holding the tabletop, like you do during a plank, but this move is activating those deep core muscles—a learned behavior that will serve you well during other exercises such as squats and deadlifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning to activate your core will make these exercises feel easier, and also help to protect your lower back and improve your posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lennon recommends starting your workouts with tabletop to activate your core. Try it before doing this &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/core-workout-for-beginners" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/core-workout-for-beginners"&gt;beginner's core workout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
