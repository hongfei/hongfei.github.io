Kennedy Jr. during a cabinet meeting at the White House on March 24, 2025. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/the Washington Post via Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;THREE PEOPLE HAVE DIED in Texas and more than five hundred have gotten sick in what is shaping up as the largest single measles outbreak in decades. And somehow Robert F. Kennedy Jr. still hasn’t provided a firm, unambiguous endorsement of vaccination, although you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise in light of the publicity around an interview he had with CBS News last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The interview aired on Wednesday, after Kennedy had met with the families of two Texas girls who recently died from the disease. The online version carried the headline “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/rfk-jr-says-people-should-get-the-measles-vaccine/" rel&gt;RFK Jr. says people should get the measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,” and if you happened to be on social media at the time (like I was) then &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/09/rfk-jr-vaccine-measles/83006142007/" rel&gt;some&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/health/measles-outbreak-urban-areas/index.html" rel&gt;version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of it probably popped onto your feeds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It certainly seemed like a big deal, because up to that point Kennedy had given only tepid, halfhearted endorsements of the vaccine. These were mostly in prepared, written statements—such as his April 6 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" rel&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; saying “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine”—so it wasn’t clear if the words were truly his. Now, finally, here was Kennedy in his familiar, raspy voice, lending his full endorsement as health and human services secretary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except that’s not what he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/subscribe?coupon=11472357&amp;amp;utm_content=161221201","text":"Get 30 day free trial","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/subscribe?coupon=11472357&amp;amp;utm_content=161221201" rel&gt;&lt;span&gt;Get 30 day free trial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you clicked through and actually watched the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqYXLeIhxj8" rel&gt;full interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, you quickly discovered he was giving his endorsement grudgingly, following repeated prompts from interviewer Dr. Jon LaPook. And when he was eventually unable to avoid answering, Kennedy framed his endorsement as a description of official HHS posture rather than a personal belief. “The federal government’s position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kennedy then proceeded to claim, as he had so many times before, that “we don’t know the risks of many of these products because they’re not safety tested.” That’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/11/as-trump-taps-rfk-jr-for-health-secretary-a-look-back-at-kennedys-claims/" rel&gt;not true&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;; vaccines go through extensive safety testing. And in the case of the MMR vaccine, there is now also more than a half-century of widespread clinical use—amounting to a real-world track record of several hundred million doses, giving a very clear safety picture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kennedy also claimed that a particular type of vaccine, those that target one rather than multiple proteins on a germ, have “never worked” for respiratory disease. That’s also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/10/rfk-jr-single-antigen-vaccines-novavax-fda-decision/" rel&gt;not true&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;; multiple vaccines work that way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this was after an extended exchange in which RFK suggested that the second Texas girl who died may have been a victim of some other illness: “She had extreme tonsillectomy . . . she was graph positive for bacteria in her bloodstream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“All of those are medical words,” Brown University professor &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pandemics.sph.brown.edu/people/craig-spencer-md-mph" rel&gt;Dr. Craig Spencer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; told me in an interview, referring to Kennedy’s invocation of an “extreme tonsillectomy” (which is not a standard medical term; it’s unclear whether he meant “radical tonsillectomy” or “an extreme case of tonsillitis”) and “graph positive” (the actual term is “Gram positive”). “It doesn’t mean that they actually reflect the reality of the medical case.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/dont-be-fooled-rfk-jr-kennedy-is-still-talking-down-vaccines-hhs-cuts-measles-cdc?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/dont-be-fooled-rfk-jr-kennedy-is-still-talking-down-vaccines-hhs-cuts-measles-cdc?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The theory that the girl died of something other than measles has been making the rounds online among vaccine skeptics and critics, much to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/Craig_A_Spencer/status/1909067761763971134" rel&gt;dismay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of researchers and doctors who understand that when children die of measles complications like pneumonia, that still means they died from the measles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And while Spencer made clear he hadn’t seen the medical files, so he could not say definitively what had happened, he noted that the public &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" rel&gt;health authorities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in Texas say that both girls died of measles—and that both were unvaccinated, as has been true for nearly all of the cases in this outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the days that followed, any lingering ambiguity about Kennedy’s true feelings disappeared—first, with a report in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/04/rfk-measles-grieving-families-texas/682386/" rel&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; that Kennedy had told the two girls’ parents that “You don’t know what’s in the vaccine anymore,” and then with Kennedy’s statement at Thursday’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/11/rfk-autism-study-causes-research/" rel&gt;cabinet meeting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that his new inquiry into the causes of autism would have an answer “by September.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Generally speaking, real scientific inquiries don’t deliver conclusions on neat deadlines, unless the people running them know the answer in advance—which is precisely how former Food and Drug Administration vaccine-safety official Dr. Peter Marks described Kennedy in his &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/28/nx-s1-5344010/fda-peter-marks-rfk-jr" rel&gt;resignation letter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; last month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the secretary,” Marks wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;THE CBS INTERVIEW and the visit with the Texas families came toward the end of a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/health/rfk-jr-maha-tour-navajo.html" rel&gt;multiday public tour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; through the Southwest that Kennedy used to spotlight his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda, including its focus on improving diet and exercise—and ridding the air, water, and food supplies of toxins—in order to reduce the overall burden of disease on Americans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a worthy cause, one that many physicians and researchers have been supporting literally for decades. And if all Kennedy were doing was pushing to intensify that pursuit, he’d likely have strong support from the public health establishment—and from elected officials in both parties too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But of course that is not all that Kennedy is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He is also presiding over a dramatic downsizing of HHS that even the most seasoned, even-tempered observers of American health care, like KFF News correspondent Julie Rovner, are calling a “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/podcast/what-the-health-392-hhs-dismantling-layoffs-funding-cuts-trump-rfk-april-10-2025/" rel&gt;dismantling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.” The key elements include a 25 percent reduction in the HHS workforce, mostly through layoffs, as well as a dramatic reduction in the funding of medical research. Grants to university labs and professors and other researchers from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are down 60 percent relative to a year ago, according to a recent tally in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/28/trump-administration-science-research-cuts/" rel&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to convey precisely what is happening at HHS—how it’s so unprecedented and why it’s so destructive—because the changes are happening in so many places throughout the department simultaneously, and with no transparency. Instead of clear announcements about cuts and reforms, word is getting out through news stories as journalists learn about them, making it difficult to stitch them into a single coherent narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share The Bulwark","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share The Bulwark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Late last week, for example, brought a report (also from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/milwaukee-schools-lead-poisoning-cdc-denies-help/" rel&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;) that the city of Milwaukee had requested the Centers for Disease Control send help after initial inspections in city schools had found evidence of “significant lead hazards.” CDC turned down the request, despite the well-documented damage lead can do to the brains of developing children, because its environmental-response team was wiped out in the recent cuts. “As far as I know, this would be the first time” in the CDC’s nearly eight decades that it did not respond to “a formal request for assistance from a state,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/DrTomFrieden/status/1910457311841444290" rel&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; former CDC director Tom Frieden.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A day later, the health-focused publication &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/11/hhs-layoffs-analysis-health-impact-nih-cuts-cdc-rif-fda-reduction-in-force/" rel&gt;STAT News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published a lengthy feature on how limits on external communication and cuts to basic administrative infrastructure like procurement offices had left researchers scrambling for basic supplies needed to keep experiments going. As one scientist told STAT, “There are email listservs going through the NIH that normally are for things like announcing interesting papers or talks that are now 90% ‘Anybody have this reagent? One little bit of this reagent that I can use?’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/dont-be-fooled-rfk-jr-kennedy-is-still-talking-down-vaccines-hhs-cuts-measles-cdc?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/dont-be-fooled-rfk-jr-kennedy-is-still-talking-down-vaccines-hhs-cuts-measles-cdc?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;ANOTHER REASON IT CAN BE DIFFICULT to capture the full scale of what’s happening at HHS is that the most serious effects may not be seen for years or even for decades—in the form of an outbreak that a greatly diminished CDC failed to stop, or tens of thousands of overdose deaths a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/when-make-america-healthy-again-actually-means-opposite-rfk-trump-opioid-overdose-hhs-samhsa-painful" rel&gt;decimated substance-abuse campaign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; failed to stop, or a set of cancers that never-conducted breakthrough research failed to cure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this isn’t just a function of all the research that the federal government has stopped funding. It’s also a function of lost expertise and institutional knowledge, from people HHS is firing now and will never hire in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this isn’t Kennedy’s doing alone. These assaults on HHS wouldn’t be happening if the department and its work weren’t the target of several overlapping agendas, including the effort to bring universities to heel, to punish the “deep state,” and to shrink the federal government to its smallest possible size. Nor would HHS be vulnerable to this kind of attack if not for lingering public resentment over government actions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and not exclusively on the MAGA right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, whatever memories the public has of masks and shutdowns, the vast majority of Americans care about cancer research and vigilance against pandemics—and they support vaccines too. That’s one reason why spotlighting Kennedy’s rhetorical evasions is so important, especially in weeks like this when they can be so easy to miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/dont-be-fooled-rfk-jr-kennedy-is-still-talking-down-vaccines-hhs-cuts-measles-cdc/comments","text":"Leave a comment","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/dont-be-fooled-rfk-jr-kennedy-is-still-talking-down-vaccines-hhs-cuts-measles-cdc/comments" rel&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leave a comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/dont-be-fooled-rfk-jr-kennedy-is-still-talking-down-vaccines-hhs-cuts-measles-cdc?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"&gt;&lt;a class="button primary" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/dont-be-fooled-rfk-jr-kennedy-is-still-talking-down-vaccines-hhs-cuts-measles-cdc?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Bulwark</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 12:31:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNUmlaZkxBWFVybmhHU1hWY3NGYTI3Y0RYNU5jaFZjaW1RY1R5dVM1TlFDTzJCcGQ0LU55ZmN2YVRhSm9xbmFfNjZkRklOMEpIR0RsV1VaTWxERVhWNU5ibVpENzV5TGhFcnlDX1Rmc2p5TnBkRWNhT1FpNzhKSUNBUzV5TnpfeWJDTFlielBuWF9STjlnZll1WDNfLUR1cVFYR3MzQnUyYVMyVi0zd0g0</guid></item><item><title>没有维生素K，您的大脑会发生什么？新研究揭示了令人惊讶的效果-Scitechdaily | What Happens to Your Brain Without Vitamin K?

&lt;p&gt;Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) applauded Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for promoting measles vaccination amid a deadly outbreak in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the spread, the U.S. has reported &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5246069-measles-cases-700-rfk-jr-pressure/"&gt;700 cases&lt;/a&gt; of the measles virus in states across the country.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana lawmaker said immunizations were safe and would be crucial to saving lives during a Sunday interview with radio host &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/people/john-catsimatidis/"&gt;John Catsimatidis&lt;/a&gt; on WABC 770 AM’s “The Cats Roundtable.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I want to complement Secretary of Health Bobby Kennedy because he’s now encouraging people to get the measles vaccine. It is the only proven way to avoid getting the measles,” Cassidy said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the past, Kennedy has supported anti-vaccine rhetoric and previously shared unproven claims that immunizations could cause autism spectrum disorder in children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cassidy addressed the misinformation in conversation with Catsimatidis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is this kind of conversation in our country as to whether or not children should be vaccinated. We now have two children who have died in west Texas from measles, a vaccine-preventable disease,” the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s been well established that vaccination does not cause autism. That was one of the concerns,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Some who worked under the HHS Secretary have expressed &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5239148-kennedys-moves-on-measles-dont-quell-criticism/"&gt;concerns&lt;/a&gt; about Kennedy’s ability to lead amid threats of a public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what he’s going to do, and I can’t make him do anything, but I can tell you, as a viewer, please consider getting your child vaccinated,” &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/people/peter-marks/"&gt;Peter Marks,&lt;/a&gt; the Food and Drug Administration vaccine official &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5221540-fda-official-resigns-kennedy-vaccines/"&gt;who resigned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5224288-fda-marty-makary-peter-marks/"&gt;amid pressure&lt;/a&gt; from the Trump administration, said in an &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5233896-peter-marks-fda-resignation-measles-vaccine/"&gt;interview with CNN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If they’re not vaccinated, it’s easy to ignore measles because we haven’t seen it,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Measles was previously considered &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/the-measles-outbreak-in-west-texas-and-beyond"&gt;eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in 2000 due to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is not just an innocent disease, benign disease. It kills one in 1,000 children in a developed country like the United States,” Marks said, highlighting the severity of a measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve already had two deaths in the United States, one in a child from this and these are needless deaths, because the vaccine is 98 percent effective against preventing measles, but close to 100 percent effective in preventing death,” the vaccine expert added.&lt;/p&gt;

But believe it or not, this substance actually serves a purpose ― and you need to be careful when it comes to removing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, experts break down what you need to know about dealing with earwax and cleaning out your ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First of all, you probably don’t need to clean out your ears&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people do not need to remove their ear wax,” said Dr. Erich P. Voigt, an associate professor in Otolaryngology-Head &amp;amp; Neck Surgery at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. “It is a protective coating of the ear canal. It is a waterproofing agent and has anti-microbial properties. It helps prevent outer ear infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to protecting your ears from water damage and infection, earwax also lubricates the ears, preventing the area from feeling dry and itchy. And like other &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/reasons-your-vagina-is-a-total-boss_n_6607722" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="parts of the body" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67f7fd44e4b09493c8d880f5" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="6607722" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;parts of the body&lt;/a&gt;, ears are “self-cleaning,” so you don’t really need to wash the inside area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think from an evolutionary standpoint,” said Dr. Lawrence R. Lustig, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology-Head &amp;amp; Neck Surgery at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. “If Mother Nature designed an ear that had to be cleaned, that would be a poor design. We didn’t have ear cleaners 500,000 years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He described the system as a “conveyer belt of skin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Earwax is a combination of skin and oil,” Lustig said. “Skin migrates out from the eardrum to the outside of the ear canal, and as those migrating dead skin cells mix with the oil glands of the ear canal on the way out, that’s where you get earwax.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people have a migration problem, produce too much wax or wax of an abnormal consistency. They might be prone to wax infections and require medical intervention to remove their earwax, which can block the ear and impair hearing. But for most of us, the wax clears out naturally as we go about our daily lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The body has a system for creating wax and pushing it out,” said Dr. Bradley B. Block, an otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon and host of the “Physician’s Guide to Doctoring” podcast. “As you chew and talk, the ear canal skin moves, and this pushes the wax out. Interfering with this system can lead to wax getting pushed in and accumulating, clogging the ear canal, so cleaning the ears can have the paradoxical effect of clogging the ear.”&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jonathan Kitchen via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jonathan Kitchen via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Your ears naturally clean themselves.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But if you insist on doing it, don’t use Q-tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you ask people what Q-tips are meant for, their answers will likely include cleaning out earwax. This practice has become so commonplace that Kevin James’ character in “Hitch”&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50YQeugOMOw" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" has a dance move" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67f7fd44e4b09493c8d880f5" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50YQeugOMOw" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt; has a dance move&lt;/a&gt; that mimics cleaning out the ears with a Q-tip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But pop culture fans might also remember that brutal scene from “Girls” when Hannah inserts a Q-tip too far into her ear and accidentally punctures her eardrum. The packaging for Q-tip products today even contains a clear warning: “Do not insert inside the ear canal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, cotton swabs like Q-tips can scratch the ear canal and cause bleeding or even lead to ear drum damage. Bottom line: Cleaning out your ears with Q-tips is not a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think about diameter of ear canal and diameter of Q-tips,” Lustig said. “If you can’t see what you’re doing, you can end up sort of packing all that wax in with a Q-tips. A lot of the time it acts as a plunger. When I have someone come in with an earwax infection, half the time it’s because they used Q-tips.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to packing the wax deeper and potentially causing it to get trapped in the ear, cleaning out your ears with Q-tips can lead to outer ear infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stripping the wax out of the canal can also leave the skin dry, and dry skin can get itchy,” Block added. “This leads to a cycle of using cotton swabs to clean out the wax, which makes them itch, so then you scratch with cotton swabs, which makes them itch, etc.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And bad news if you prefer using ear candles: In addition to causing other forms of potential harm, this method doesn’t seem to work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have actually been studies to see the amount of wax that comes out,” Lustig said. “It doesn’t seem to help at all, and there’s the risk of burning your ear doing it. It was trendy for awhile, but I think that trend has worn off ― though I’m sure ear candles will eventually arise from the dead like Lazarus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The better method for cleaning your ears is much simpler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re still wanting to clean your ears, just focus on the outside area and any wax that’s already on its way out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My general recommendation for people is let the body do its job,” Lustig said. “Let that skin migration with the wax come out on its own. Take a wet washrag onto your finger and clean out whatever comes to the entry point.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Block and Voigt recommended simply letting the normal showering and hair washing process clean the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just wipe the outside with a soapy finger or washcloth,” Block said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also products like Debrox drops, which contain carbamide peroxide (a combination of hydrogen peroxide and urea) to help dissolve the earwax. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ll often use that or straight up hydrogen peroxide,” Lustig said. “Hydrogen peroxide softens up those harder blocks. It’s safe to use assuming you don’t have a hole in your eardrum, which most people don’t. Sometimes the wax is really hard and we can use these mini tweezers called alligator forceps to clear it out. Sometimes it’s really soften and we suction it out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To clean out the ear with a solution like Debrox (or a similar solution of hydrogen peroxide and water, for instance), be sure follow the instructions on the product. Generally, the process involves lying on your side, administering a few drops, waiting a few minutes and then sitting up and blotting the area. You can then generally use warm water in the shower to flush out the ear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, as previously noted you really don’t need to clean out your earwax unless there’s a problem ― and even then, it’s best to have a medical professional handle the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ear canal is sensitive and has a lot of nerve endings,” Lustig said. “A light touch that might feel like a tickle elsewhere can really hurt in the ear. So I wouldn’t go putting things in there. And you have to be careful when irrigating the ear not to perforate the eardrum. You have to be careful to direct the jet of fluid in the correct location on the back wall.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See a doctor as soon as you notice an issue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re not likely to experience issues with wax buildup, but if you do, be sure to seek professional help. When your ear canal gets blocked, you may feel like you have an earplug in all the time, experience difficulty hearing or feel like your voice is echoing when you talk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors can help clear out the wax and check for other issues. Lustig noted that what some people suspect to be wax infection can actually be a bigger problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

It was a touchy time for the field. The Church of Scientology had organized a nationwide protest campaign against the psychiatric profession, and Ritalin, then the leading medication prescribed to children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, was one of its main targets. Whenever Swanson and his colleagues gathered for a scientific conference, they were met by chanting protesters waving signs and airplanes overhead pulling banners that read, “Psychs, Stop Drugging Our Kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It was true that prescription rates for Ritalin were on the rise. The number of American children diagnosed with A.D.H.D. more than doubled in the early 1990s, from fewer than a million patients in 1990 to more than two million in 1993, almost two-thirds of whom were prescribed Ritalin. To Swanson, at the time, that increase seemed entirely appropriate. Those two million children represented about 3 percent of the nation’s child population, and 3 percent was the rate that he and many other scientists believed was an accurate measure of A.D.H.D. among children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Still, you didn’t have to be a Scientologist to acknowledge that there were some legitimate questions about A.D.H.D. Despite Ritalin’s rapid growth, no one knew exactly how the medication worked or whether it really was the best way to treat children’s attention issues. Anecdotally, doctors and parents would observe that when many children began taking stimulant medications like Ritalin, their behavior would improve almost overnight, but no one had measured in a careful, large-scale scientific study how common that positive response was or, for that matter, what the effects were on a child of taking Ritalin over the long term. And so Swanson and a team of researchers, with funding from the National Institute of Mental Health, began a vast, multisite randomized controlled trial comparing stimulant treatment for A.D.H.D. with nonpharmaceutical approaches like parent training and behavioral coaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Swanson was in charge of the site in Orange County, Calif. He recruited and selected about 100 children with A.D.H.D. symptoms, all from 7 to 9 years old. They were divided into treatment groups — some were given regular doses of Ritalin, some were given high-quality behavioral training, some were given a combination and the remainder, a comparison group, were left alone to figure out their own treatment.

Kennedy Jr. presented himself as a supporter of vaccines. But in office, he and the agencies he leads have taken far-reaching, sometimes subtle steps to undermine confidence in vaccine efficacy and safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The National Institutes of Health &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://taggs.hhs.gov/Content/Data/HHS_Grants_Terminated.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;halted funding&lt;/a&gt; for researchers who study vaccine hesitancy and hoped to find ways to overcome it. It also &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/health/future-pandemics-vaccines-funding.html" title=""&gt;canceled programs&lt;/a&gt; intended to discover new vaccines to prevent future pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shelved an advertising campaign for the flu shot. Mr. Kennedy has said inaccurately that the scientists who advise the C.D.C. on vaccines have &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6368793267112" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;“severe, severe conflicts of interest”&lt;/a&gt; in promoting the products and cannot be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The Health and Human Services Department&lt;span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/health/trump-state-health-grants-cuts.html" title=""&gt;cut billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; to state health agencies, including funds needed to modernize state programs for childhood immunization.

In a televised interview last week, Mr. Kennedy said falsely that similarly created vaccines don’t work against respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some scientists said they saw a pattern: an effort to erode support for routine vaccination, and for the scientists who have long held it up as a public health goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Older adults have a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3118151/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;high mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; following hip fractures, and the leading cause of death in adults aged 65 and up is &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600454/table/ch2.tab4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, researchers from the University of Southampton, in the United Kingdom, published a paper in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging/articles/10.3389/fragi.2025.1490124/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; outlining their findings about associations between dietary choices and fractures and heart disease mortality in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 2 decades of monitoring a group of participants, the scientists learned that people who made more “prudent” dietary choices were more likely to have lower risks in these areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare providers advise their patients on preventative measures, such as how to prevent osteoporosis and heart disease, especially in older age. &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/155646" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt; causes weak bones which can lead to an increase in fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since nutritional choices are an important aspect of maintaining health, researchers often look into whether current recommendations are still appropriate and adjust them when new evidence arises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study looked into how a prudent diet and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248958" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt; intake affected bone fractures and heart disease mortality in the long run for older adults. Calcium is &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/calcium-and-vitamin-d-important-bone-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; to bone health, and a &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Heart Lung and Blood Institute " rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/heart-healthy-living/healthy-foods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; can lower heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The researchers described a prudent diet as “characterized by high consumption of fruit, vegetables, whole-grain cereals, and oily fish, with low consumption of white bread, chips, sugar, and full-fat dairy products.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 3,000 older adults joined the study: 47% of the participants were women, and 53% were men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They consented to home visits and clinical visits and also released their healthcare records so the researchers could keep tabs on their health. They also completed questionnaires about dietary and lifestyle choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the 20-year follow-up, 2% of men and 5% of women had a hip fracture during the study period; 22% of women and 9% of men had any type of fracture. For cardiovascular mortality, this occurred in 11% of men and 5% of women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as prudent diet choices and hip fractures were concerned, the researchers found an association between the two. People who made better dietary choices overall had a slightly reduced risk of this sort of fracture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When looking specifically at dietary calcium, this was not linked to a lower &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/hip-fracture-recovery" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;hip fracture&lt;/a&gt; risk, but the researchers did note it was associated with a protective benefit in regards to cardiovascular mortality. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that participants with more prudent diets were more likely to have higher levels of physical activity and less likely to have a smoking history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants with lower levels of reported physical activity and a history of smoking had increased fracture and cardiovascular risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study emphasizes the importance of public health education on dietary and lifestyle choices, particularly as adults reach middle and older age. Taking measures to improve bone health such as focusing on calcium in the diet may provide heart protective benefits as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at Saddleback Medical Center, spoke with &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; about the study findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As an observational study, it is unclear whether this association is causative, or it is confounded by other associated factors like physical activity and hypertension, which are more closely linked to the outcome,” Chen, who was not involved in this research, pointed out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted that “these long-term observational studies are useful in finding associations between multiple factors but less useful in determining actual cause and effect.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/timothy-w-gibson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Timothy Gibson&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon and medical director of the MemorialCare Joint Replacement Center, also gave &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; his thoughts about the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibson, similarly not involve in the research, also emphasized that the study findings demonstrate only an association between prudent diet and fracture risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The evidence from this type of study can show association but not necessarily causation,” commented Gibson. “It can still provide interesting educational information and help with public health guidelines.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibson was surprised that the study did not find a stronger connection between adhering to a more prudent diet and a lower hip fracture risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The dietary data was self-reported and probably one of the least stringent aspects of the study,” he pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://med.uth.edu/internalmedicine/2022/11/17/john-p-higgins-md-mba-hons-mphil-facc-facp-faha-facsm-fasnc-fsgc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;John P. Higgins&lt;/a&gt;, MD, MBA, a sports cardiologist at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth in Houston, shared with &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; some dietary and lifestyle habits people can focus on as they age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are several things you can do and eat that promote both heart health and bone health,” Higgins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, he suggested weight-bearing exercises for both bone and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Walking, jogging, dancing, and weightlifting are excellent for both the heart and bones,” Higgins advised. “These activities help improve cardiovascular health while stimulating bone density, preventing bone loss.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higgins also suggested strength training and participating in stretching and balancing exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kale, spinach, and collard greens are rich in &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/219867" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;vitamin K&lt;/a&gt;, calcium, and other nutrients that support bone health. They also have antioxidants that help reduce inflammation, which benefits the heart.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can also incorporate fatty fish, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and fortified plant milks for bone and heart health. Including dairy or foods high in calcium is also important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By combining heart-healthy foods with bone-strengthening activities, you can support both systems simultaneously,” Higgins advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 06:31:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNbzNMclgwOFZUUUZ2S1RPVGttenJQeFlGalktUWZQS3hMdUlRa1BaZS10YXBhLXBDclk3TXR5TlBTSzVXY2YxYlRkNTJwZHFXR0gwNVFTZktTMkNWc0xjWWVFX0dqaDlhbktOTVlYampfVGRqTzEzWk90TFlPQUFXQTRXeU5rMm5sUmFrSmJpY3d0TjJwcXZiYTFpYk1aOFo5cG9KR1poazFwb1JkaUJqRHpOSlN6OFpY</guid></item><item><title>现在结婚已与痴呆症的风险增加有关 - 独立 | Now being married has been linked to an increased risk of dementia - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQN2RPeG13d21fT2xHRF83Nm5MaUhxN015OHdkOUFKaEN6aFhOUGF0cTczdmtYMGlOaXJ3WWVnNVAzd2lPZWRUeHZ0cF96Q2M5bU9EcFJLSEptbG5TQWtENEVZVEQ2b0dZZzVJTUVGb01mVVFmRXZoSktQU08xWDUzcmltQU5PTDkzZzhHdEQ0djd6Uzc1TkhRS3pHMVhRelVYN09B?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 eWQiqu sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 cGmNxG"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iqSitv"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dlmCG"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 igdyzJ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cPkZJS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 fGzMFb sc-hez36s-16 fJelbS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 fiXggt"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 eSVQSf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 caTeJB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 blUixN"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cfrdoh"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

A new study led by researchers at Florida State University somewhat shockingly suggests that unmarried people are less likely to develop dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think you’ve heard the opposite, you are correct. A 2019 study from America found that unmarried people had “significantly higher odds of developing dementia over the study period than their married counterparts”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, married people are generally thought to have better health. Studies have shown that they are at reduced risk of having heart disease and stroke and they tend to live longer. So why did the new study come up with this surprising finding? Let’s take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed data from more than 24,000 Americans without dementia at the start of the study. Participants were tracked for up to 18 years. Crucially, the team compared dementia rates across marital groups: married, divorced, widowed and never-married.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, it looked as though all three unmarried groups had a reduced risk of dementia compared with the married group. But, after accounting for other factors that could influence the results such as smoking and depression, only divorced and never-married people had a lower risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 lboIER"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/06/09/ed1f7db85835892fe109d2c093c1ee38Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg4NjQ2Njk0-2.50100921.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/06/09/ed1f7db85835892fe109d2c093c1ee38Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg4NjQ2Njk0-2.50100921.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/06/09/ed1f7db85835892fe109d2c093c1ee38Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg4NjQ2Njk0-2.50100921.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A new study led by researchers at Florida State University suggests that unmarried people are less likely to develop dementia" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-13665"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;A new study led by researchers at Florida State University suggests that unmarried people are less likely to develop dementia&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (PA Archive)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differences were also seen depending on the type of dementia. For example, being unmarried was consistently linked with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. But it was not shown for vascular dementia – a rarer form of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that divorced or never-married people were less likely to progress from mild cognitive impairment to dementia and that people who became widowed during the study had a lower risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Possible explanations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason for the unexpected results? Married people might be diagnosed earlier because they have spouses who notice memory problems and push for a doctor’s visit. This could make dementia look more common in married people – even if it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is called ascertainment bias — when data is skewed because of who gets diagnosed or noticed more easily. However, the evidence of this was not strong. All participants had annual visits from a doctor, who could be thought of as a proxy partner who would spot early signs of dementia in the participant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was the case that the sample of people used, from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) study, was not representative of the wider population. Specifically, the sample showed low levels of ethnic and income diversity. Also, nearly 64% of the participants were married. This may affect how these unexpected findings translate to the wider world. They could just have been unique to NACC participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is more likely that these findings highlight just how complex the effects of marital disruptions, transitions and choices on brain health really are. Being married is by no means an established protective factor for dementia, with an earlier meta-analysis (a study of studies) showing mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study from Florida State University uses one of the biggest samples to date to examine this issue, and carries a good deal of weight. It highlights that assumptions based on previous research that widowhood and divorce are very stressful life events that can trigger Alzheimer’s disease or that unmarried people are socially isolated and therefore may be at higher risk of dementia, may not always be correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relationship dynamics are by no means straightforward. As mentioned in the paper, such dynamics may “provide a more nuanced understanding than a simple binary effect”. Factors such as marriage quality, levels of satisfaction after divorce, cultural considerations, or the sociability of single people compared with coupled ones may help explain these seemingly contradictory results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study challenges the idea that marriage is automatically good for brain health.

			&lt;p&gt;Disease forecasts are like weather forecasts: We cannot predict the finer details of a particular outbreak or a particular storm, but we can often identify when these threats are emerging and prepare accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="157871" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; that cause avian  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="157871" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; are potential threats to global health. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/updated-joint-fao-who-woah-assessment-of-recent-influenza-a(h5n1)-virus-events-in-animals-and-people_dec2024"&gt;Recent animal outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; from a subtype called H5N1 have been especially troubling to scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although human infections from H5N1 have been relatively rare, there have been a &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/2021-dha-docs/cumulative-number-of-confirmed-human-cases-for-avian-influenza-a(h5n1)-reported-to-who--2003-2025.pdf"&gt;little more than 900 known cases globally&lt;/a&gt; since 2003 – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMe2416323"&gt;nearly 50 percent of these cases have been fatal&lt;/a&gt; – a mortality rate about &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/jech.2007.064030"&gt;20 times higher&lt;/a&gt; than that of the 1918  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="157871" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="157871" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. If the worst of these rare infections ever became common among people, the results could be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approaching potential disease threats from an anthropological perspective, my colleagues &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ron-Barrett-2"&gt;and I&lt;/a&gt; recently published a book called "&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/emerging-infections-9780192843135"&gt;Emerging Infections: Three Epidemiological Transitions from Prehistory to the Present&lt;/a&gt;" to examine the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/future-pandemics-will-have-the-same-human-causes-as-ancient-outbreaks-lessons-from-anthropology-can-help-prevent-them-224622"&gt;ways human behaviors have shaped&lt;/a&gt; the evolution of infectious diseases, beginning with their first major emergence in the Neolithic period and continuing for 10,000 years to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viewed from this deep time perspective, it becomes evident that H5N1 is displaying a common pattern of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05775"&gt;stepwise invasion&lt;/a&gt; from animal to human populations. Like many emerging viruses, H5N1 is making incremental evolutionary changes that could allow it to transmit between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The periods between these evolutionary steps present opportunities to slow this process and possibly avert a global disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spillover and viral chatter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a disease-causing pathogen such as a flu  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="157871" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; is already adapted to infect a particular animal species, it may eventually evolve the ability to infect a new species, such as humans, through a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-spillover-bird-flu-outbreak-underscores-need-for-early-detection-to-prevent-the-next-big-pandemic-200494"&gt;process called spillover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spillover is a tricky enterprise. To be successful, the pathogen must have the right set of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004129"&gt;molecular "keys"&lt;/a&gt; compatible with the host's molecular "locks" so it can break in and out of host cells and hijack their replication machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because these locks often vary between species, the pathogen may have to try many different keys before it can infect an entirely new host species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the keys a virus successfully uses to infect chickens and ducks may not work on cattle and humans. And because new keys can be made only through random mutation, the odds of obtaining all the right ones are very slim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these evolutionary challenges, it is not surprising that pathogens &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature05775"&gt;often get stuck&lt;/a&gt; partway into the spillover process. A new variant of the pathogen might be transmissible from an animal only to a person who is either &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro.2017.45"&gt;more susceptible&lt;/a&gt; due to preexisting illness or more likely to be infected because of extended exposure to the pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even then, the pathogen might not be able to break out of its human host and transmit to another person. This is the current situation with H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past year, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals"&gt;many animal outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of wild and domestic animals, especially among birds and cattle. But there have also been a small number of human cases, most of which have occurred among &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2414610"&gt;poultry and dairy workers&lt;/a&gt; who worked closely with large numbers of infected animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_157872" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157872" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/PathogenTransmissionCanBeModeledDiagram.jpg" alt="Diagram showing pathogen transmission occurs in three stages" class="wp-image-157872 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/PathogenTransmissionCanBeModeledDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/PathogenTransmissionCanBeModeledDiagram-600x224.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-157872" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Pathogen transmission can be modeled in three stages. In Stage 1, the pathogen can be transmitted only between nonhuman animals. In stage 2, the pathogen can also be transmitted to humans, but it is not yet adapted for human-to-human transmission. In Stage 3, the pathogen is fully capable of human-to-human transmission. (Ron Barrett/CC BY-SA)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologists call this situation &lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250012210/theviralstorm/"&gt;viral chatter&lt;/a&gt;: when human infections occur only in small, sporadic outbreaks that appear like the chattering signals of coded radio communications – tiny bursts of unclear information that may add up to a very ominous message. In the case of viral chatter, the message would be a human pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sporadic, individual cases of H5N1 among people suggest that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2024.101416"&gt;human-to-human transmission&lt;/a&gt; may likely occur at some point. But even so, no one knows how long or how many steps it would take for this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza viruses evolve rapidly. This is partly because two or more flu varieties can infect the same host simultaneously, allowing them to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2017.0141"&gt;reshuffle their genetic material with one another&lt;/a&gt; to produce entirely new varieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These reshuffling events are more likely to occur when there is a diverse range of host species. So it is particularly concerning that H5N1 is known to have infected &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44358-024-00008-7"&gt;at least 450 different animal species&lt;/a&gt;. It may not be long before the viral chatter gives way to larger human epidemics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reshaping the trajectory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that people can take basic measures to slow down the evolution of H5N1 and potentially reduce the lethality of avian influenza should it ever become a common human infection. But governments and businesses will need to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can start by taking better care of food animals. The &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wild-mammals-birds-biomass"&gt;total weight of the world's poultry&lt;/a&gt; is greater than all wild bird species combined. So it is not surprising that the geography of most &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2007.00699.x"&gt;H5N1 outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; track more closely with large-scale housing and international transfers of live poultry than with the nesting and migration patterns of wild aquatic birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing these agricultural practices could help curb the evolution and spread of H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can also take better care of themselves. At the individual level, most people can vaccinate against the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03721-24"&gt;common, seasonal influenza viruses&lt;/a&gt; that circulate every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance this practice may not seem connected to the emergence of avian influenza. But in addition to preventing seasonal illness, vaccination against common human varieties of the virus will reduce the odds of it mixing with avian varieties and giving them the traits they need for human-to-human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the population level, societies can work together to &lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/emerging-infections-9780192843135"&gt;improve nutrition and sanitation&lt;/a&gt; in the world's poorest populations. History has shown that better nutrition increases overall resistance to new infections, and better sanitation reduces how much and how often people are exposed to new pathogens. And in today's interconnected world, the disease problems of any society &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/126795"&gt;will eventually spread&lt;/a&gt; to every society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than 10,000 years, human behaviors have shaped the evolutionary trajectories of infectious diseases. Knowing this, people can reshape these trajectories for the better.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/250232/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Cartoons exaggerated it to mock politicians. In rural settings, it was once considered a status symbol - a sign that "this man eats well".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But what was once dismissed or even celebrated is now raising alarm bells. The obesity crisis in India is ballooning - and the seemingly harmless pot belly may be a far bigger villain than we think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;India had the second-highest number of overweight or obese adults in 2021, with 180 million affected - behind only China. A &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00355-1/fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;new Lancet study&lt;/a&gt; warns this number could soar to 450 million by 2050, nearly a third of the country's projected population.&lt;b id="" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Globally, more than half of all adults and a third of children and adolescents are expected to face the same fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the heart of this issue in India lies the pot belly, or in medical terms, abdominal obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This form of obesity refers to the accumulation of excess fat around the belly and doctors say it's more than a cosmetic concern.

According to the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) -  which, for the first time, measured waist and hip sizes - about &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37492420/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;40% of women and 12% of men &lt;/a&gt;in India have abdominal obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Abdominal obesity, based on Indian guidelines, means a waist over 90cm (35 inches) for men and 80cm (31 inches) for women. Among women aged 30 to 49, nearly one in two already show signs of it. Urban populations were found to be more affected than rural ones, with high waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratios emerging as a key red flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So why is belly fat such a big deal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One reason is insulin resistance - a condition where the body stops responding properly to insulin, the hormone that helps regulate blood sugar. Abdominal fat disrupts how the body uses insulin, making it harder to control blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000812" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Studies &lt;/a&gt;have found South Asians, including Indians, tend to have more body fat than white Caucasians at the same Body Mass Index. (BMI is a simple measure of body fat based on a person's weight in relation to their height.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It's not just how much fat you have - it's where it goes. In South Asians, fat tends to collect around the trunk and under the skin, but not always deep in the abdomen as visceral fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Though South Asians may have less of the more harmful deep abdominal fat around organs like the liver and pancreas, studies show their larger, less efficient fat cells struggle to store fat under the skin. As a result, excess fat spills into vital organs that regulate metabolism - like the liver and pancreas - raising the risk of diabetes and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2013/live/0bf7e950-16ba-11f0-9d62-c588eb0bf8fe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2013/live/0bf7e950-16ba-11f0-9d62-c588eb0bf8fe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2013/live/0bf7e950-16ba-11f0-9d62-c588eb0bf8fe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2013/live/0bf7e950-16ba-11f0-9d62-c588eb0bf8fe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2013/live/0bf7e950-16ba-11f0-9d62-c588eb0bf8fe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2013/live/0bf7e950-16ba-11f0-9d62-c588eb0bf8fe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2013/live/0bf7e950-16ba-11f0-9d62-c588eb0bf8fe.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2013/live/0bf7e950-16ba-11f0-9d62-c588eb0bf8fe.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt='Reuters A woman walks past a billboard in Mumbai April 19, 2007.

Though numerous genetic studies have been conducted, no single gene has consistently explained this tendency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One theory offers an evolutionary root. India, for centuries, was wracked by famines and chronic food shortages, leaving generations to survive on meagre nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In such conditions, the human body adapted for survival in extreme scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The body needed a depot for this energy and the abdomen, being the most expandable area, became the prime storage site. Over time, as food became more plentiful, this fat store continued to grow -  eventually to harmful levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's a conjectural but plausible evolutionary theory - one that can't be proven, but makes sense," says Anoop Misra, who heads Delhi's Fortis-C-DOC Centre of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Last year, in a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187140212400050X?via%3Dihub" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;paper &lt;/a&gt;doctors belonging to the Indian Obesity Commission redefined obesity guidelines for Asian Indians, moving beyond BMI to better reflect how body fat relates to early health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They created a two-stage clinical system that considers fat distribution, related diseases and physical function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Stage one involves a high BMI, but without abdominal obesity, metabolic disease, or physical dysfunction. In such cases, lifestyle changes like diet, exercise and sometimes medication are usually enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Stage two includes abdominal obesity - the harmful visceral fat -  and is often accompanied by health issues like diabetes, knee pain or palpitations.

Once belly fat appears, early action is key - new weight loss drugs like semaglutide and tirzepatide are proving effective at targeting it, doctors say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"As shocking as it may sound, even people with a normal weight can have dangerous levels of belly fat," says Dr Misra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Indian physicians say abdominal obesity is rising due to lifestyle changes - more junk food, takeaways, instant meals and greasy home cooking. Between 2009 and 2019, Cameroon, India and Vietnam saw the fastest growth in per capita sales of ultra-processed foods and beverages, studies found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So, what needs to be done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Experts say Indians need tougher lifestyle changes than Western norms recommend. While 150 minutes of weekly exercise may suffice for their European men, their South Asians counterparts need around 250–300 minutes to offset slower metabolism and less efficient fat storage, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/archiveofnews/2013/december/headline_299351_en.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Our bodies simply aren't as good at handling excess fat," says Dr Misra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In short, the pot belly isn't just a punchline - it's a warning sign.

&lt;p&gt;We’re currently living through a moment in time when GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Mounjaro are transforming our expectations about diabetes, weight loss and fitness. But there’s another large question looming overhead when it comes to these medications: can they sustain weight loss in the long term? While it isn’t quite an existential question for the health care industry, it has prompted some pushback from &lt;a href="https://www.insidehook.com/television/bill-maher-real-time-jillian-michaels-ozempic"&gt;skeptics&lt;/a&gt; of the drugs’ long-term safety. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a new study, people taking Mounjaro (aka tirzepatide) have some cause for relief. &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;‘s Nicola Davis recently &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/11/people-using-drug-mounjaro-sustain-weight-loss-over-three-years-trial-finds"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on the results of a study that is set to be presented at this year’s &lt;a href="https://easo.org/congress/"&gt;European Congress on Obesity&lt;/a&gt;. The study encompassed around 700 people, who were divided into three groups based on the amount of tirzepatide that they were given.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among the researchers’ findings, Davis writes, were that participants in the groups lost, on average, 9.2%, 20.2% and 30.8% of their body weight, depending on which group they were in. The scientists conducting the study observed that participants took an average of 22 months to reach their lowest weight. And the majority of participants lost almost 20% of their starting weight over the course of three years.&lt;/p&gt; 



	




&lt;p&gt;There are some caveats here: for starters, &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;‘s reporting notes that the study was not peer reviewed. But these results are nonetheless encouraging for people concerned about the long-term effects of this medication — and whether promising initial results can be sustained over time.&lt;/p&gt;

He says the combination of high fiber and probiotics in this food supports digestion, colon health and lowers inflammation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Natto can be particularly beneficial for individuals with digestive issues like bloating, constipation or inflammatory bowel diseases because its probiotics and fiber help regulate gut function,” Dr. Patel says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He adds that people with metabolic disorders such as diabetes or obesity may also benefit from incorporating natto into their diet due to its ability to improve gut microbiota and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/game-changing-gut-health-tip-100000374.html" data-ylk="slk:The Game-Changing Gut Health Tip We Wish We Knew About Earlier;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;The Game-Changing Gut Health Tip We Wish We Knew About Earlier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Natto isn’t just beneficial for gut health. Dr. Patel says that due to its vitamin K2 content, it also supports &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36033779/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bone health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8596038" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;. The high fiber content in natto is another reason why it’s a heart-healthy food. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3898422" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientific research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Scientific research shows&lt;/a&gt; that a diet high in fiber is linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Dr. Patel, part of what makes natto such a great food for gut health is how versatile it is. While it may not be something you've heard of, natto can be purchased at most major grocery stories! He says that some ways to use natto include adding it to steamed rice alongside miso soup and pickled vegetables, using it as a filling in sushi rolls, as a topping for noodles like udon or ramen, or pairing it with other fermented foods, such as kimchi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Another Overlooked Food That’s Good for Your Gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Natto isn’t the only surprising food that supports gut health. &lt;a href="https://www.ganjllc.com/physician/andrew-s-boxer-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Andrew Boxer, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Andrew Boxer, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;a gastroenterologist at Gastroenterology Associates of New Jersey, says that many people don’t know that kiwi is majorly good for the gut. “Kiwi is an underrated powerhouse for gut health. While many people think of yogurt or fiber supplements, kiwi is a natural digestive aid that deserves more attention,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Boxer explains that the reason why kiwi is so beneficial for gut health is that it’s rich in soluble fiber, which promotes regularity without excessive bloating. “It also contains actinidin, an enzyme that helps break down proteins, making digestion smoother,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you have irritable bowel syndrome, Dr. Boxer says it can be especially beneficial to integrate kiwi into your diet because the fruit can help improve stool consistency and frequency. He adds that people who deal with constipation regularly or sluggish digestion (which is more common with age) can also benefit from adding kiwi to their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While kiwi tastes delicious on its own, Dr. Boxer says that some ways of integrating the fruit into your meals include using it in smoothies and topping off your yogurt or oatmeal with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Whether you want to experiment with natto, eat more kiwi or simply aim to eat more fiber-rich and probiotic-rich foods, your entire body will benefit.

Two main theories compete: materialism, which sees thoughts as brain states, and dualism, which holds that thoughts are non-physical entities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While neuroscience has mapped correlations between brain activity and mental states, it cannot yet explain how physical matter gives rise to conscious experience. Thought experiments like Mary and the color room highlight the potential limits of physical explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If dualism is true, machine consciousness may remain elusive. Understanding the nature of thought could redefine how we view minds—both human and artificial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Materialism vs. Dualism:&lt;/strong&gt; Thought may be either a product of brain activity (materialism) or something beyond the physical (dualism).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Color Room Argument:&lt;/strong&gt; The famous thought experiment suggests there are non-physical aspects to conscious experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Whether machines can truly think depends on whether thought is physical or non-physical.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;The Conversation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can doubt just about anything. But there’s one thing you can know for sure: you are having thoughts right now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea came to characterise the philosophical thinking of 17th century philosopher René Descartes. For Descartes, that we have thoughts may be the only thing we can be certain about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what exactly are thoughts? This is a mystery that has long troubled philosophers such as Descartes – and which has been given new life by the rise of artificial intelligence, as experts try to figure out whether machines can genuinely think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Two schools of thought&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main answers to the philosophical question of what thoughts are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first is that thoughts might be material things. Thoughts are just like atoms, particles, cats, clouds and raindrops: part and parcel of the physical universe. This position is known as physicalism or materialism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second view is that thoughts might stand apart from the physical world. They are not like atoms, but are an entirely distinct type of thing. This view is called dualism, because it takes the world to have a dual nature: mental and physical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand the difference between these views, consider a thought experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose God is building the world from scratch. If physicalism is true, then all God needs to do to produce thoughts is build the basic physical components of reality – the fundamental particles – and put in place the laws of nature. Thoughts should follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if dualism is true, then putting in place the basic laws and physical components of reality will not produce thoughts. Some non-physical aspects of reality will need to be added, as thoughts are something over and above all physical components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why be a materialist?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If thoughts are physical, what physical things are they? One plausible answer is they are brain states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This answer underpins much of contemporary neuroscience and psychology. Indeed, it is the apparent link between brains and thoughts that makes materialism seem plausible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many correlations between our brain states and our thoughts. Certain parts of the brain predictably “light up” when someone is in pain, or if they think about the past or future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus, located near the brain stem, appears to be linked to imaginative and creative thought, while the Broca’s area in the left hemisphere appears to be linked to speech and language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why be a dualist?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the correlations between brain states and thoughts are just that: correlations. We don’t have an explanation of how brain states – or any physical states for that matter – give rise to conscious thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a well-known correlation between striking a match and the match lighting. But in addition to the correlation, we also have an explanation for why the match is lit when struck. The friction causes a chemical reaction in the match head, which leads to a release of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have no comparable explanation for a link between thoughts and brain states. After all, there seem to be many physical things that don’t have thoughts. We have no idea why brain states give rise to thoughts and chairs don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The colour scientist&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing we are most certain about – that we have thoughts – is still completely unexplained in physical terms. That’s not for a lack of effort. Neuroscience, philosophy, cognitive science and psychology have all been hard at work trying to crack this mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it gets worse: we may never be able to explain how thoughts arise from neural states. To understand why, consider this &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2026143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;famous thought experiment&lt;/a&gt; by Australian philosopher Frank Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary lives her entire life in a black-and-white room. She has never experienced colour. However, she also has access to a computer which contains a complete account of every physical aspect of the universe, including all the physical and neurological details of experiencing colour. She learns all of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, Mary leaves the room and experiences colour for the first time. Does she learn anything new?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is very tempting to think she does: she learns what it’s like to experience colour. But remember, Mary already knew every physical fact about the universe. So if she learns something new, it must be some non-physical fact. Moreover, the fact she learns comes through experience, which means there must be some non-physical aspect to experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think Mary learns something new by leaving the room, you must accept dualism to be true in some form. And if that’s the case, then we can’t provide an explanation of thought in terms of the brain’s functions, or so philosophers have argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Minds and machines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Settling the question of what thoughts are won’t completely settle the question of whether machines can think, but it would help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If thoughts are physical, then there’s no reason, in principle, why machines couldn’t think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If thoughts are not physical, however, it’s less clear whether machines could think. Would it be possible to get them “hooked up” to the non-physical in the right way? This would depend on how non-physical thoughts relate to the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, pursuing the question of what thoughts are will likely have significant implications for how we think about machine intelligence, and our place in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this cognition and consciousness research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/sam-baron-328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sam Baron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sam Baron – The Conversation&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 21:11:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5hNVlVVm9wRnpGRUZ1ZEw0dks4UUV1cUgyM2pnSHB4cHFiWmJLM2xXQ1lmN0pfWmN3bGlDMWtVOTNtNkt4cnh2UEFnTm9VR01xblNvVFE5cWowSTN1bGNpSUpQS0JmUHlaOUpUWDhISG56TzEwSUpqRWtIQQ</guid></item><item><title>症状发作：妄想通常出现在早期精神病中的幻觉之前。 - 神经科学新闻 | Symptom Onset: Delusions often appear before hallucinations in early psychosis. - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE45SmVlclV1SVNBNkVmSnNjRkVuQm9wMW1uMy0zQXRyV3Z0Rm9Pd0IzdVF5LUhpZUhrcDFselBMVUJXbHZGN1NTVW9obk5CRUlCMWpmYjVQRnBGdm5fWTRXVE5WOWRvbS1CbVFxcEw1dmF0ZkNyNnhZc1FR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study has found that delusions typically emerge before hallucinations in individuals at high risk for psychosis, overturning a long-standing belief that hallucinations drive delusional thinking. By analyzing symptom progression across three large cohorts, researchers consistently observed that delusions were the earliest symptom, reappearing even before hallucinations during relapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that disruptions in how the brain processes prediction errors may underlie delusions, with hallucinations emerging as a secondary effect. These insights may lead to earlier intervention strategies and better prevention of full-blown psychotic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptom Onset:&lt;/strong&gt; Delusions often appear before hallucinations in early psychosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Processing:&lt;/strong&gt; Psychosis may stem from the brain misinterpreting prediction errors, leading to distorted beliefs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding symptom progression opens the door to preventive treatments targeting brain hyperexcitability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Yale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patients with psychosis have a disrupted connection to reality, often suffering from delusions and hallucinations. These symptoms have been thought to arise from the same brain processes, but a new Yale study upends this long-held belief.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study examined the natural progression of delusions and hallucinations in two large groups of adolescents and young adults in the earliest stages of psychosis—that is, individuals who experience these symptoms but not at the severity typically seen in fully-formed psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see whether their findings were also observed in those who did develop the disease, the researchers also included a sample of individuals experiencing their first episode of psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across these groups, the authors observed a consistent pattern in which delusions appeared before hallucinations. Even more striking, this same pattern was seen when symptoms disappeared and came back: Delusions re-emerged before hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study were recently published in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were interested in understanding how delusions and hallucinations start and develop over time, because that could give us important hints as to where these symptoms come from in the first place,” says Albert Powers, MD, PhD, associate professor of psychiatry and the study’s senior author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We looked at what we call the prodromal stage, when symptoms are just beginning to emerge. No one has been able to examine symptom emergence in so many people this early in the illness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are delusions and hallucinations?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delusions and hallucinations both disrupt a person’s perception of reality, but they are distinct symptoms of psychosis. Delusions are fixed, often bizarre beliefs that persist despite clear contradictory evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, a person might believe they are the devil,” explains Powers. “And there is very little you could say to convince them otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hallucinations, on the other hand, involve perceiving things that aren’t actually present in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s nothing around you, and yet you see or hear it,” Powers explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most research has studied delusions and hallucinations once they are fully formed. However, these symptoms often unfold gradually over time, over an average of 22 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delusions may begin subtly, with a growing sense of suspicion or unease. Similarly, hallucinations might first appear as heightened sensations or vague sounds like static or indistinct murmurs, which can eventually develop into clearly perceived voices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This slow progression ultimately culminates in the onset of psychosis in around 20% of those presenting these early symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powers recalls that during his medical training, delusions and hallucinations were typically treated as a single category, largely because they often responded to the same medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they were considered separately, it was often hypothesized that delusions may develop as an attempt to make sense of hallucinations. For instance, if someone hears the sound of footsteps behind them, they might come to believe that FBI agents are following them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You might expect that hallucinations would come first because they create a need for explanation,” says Powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why do I keep hearing people behind me all the time? Well, it’s because someone is after me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that hypothesis seems intuitive, the new study reveals a surprising twist: Delusions typically emerge before hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In psychosis, delusions most often arise before hallucinations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, the researchers analyzed data from three large cohorts. Two of the datasets came from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study, which consisted of individuals identified as being at high risk for developing psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third dataset was drawn from the Montreal-based Prevention Program for Psychosis, which included participants experiencing their first psychotic episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When people enrolled in these studies, clinicians assessed their symptoms—how severe they were, when they started, and how often they happened,” says Powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But until now, no one had systematically examined which symptoms were most likely to start first.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all three datasets, researchers found that most participants experienced both early delusions and hallucinations. However, among those who presented only one symptom, delusions were more common. Furthermore, individuals who experienced both were more likely to report that delusions appeared before hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also followed symptom changes during periods of remission. Interestingly, the pattern appeared to reverse—participants typically experienced the disappearance of hallucinations before delusions. Then, if their symptoms reemerged, patients were once again more likely to report that delusions emerged before hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Hallucinations may be the brain’s attempt to compensate for drivers of delusions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these findings may seem surprising, they fit with a set of emerging theories in psychiatry based on computational neuroscience. These theories suggest that delusions may arise from disruptions in how people learn about the world. This process centered on what is known as “predictive processing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a person experiences something that doesn’t match their expectations about the world, this prompts the brain to revise its expectations—it learns. For example, as a person arrives at work, they might expect their computer to turn on, as it does each morning. If one day the screen fails to light up, this is a violation of their expectation—a prediction error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When a prediction that you have about the world is violated, this tells your brain to form a new belief or update its current beliefs about what is going on in the world,” says Powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This helps us keep up with the world and predict what’s going on around us. Predictions and prediction errors drive that process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the earlier example, the person at work might form a new belief that their computer is dysfunctional or unplugged, leading them to check the power or consider taking it in for repairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In individuals with psychosis, dysfunction in one of the brain’s neurotransmitter systems can lead to hyperexcitability of the cerebral cortex, which could inject noise into the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, in turn, could drive inappropriate learning via prediction errors not tied to a new state of the world, but to this noisiness. This would then lead to the formation of beliefs that don’t conform to reality, or delusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a person might misinterpret an insignificant or coincidental event, such as witnessing two people conversing, as something new and more personally significant, like believing they are secretly talking about the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As prediction errors become excessive, individuals might begin to distrust the information they’re receiving from the world around them because it is tainted with noise. Hallucinations can arise when individuals begin trusting their expectations more than incoming sensory information—and thus start perceiving things that aren’t actually there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This disconnect would cause them to conclude that something is around them, even though the sensory information doesn’t say it is,” Powers explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, the noise that drives delusion formation could also make the brain distrust new information after some time, leading to hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Research could lead to psychosis prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By studying how psychotic symptoms form and evolve, Powers hopes psychiatrists can move toward preventing psychosis, rather than just managing it once it appears. Current treatments primarily target symptoms without addressing the underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you go to a psychiatrist, we focus on alleviating symptoms that cause problems in your life,” Powers says. “In the future, we want to stop the process that leads to symptoms in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He points to cardiology as a model: Cardiologists treat heart attacks but also work to prevent them by addressing the root causes, such as high cholesterol or hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychiatry, he says, lacks comparable preventative tools—but he envisions that changing. If hyperexcitability in the cerebral cortex is indeed driving delusions and hallucinations, then it may be possible to intervene earlier, before psychosis takes hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And there are drugs that do this,” says Powers. “They’re experimental right now, but they manage to decrease hyperexcitability of the cortex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are currently testing whether these medications can effectively treat early signs of psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powers believes that understanding how the brain misinterprets sensory data has implications far beyond psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the first glimpses at what a pathophysiological model in psychiatry might look like,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how psychotic symptoms develop could help us understand how this could happen in other psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, PTSD, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. All of these conditions affect the way we learn about the world and act upon it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, his team plans to analyze electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging data to try to identify biomarkers of psychosis. “Our next step is to study the actual brain data and see if we can catch the signatures of symptom emergence itself,” Powers says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (awards R01MH129721 and R01MH131768). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.

However, recent evidence suggests they may be driven by distinct computational and neural mechanisms. Examining the time course of their emergence may provide insights into the relationship between these underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants from the second (N = 719) and third (N = 699) iterations of the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS 2,3) were assessed for timing of CHR-P-level delusion and hallucination onset. Pre-onset symptom patterns in first-episode psychosis patients (FEP) from the Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychosis (PEPP-Montréal; N = 694) were also assessed. Symptom onset was determined at baseline assessment and the evolution of symptom patterns examined over 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all three samples, participants were more likely to report the onset of attenuated/subthreshold delusions prior to attenuated/subthreshold hallucinations (odds ratios (OR): NAPLS 2=4.09; NAPLS 3=4.14; PEPP, Z=7.01, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and to present with only attenuated/subthreshold delusions compared to only attenuated/subthreshold hallucinations (OR: NAPLS 2=5.6; NAPLS 3=11.11; PEPP=42.75).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Re-emergence of attenuated/subthreshold delusions after remission was also more common than re-emergence of attenuated/subthreshold hallucinations (&lt;em&gt;Ps &amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt; 0.05), which more often resolved first (&lt;em&gt;Ps&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In both CHR-P samples, ratings of delusional ideation fell with the onset of attenuated hallucinations (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attenuated/subthreshold delusions tend to emerge before attenuated/subthreshold hallucinations and may play a role in their development. Further work should examine the relationship between the mechanisms driving these symptoms and its utility for diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 20:41:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE45SmVlclV1SVNBNkVmSnNjRkVuQm9wMW1uMy0zQXRyV3Z0Rm9Pd0IzdVF5LUhpZUhrcDFselBMVUJXbHZGN1NTVW9obk5CRUlCMWpmYjVQRnBGdm5fWTRXVE5WOWRvbS1CbVFxcEw1dmF0ZkNyNnhZc1FR</guid></item><item><title>NBC新闻新闻 | North Carolina flu-related deaths at all-time high - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNbVFIRktlaDBTUDJSd3pySF8wc2JsRHVwbUc5YThXTlV0d0JqRG1RMjZ6Nzhja29tUThVU290R05XNlh1N2N4dExBZnhyZ2JNRmpHQlV5NGFTaWpxQTRHLUxOYUdvZDgyZEQyYVBQUl9iZkhIVEdrcTdNYVRQZy1FREV6WmpfOWZnRENpb3MzSVljc3NKNUktRmpmTdIBVkFVX3lxTE1QWG5LX3dqb1p3R2haN2lFcXFud20wdzFESE9iM29vbUIxSkxubGdnVmN5WV9kTEV1NWxDUmhXOW44ZTRfQ3pOcktOZE9Cd2tLU3k2UTBn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;North Carolina has reported a record number of flu deaths this respiratory virus season, health officials said this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;More than 500 flu-related deaths were reported for the 2024-25 respiratory virus season, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services said in a Wednesday press release.

They include conditions such as intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and motor disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These NDDs, which often have a genetic basis, manifest in early childhood and can lead to lifelong challenges in learning, behavior, and communication. The current findings involve a newly discovered form of NDD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know from years of experience supporting patients and families with rare genetic conditions how receiving a diagnosis like this can be life-changing and the first step on the journey to putting in place the right support and care,” says Sarah Wynn, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Unique, an organization that provides support, information, and a voice for all those affected by rare chromosome or gene disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advances in genetic sequencing, including whole-genome sequencing of more than 50,000 individuals by Genomics England, made the development possible. This enabled the researchers to identify the cause of the novel disorder as mutations in&lt;em&gt; RNU2-2&lt;/em&gt;, a gene once thought to be inactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also identified a separate mutation in &lt;em&gt;RNU2-2&lt;/em&gt; that tends to arise in unaffected individuals as they age, which may have implications for age-related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We estimate that the prevalence of &lt;em&gt;RNU2-2&lt;/em&gt; disorder is approximately 20 percent that of &lt;em&gt;RNU4-2&lt;/em&gt; / ReNU syndrome, one of the most common monogenic types of NDD. This means there must be thousands of affected families worldwide,” says senior study author Ernest Turro, PhD, Associate Professor of Genetics and Genomic Sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With a genetic diagnosis in hand, families can connect with others in similar situations, share valuable experiences, and gain a better understanding of how to manage the condition. This discovery also makes possible further research to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the disorder,” says Dr. Turro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c3a8a2b1aaadeda6b0a8a6ada2b9aa83aeb0b0aeeda6a7b6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Karin Eskenazi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mssm.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Karin Eskenazi – Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41588-025-02159-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mutations in the snRNA gene RNU2-2 cause a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with prominent epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;” by Daniel Greene et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutations in the snRNA gene RNU2-2 cause a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with prominent epilepsy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major spliceosome includes five small nuclear RNA (snRNAs), U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6, each of which is encoded by multiple genes. We recently showed that mutations in &lt;em&gt;RNU4-&lt;/em&gt;2, the gene that encodes the U4-2 snRNA, cause one of the most prevalent monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report that recurrent germline mutations in &lt;em&gt;RNU2-2&lt;/em&gt; (previously known as pseudogene &lt;em&gt;RNU2-2P&lt;/em&gt;), a 191-bp gene that encodes the U2-2 snRNA, are responsible for a related disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By genetic association, we identified recurrent de novo single-nucleotide mutations at nucleotide positions 4 and 35 of &lt;em&gt;RNU2-2&lt;/em&gt; in nine cases. We replicated this finding in 16 additional cases, bringing the total to 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We estimate that &lt;em&gt;RNU2-2&lt;/em&gt; syndrome has a prevalence of ~20% that of &lt;em&gt;RNU4-2&lt;/em&gt; syndrome. The disorder is characterized by intellectual disability, autistic behavior, microcephaly, hypotonia, epilepsy and hyperventilation. All cases display a severe and complex seizure phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that U2-2 and canonical U2-1 were similarly expressed in blood. Despite mutant U2-2 being expressed in patient blood samples, we found no evidence of missplicing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings cement the role of major spliceosomal snRNAs in the etiologies of neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 20:19:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5kN1ROX0VlQTdaamtFWUl6VkRveDBiR2ZyeXBvM1pVNjBJa1dsdWd2aTd4b2FaYVRLajNIN2F6cFRsd1VaOUVqbjdJb0tBZHpGbkdGWE8xNnpUdWRaSzlpV0ZYOU01Y0pVWGd0Rk4zYkpfR05FUzcw</guid></item><item><title>这个简单的技巧可以帮助您在嘈杂的房间 -  ScienceAlert听到更好的声音 | This Simple Trick Could Help You Hear Better in a Noisy Room - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQbkxGdzJLZlAxTnZxcTcxV21nS2d3OXNMb24wbUVjMDQtVUhiYWFaMzQ5cXpqbTAzeWRDcjBYU1NoUEZKZHQ3c3VnVFRsOV9IcjZ5Y1YzeGZ6V0xaRGNXanRiNmxWU3NOLUx2X093MXpZa05tU1ZfR004TGNWT0FLUGJpcnE2S01BMWUxZW80elBIaHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had trouble &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-found-a-way-to-boost-human-hearing-in-noisy-situations"&gt;taking in information&lt;/a&gt; in a noisy environment? A new study suggests that tapping your fingers in a steady rhythm could help you 'tune in' through the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers designed a series of experiments to uncover the role of movement in understanding speech, "building on the theory that the motor system is not merely an executor of movements," they &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2025.0354"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;, "but actively contributes to the integration and reuse of temporal information."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study participants, who were all native French speakers, listened to recordings of a person reading 40 sentences from a designated list, made more difficult to comprehend because of background noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by &lt;span&gt;psycholinguist Noémie te Rietmolen&lt;/span&gt; from Aix-Marseille University in France, ran three different experiments in this study, but the central findings came out of Experiment 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time a participant began a 'block' of audio comprehension they were instructed to 'prime' themselves before listening by either: tapping their finger rhythmically at their own pace; tapping along to a provided beat; listening (without tapping) to the beat; or simply waiting in silence for the talking to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then assessed how well the participants took in information from the recordings, in terms of accuracy and speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who had been primed with a physical beat prior to listening to the sentences – either tapping at their own pace or in time to an audio beat – were significantly better at identifying the words they heard in the sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;These findings provide evidence for the functional role of the motor system in processing the temporal dynamics of naturalistic speech," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2025.0354"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you're struggling to hear your date over the rowdy table next to you at the restaurant, why not give it a try?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2025.0354"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Society B&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The milk is sourced from about &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/connection-ss-beneficial-butter-september-2023.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:400 local farms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;400 local farms&lt;/a&gt; with grass-fed cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Is Kirkland Signature Grass-Fed Butter Made?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The milk for Kirkland's butter is collected daily from the farms and then shipped to the Westland Milk Products factory. From there, it's pasteurized, separated, chilled, and churned using the Fritz churn method, a time-honored, hands-on traditional European method of &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/different-types-of-butter/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:making butter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;making butter&lt;/a&gt;. During churning, the fat content of the cream doubles, creating a smooth consistency in the quality and taste of the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Does Grass-Fed Really Mean?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tony C French / Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/What-is-grass-fed-meat" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:According to the USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;According to the USDA&lt;/a&gt;, grass- or forage-fed means the animal’s diet solely consists of grass and the cows cannot be fed grain or grain byproducts. The cows are also required to have continuous access to pasture during the growing season. Globally, no regulations currently exist for the percentage of grass that must make up a cow’s diet in order to label their products as grass-fed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is Grass-Fed Butter Better for You?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In moderation, grass-fed butter does contain more potential benefits in a balanced diet. Hamish Yates, general manager of sales and marketing at Westland Milk Products states that the butter is a good source of vitamin A and contains considerable levels of fatty acids that may help reduce body fat and build muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies align with Yates, showing that milk from grass-fed cows tends to be higher in omega-3 fatty acids. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28362343/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:One study in particular;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;One study in particular&lt;/a&gt; put it at more than 25 percent higher than regular butter.

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Parkinson’s is a progressive neurological condition in which nerve cells in the brain are lost over time. This leads to a reduction of the chemical dopamine which plays an important part in controlling movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This new test, which the Times reports costs £80, analyses small pieces of genetic material known as transfer RNA fragments (tRFs) in the blood, focusing on a repetitive RNA sequence that accumulates in Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It also looks at a parallel decline in mitochondrial RNA, which deteriorates as the disease progresses. Mitochondria exist inside cells and generate energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;By measuring the ratio between these biomarkers, researchers said the test “offers a highly accurate, non-invasive, rapid and affordable diagnostic tool, providing hope for early interventions and treatments that could change the course of the disease”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On a scale where a score of 1 indicates a perfect test while 0.5 shows the test is no better than flipping a coin, the test scored 0.86, the Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The best clinical tests presently used on patients showing early signs of the disease scored 0.73, according to the study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00851-z?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_source=commission_junction&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CONR_PF018_ECOM_GL_PBOK_ALWYS_DEEPLINK&amp;amp;utm_content=textlink&amp;amp;utm_term=PID1612532&amp;amp;CJEVENT=747e1c9817a211f0827c006b0a18b8f6&amp;amp;countryCode=de#Sec1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The test uses the same PCR technology used during the pandemic to confirm Covid cases.

Studies have shown that married individuals are less likely to suffer from &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/pecans-found-to-improve-cholesterol-diet-quality-and-lower-heart-disease-risk/"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and stroke, and they often live well into old age. This pattern has been explained by what's called the marital resource model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to this idea, marriage provides emotional, social, and financial support, all of which contribute to better health and possibly sharper thinking as people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if that belief doesn’t hold up when it comes to dementia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A surprising new study led by Selin Karakose, PhD, at &lt;a href="https://www.fsu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Florida State University&lt;/a&gt;, flips the script. Using data from more than 24,000 older adults followed for up to 18 years, researchers found that married individuals actually had a higher risk of developing dementia than those who were never married, divorced, or widowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Marriage provides emotional, social, and financial support, all of which contribute to better health.

Some studies also linked widowhood and divorce with greater dementia risk. But the evidence has never been clear. One meta-analysis suggested that widowhood — not divorce — was associated with a significantly higher risk. Other research reported no real differences at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest findings suggest something very different. People who had never married were 40% less likely to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-blood-test-accurately-predicts-dementia-risk-a-decade-early/"&gt;develop dementia&lt;/a&gt; than those who were married. Divorced individuals had a 34% lower risk, and widowed people showed a 27% drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers come from initial models that adjusted only for age and sex. After accounting for other factors — including genetics, education, and health conditions — the risk for widowed individuals was no longer statistically significant. But the reduced risk remained for divorced and never-married adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, published in &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;, call into question the long-held idea that marriage guards against memory loss. Karakose and her team suggest that being unmarried might actually offer benefits when it comes to brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_closer_look_at_dementia_types"&gt;A closer look at dementia types&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all dementia is the same. In this study, researchers didn’t just lump all forms together. They broke them down into specific types: Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over nearly four years of follow-up, 4,853 participants were diagnosed with dementia. Most of them — 3,729 people — had &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/natural-dietary-supplement-proven-effective-against-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. A smaller number developed Lewy body dementia (341), vascular dementia (246), or frontotemporal dementia (184).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Cox proportional hazards regression results of marital status predicting AD, LBD, VD, FTLD.

There were no significant associations for vascular dementia or frontotemporal dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important finding: Unmarried individuals were less likely to progress from mild &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/discoveries/it-is-now-possible-to-predict-cognitive-decline-in-alzheimers-disease-study-finds/"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; — or MCI — to full-blown dementia. That held true across all three unmarried groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="what_could_explain_this_"&gt;What could explain this?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possibility is diagnosis timing. Married individuals often have spouses who spot changes in memory or behavior and push them to see a doctor. This could lead to earlier dementia diagnoses in married people — making it seem as if their risk is higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all participants in this study were evaluated annually by trained professionals at &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.gov/taking-action/national-research-centers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers&lt;/a&gt;. These centers use neuropsychological tests and clinical exams to assess cognitive status. That setup might cancel out the so-called ascertainment bias — the idea that some groups are more likely to be diagnosed simply because they’re monitored more closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, researchers didn’t rule out this possibility entirely. “The findings could indicate delayed diagnoses among unmarried individuals,” Karakose noted. On the other hand, they could “challenge the assumption that marriage protects against dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts suggest that social support outside of marriage might matter more. Never-married individuals may build strong friendships and community ties, leading to mental stimulation that &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/reducing-screen-time-protects-childrens-mental-health/"&gt;protects the brain&lt;/a&gt;. Divorced or widowed people often reconnect with others, take on new roles, and may even experience increased happiness or life satisfaction after major changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, some studies have found that divorce, far from being a health risk, can lead to higher emotional well-being. For example, one study found that people who got divorced experienced a slower rate of cognitive decline. Others reported that divorced and widowed individuals were more likely to socialize and engage in health-conscious behaviors than their married peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The relationship between marriage and dementia risk is clearly more complicated than once thought.

Marital status alone may not tell the whole story. Relationship quality, social support, cultural factors, and mental health all play roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One earlier study, using data from the &lt;a href="https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Health and Retirement Study&lt;/a&gt; between 2000 and 2014, found that unmarried people had higher odds of developing dementia. But that research didn’t adjust for as many factors as the current study did. And it didn’t explore dementia subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Florida State University study used data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), which tracks individuals recruited from dementia clinics across the U.S. Participants were all free of dementia at the start. Most were white, and about 60% were female. The average age was just under 72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were classified as married, divorced (which included separated individuals), widowed, or never married. Those living with partners were included in the married group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Marriage might still offer health benefits in some areas. But when it comes to dementia, the picture is far less clear.

Interestingly, people who became widowed during the study were &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; likely to develop dementia than those who stayed married the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="23" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the researchers point out that some limitations exist. The NACC population may not represent the broader U.S. public. It included mostly white, married individuals, and didn’t factor in life stresses like financial hardship or social isolation, which could influence brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="24" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karakose and her team emphasized the need for more detailed studies. “Examining the association through duration of post-marital life, including transitions to divorce, with the role of relationship factors such as marital quality and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/the-surprising-relationship-between-self-esteem-and-sexual-fulfillment/"&gt;relationship duration&lt;/a&gt; may provide a more nuanced understanding,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="where_does_this_leave_us_"&gt;Where does this leave us?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="25" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marriage might still offer health benefits in some areas. But when it comes to dementia, the picture is far less clear. The key takeaway from this study is that marriage alone doesn’t guarantee better cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="26" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relationship status seems to matter less than how supported and connected people feel. Whether single or married, emotional well-being, meaningful social ties, and a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/six-healthy-lifestyle-habits-linked-to-slower-memory-decline-and-lower-dementia-risk/"&gt;healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; might offer the best protection for the aging brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="27" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings won’t change overnight what people think about marriage and aging.

By limiting expression of Scn4b, HDAC5 reduces the excitability of neurons in the brain’s reward system, weakening the formation of powerful drug-environment associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that SCN4B influences cocaine relapse-like behavior without affecting natural reward-seeking, highlighting it as a potential drug-specific therapeutic target. These findings offer a deeper understanding of addiction’s biological roots and open new avenues for relapse prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDAC5 Role:&lt;/strong&gt; HDAC5 suppresses the gene Scn4b, limiting neuron activity that underlies relapse-triggering drug memories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug-Specific Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; SCN4B influences cocaine seeking without affecting natural rewards like sucrose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Treatment Target:&lt;/strong&gt; These mechanisms identify SCN4B as a potential target for relapse-specific addiction therapies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Elsevier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research on the biological basis of addiction has found that the critical epigenetic enzyme histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) limits the expression of the gene &lt;em&gt;Scn4b&lt;/em&gt;, regulating neuronal activity and thereby the formation of strong drug-related memories, which can trigger relapse in individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, detailing these epigenetic mechanisms in the brain, uncovers a new molecular target for the development of novel SUD treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108661"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/enzyme-cocaine-relapse-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This suggests that SCN4B governs a form of drug-specific plasticity that creates prepotent drug-environment associations that can promote relapse. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUDs affect many individuals in the United States directly or indirectly. Drug-related deaths remain at an all-time high in the US and stimulant use specifically is on the rise worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite ongoing efforts, rates of SUDs have remained relatively stable over the past three decades, indicating a need for continued focus on treatment and prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the neurological basis of addiction, often considered a complex biobehavioral illness, holds potential for broader insights into human decision-making, motivation, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUDs are characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite adverse consequences, and relapse affects a large proportion of individuals with SUD attempting to discontinue drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major contributor to relapse risk is the presence of enduring associations between the primary rewarding effects of the drug and cues in the drug-use environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Krystal, MD, Editor of &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, comments, “People say that once you have experienced compulsive substance use, your relationship to that substance can never return to the pre-addiction state. How could these long-lasting associations be sustained?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One possibility is that there are long-lasting changes in the pattern of gene expression that encode these drug memories and that prevent these memories from weakening. This study points to epigenetic mechanisms, one of the processes regulating gene expression patterns on a long-term basis, as a key regulator of relapse-related cocaine consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-lead investigator Christopher W. Cowan, PhD, Department of Neuroscience, Medical University of South Carolina, explains, “In this study, we discovered that a critical epigenetic enzyme HDAC5 functions to limit the expression of Scn4b, which limits the firing of key neurons in the nucleus accumbens, an important brain region linked to SUD and reward-related behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together with our prior work, our findings show that HDAC5 and SCN4B, via regulation of neuronal excitability, selectively limit the formation of powerful and long-lasting links between the drug use environment and the drug use experience that can later serve as triggers of relapse in individuals with a SUD that are attempting to abstain from a return to active drug use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a highly collaborative multilevel study, investigators deployed a wide array of research techniques, including tandem mass spectrometry, enzymatic activity assays, computational modeling, quantitative mRNA analysis, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and rat cocaine and sucrose self-administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant results is the new finding that a sodium channel auxiliary protein, SCN4B, functions to limit relapse-like cocaine seeking but without affecting seeking of a natural reward, sucrose. This suggests that SCN4B governs a form of drug-specific plasticity that creates prepotent drug-environment associations that can promote relapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-lead investigator Daniel J. Wood, MD, PhD candidate, Department of Neuroscience, and Medical Science Training Program, Medical University of South Carolina, notes, “Finding new ways to help people recovering from SUD remain abstinent is as important as ever. The fact that SCN4B is selectively involved in the relapse-like cocaine seeking, but had no effect on sucrose seeking was very surprising to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“SCN4B might be a key puzzle piece toward uncovering drug-induced maladaptive plasticity that drives prepotent drug-environment associations and relapse vulnerability, and it represents a novel therapeutic target for developing treatments that reduce relapse risk in SUD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Krystal concludes, “The deeper neuroscience probes into addiction, the more we uncover fundamental molecular processes that drive or constrain drug seeking. This novel mechanism may point to new treatments for cocaine use disorder, for which there are no current pharmacotherapies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this addiction and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#01696c726c6465686041646d7264776864732f626e6c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eileen Leahy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://elsevier.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elsevier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eileen Leahy – Elsevier&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2025.01.027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Epigenetic control of an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels regulates the strength of drug-cue associations and relapse-like cocaine seeking&lt;/a&gt;” by Christopher W.

Epigenetic factors, like histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5), play a key role in regulating the formation of drug-cue associations, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a combination of molecular biology, cultured cells, tandem mass spectrometry, deacetylase activity measurements, co-immunoprecipitation, and molecular dynamics simulations to assess HDAC5 structure-activity relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In male and female Long-Evans rats, we used viral-mediated expression of HDAC5 mutants in nucleus accumbens (NAc) to test effects on cocaine intravenous self-administration (SA) and cue-reinstated cocaine seeking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also used in silico analysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing data, quantitative RT-PCR, viral-mediated expression of Scn4b shRNA, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and rat cocaine or sucrose SA to assess Scn4b’s effects on NAc intrinsic excitability and cued reward seeking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered that two conserved cysteines located near HDAC5’s catalytic domain were required for its intrinsic deacetylase activity, and that HDAC5’s deacetylase activity was required in NAc medium spiny neurons to limit relapse-like cue-reinstated cocaine seeking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we found that HDAC5 limited cocaine, but not sucrose, seeking behavior by reducing NAc MSN intrinsic excitability through the deacetylase-dependent repression of &lt;em&gt;Scn4b&lt;/em&gt;, which codes for an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that HDAC5’s control of NAc &lt;em&gt;Scn4b&lt;/em&gt; expression governs the formation of cocaine-cue, but not sucrose-cue, associations through modulation of NAc MSN intrinsic excitability and drug-induced NAc plasticity mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 15:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE92V3JTelBDeFJpR2ZJSjBteWhnOW5ra0VxV2J6bVhDVks0WTAwbWljaHJqNmJOUUdQOW1EZjdEYmNabnZWdHducHkzeE5WQXY1Um1kT3U0ZUliV2RTYV85OGhOZ2hIQlE1ajAwWGhR</guid></item><item><title>AI与人类治疗师：机器可以匹配认知疗法吗？ - 分析见解 | AI vs. Human Therapists: Can Machines Match Cognitive Therapy? - Analytics Insight</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxOZ1RmV3JCOHQ5TDRCcjE2bV9fWXlQTnB1bWczcHR6QnJDLUJhRzIzYjZidGZwMmRBWU1vQ2xEQWlrck9zNUtnVHFSVlJVRjYxTXZia0RieG1hWFVCeU5VUVU3WHZnbUh6YVJraXVCaWlfYVMzR00yR3I1MGxoV0owaGhFT2NlUGZmZ3l6NURVQ0Z3VUlFVUJjYUlCcnhtSjFRWlREdjl0Z0pheUIwdm5YeElSeVFaVm_SAcQBQVVfeXFMT2dNTVhRVHBzU0RJS3l1YTJ4a0s4bVJheE1nekt2bzJDNXg2Vm9leXE3Z0lXbmpsWUM0UTJPb242cE9FdjUtcWhkM0ZNdTJwRFNaU3BmS0k3NUJSamRRejJkbXB5dWcyWUNEVi1rVUNIRjUzVTFVZC1WZnNCS19VNl9XRGpJY3ctOEFqZWtGUUVJRzcyRlhEckRZaUZOT21WMWJIbUVHZzVaZmd0VmN2YmJBOVJMU2VJNlhhZEdVTEl1RUd1Vw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-test-id="text" class="arrow-component arr--text-element text-m_textElement__e3QEt text-m_dark__1TC18 "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the hope of convenience is not the same as the promise of effectiveness. Dr. Neha Bhattacharya, a clinical psychologist practicing in South Delhi, envisions a place for technology but with a very definite limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A chatbot can pose CBT-type questions,” she said, “but it cannot read what is not being said. It is not aware of a history of trauma or the fact that silence is meaningful. Therapy is not techniques—it’s timing and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is the point at which most experts feel today's &lt;ins&gt;&lt;a aria-label="content" target="_blank" href="https://www.analyticsinsight.net/artificial-intelligence/ai-writing-tools-in-education-ethical-or-not"&gt;AI tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/ins&gt; lag. While a trained therapist can read a change in voice, a prolonged silence, or an abrupt shift in attitude, a chatbot cannot. Those are the subliminal signs therapists use to read emotional cues, adjust their strategy, and determine when to probe deeper—or back off.

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's no secret that maintaining a high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet is not the healthiest choice for your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But up until now, fat gain, cholesterol issues, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-141d1ae0-1711-11f0-a7fe-b90172f5b10b" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and other weight-based issues were considered the main consequences of a low-quality diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However,&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-unexpected-link-between-diet-and-lung-cancer-risk"&gt; recent research&lt;/a&gt; revealed that glycogen - the molecule that stores glucose - can be a catalyst for lung &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-141c5790-1711-11f0-a7fe-b90172f5b10b"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means that your high fat, high carb diet could potentially lead to this deadly disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lung adenocarcinom is a type of non-small cell lung cancer, and also makes up 40 percent of all lung cancers that people have. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, which looked at the human tissue samples, found that those with lung adenocarcinom had much higher levels of glycogen in them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And when they tested on mice, researchers found that more glycogen actually made it easier for the lung cancer to spread and grow at a faster rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And when they experimented with eliminated glycogen, they found that the tumor growth became limited. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Research shows that a combination of a high-carbohydrate and high-fat diet can lead to lung cancer (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, translated to the foods we eat, glycogen comes from carbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When we work out, our bodies use up this glycogen and use it as a source of energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when we're not using it, it's stored away for later use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who have high-carb, high-fat diets end up making glycogen in surplus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The combination of the two is also important in this study, as researchers had a group of mice that had a high-carb diet, a high-fat diet, a combination of the both, and a control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The group of mice that was on both a high-carb and high-fat diet all had higher levels of lung cancer growth than any of the other groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This isn't the first time diets were looked at as potential factors of types of cancers - especially low-quality diets like high-carb and high-fat eating regimes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though in the past, the belief that diets can contribute to cancer were limited to pancreatic or liver cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Human tissue with lung cancer was found to show higher levels of glycogen in it (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Glycogen has been recognized as a feature of cancer cells, and as scientists are looking at its relation to cancer, more research is still required. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is also true for lung cancer, especially because higher levels of glycogen were not found in other types of lung cancer aside from lung adenocarcinom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But one thing for certain is that a link does exist - and that it's important to make healthy diet choices to avoid dangerous conditions including lung cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And things that contribute to a high-carb and high-fat diet like red meat and alcohol should be consumed in moderation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Your lungs and the rest of your body will thank you for it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; More than half of American adults have &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906963/sneaky-reasons-blood-pressure-is-high-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; (aka hypertension), a silent condition that raises the risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yet, as prevalent as high blood pressure is, there are steps you can take to prevent it. One of the most powerful is diet. While there are lots of foods to protect against high blood pressure, there are others that can cause it. And research has found that one of the biggest offenders is processed deli meat. It’s so potentially troublesome that one study found that consuming as little as 17 grams of processed meat per day (slightly more than a half-ounce) may increase a person’s odds of hypertension.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re eating a deli sandwich while you’re reading this, don’t panic. One meal won’t cause hypertension. But there are important reasons to limit this blood pressure-raising food. Read on to learn why deli meat spells bad news for blood pressure, plus dietitian-approved alternatives to keep your numbers in check. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-processed-deli-meat-may-increase-the-risk-of-high-blood-pressure"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Processed Deli Meat May Increase the Risk of High Blood Pressure  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Sodium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Food manufacturers add &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-you-eat-salt-if-you-have-high-blood-pressure-8412363" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt; to deli meat to improve taste and help maintain texture and shelf life. “Deli meat is one of those foods where the sodium content can be surprisingly high,” says &lt;a href="https://hnd.buffalostate.edu/directory/drew-hemler-msc-rd-cdn-fand" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Drew Hemler, M.Sc., RD, FAND&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and lecturer and advisor in multidisciplinary studies at Buffalo State University. “A standard 3-ounce portion—just a few slices—can deliver a serious sodium hit.” Take deli ham, for instance. One 3-ounce serving packs roughly 750 milligrams of sodium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s roughly two-thirds of the maximum 2,300 mg of sodium most of us should eat in an entire day (and half the 1,500-mg limit the American Heart Association recommends for people with high blood pressure).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why is sodium such a problem? “High sodium content may cause your body to retain water, increasing blood volume and putting extra pressure on your blood vessel walls, which directly impacts blood pressure,” says registered dietitian&lt;a href="https://www.patriciabannan.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Patricia Bannan, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;From Burnout to Balance&lt;/em&gt;. Considering the typical American consumes an average of 3,400 mg of sodium daily, every bite counts. Since even reduced-sodium deli meats can contain surprisingly high sodium, label reading is a must. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Contains Blood Pressure-Raising Preservatives &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sodium isn’t the only additive in processed deli meat that’s bad for blood pressure. Many deli meats also contain added nitrates and nitrites. These ingredients are added during processing to improve color and flavor and protect against bacterial contamination. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It doesn’t help that these substances are confusing! While &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7959424/what-are-nitrates-are-they-bad-for-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nitrates and nitrites naturally found in fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; have been found to be beneficial for blood pressure and heart health, nitrates that are added to processed foods, like deli meat, have the opposite effect. According to emerging research, added nitrites may raise blood pressure by narrowing the arteries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition, these compounds have also been linked to insulin resistance, coronary heart disease and cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  So, it’s a good idea to limit them as much as possible. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Lacks Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you think of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, digestive health might be the first thing to come to mind. However, fiber also plays an important role in heart health, including blood pressure. In fact, research published in the American Heart Association’s journal &lt;em&gt;Hypertension&lt;/em&gt; recommends dietary fiber as a treatment for blood pressure control. That’s because fiber is believed to feed your good gut bacteria, helping them produce blood pressure-lowering compounds called short-chain fatty acids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Trouble is, deli meats are completely devoid of fiber. Better bets are naturally fiber-rich whole foods, like fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils, chickpeas and whole grains. These foods are staples of the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289964/7-day-dash-diet-menu/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, an eating plan with a long, proven track record for lowering blood pressure. But if a turkey sandwich is your only option, order it on whole-wheat bread and pile on the lettuce, tomato, avocado and onion for fiber.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-foods-to-focus-on-for-healthy-blood-pressure"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Foods to Focus On for Healthy Blood Pressure &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While deli meat may be trouble for blood pressure, there are lots of foods you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; eat to improve your numbers, like these.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fruit. &lt;/strong&gt;Fruit is rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, a key nutrient for healthy blood pressure. This mineral works by balancing the blood pressure-raising effects of sodium in our diets. &lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Both fresh and dried fruits are great ways to get more potassium, especially apricots, prunes, bananas and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7866075/number-1-food-to-lower-blood-pressure-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;watermelon&lt;/a&gt; (our favorite food for lower blood pressure!). Plus, they’re also rich in fiber. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vegetables. &lt;/strong&gt;Like fruits, vegetables are loaded with potassium. And they’re among the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057241/top-high-fiber-foods-you-need-in-your-life/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;best sources of fiber&lt;/a&gt;. Top choices include potatoes, beets, leafy greens, avocados, beans and legumes. Thanks to quick, convenient options like bagged salad and spinach, canned beans and lentils and frozen veggies, getting your fill is easier than you might think. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-Fat Dairy and Dairy Alternatives. &lt;/strong&gt;Low-fat dairy is another DASH diet staple that’s rich in blood pressure-regulating potassium and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944074/foods-with-more-calcium-than-milk/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt;. “Calcium supports contraction and relaxation of blood vessels,” says Hemler. “You don’t need to stick to dairy. Yes, milk and yogurt are great, but leafy greens like kale and bok choy, tofu, almonds and calcium-fortified plant milks also count.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole Grains. &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to dietary fiber, whole grains provide &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2052607/10-signs-youre-not-getting-enough-magnesium-and-what-to-do-about-it/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, which also supports healthy blood pressure. “Magnesium keeps blood vessels relaxed and helps regulate other key minerals like calcium and potassium,” says Hemler. To make sure you’re getting the most bang, opt for 100% whole grains when choosing bread, pasta and cereal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatty Fish. &lt;/strong&gt;Fatty fish are rich in DHA and EPA,&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt; long-chain omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt; that have been shown to reduce blood pressure. While all fish are good for you, salmon, mackerel, anchovies, herring and sardines are the best sources of these heart-healthy fats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water. &lt;/strong&gt;“Consistent fluid intake like water keeps your blood volume stable and helps your kidneys flush out excess sodium,” says Hemler. “When you’re even mildly dehydrated, your blood vessels can constrict, and your blood pressure may increase.” In addition to water, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17576/8-hydrating-foods-to-help-you-meet-your-water-goals/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="7"&gt;hydrating foods&lt;/a&gt; like cucumbers, melons, oranges and lettuce can also help you get the fluids you need, he says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Deli meats deliver a double-edged sword when it comes to high blood pressure. On one end, they’re filled with blood pressure-raising sodium and nitrates. On the other, they’re low in fiber, which helps protect against hypertension. That’s why deli meats are the No. 1 food to limit to reduce your risk of high blood pressure. We’re not saying you can never eat a ham or turkey sandwich again, but the fewer deli meats on your plate, the better. So, next time you need a quick lunch from the deli, order a tuna sandwich on whole-wheat bread instead. Your heart will thank you.&lt;br&gt;

Using brain imaging in both mice and humans, the study found that brain regions involved in social behavior were hyperconnected in childhood but under-connected after puberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shifts appear linked to changes in synaptic structure, particularly a sharp loss of dendritic spines after puberty. Inhibiting a key protein, GSK3-beta, partially restored connectivity in mice, highlighting a potential therapeutic target for neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connectivity Flip:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain regions in 22q deletion were overconnected before puberty, under-connected after.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synaptic Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Post-pubertal drop in dendritic spines correlated with disrupted social behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targetable Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; Inhibiting GSK3-beta restored connectivity and spine density in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCLA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes in brain connectivity before and after puberty may explain why some children with a rare genetic disorder have higher risk of developing autism or schizophrenia, according to a UCLA Health study.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developmental psychiatric disorders like autism and schizophrenia are associated with changes in brain functional connectivity. However, the complexity of these conditions make it difficult to understand the underlying biological causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By studying genetically defined brain disorders, researchers at UCLA Health and collaborators have shed light on possible mechanisms. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108665"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two kids and brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/puberty-ASD-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The protein GSK3-beta, which is involved in synapse regulation, may play a role in the connectivity changes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UCLA study examined a particular genetic condition called chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome — caused by missing DNA on chromosome 22 — which is associated with higher risk of developing neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the underlying biological basis of this association has not been well understood&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, researchers used functional brain imaging in both mice and humans to investigate potential mechanisms driving the connection between the genetic mutation and development of neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional brain imaging showed the brain regions in both humans and genetically modified mice were hyperconnected before puberty before switching to being under-connected after puberty, particularly in brain regions tied to social skills and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-senior author Carrie Bearden, Professor at the UCLA Health Semel Institute and the UCLA Brain Research Institute, said changes at the synapse level appear to explain the sudden shift in connectivity and associated effects on social behavior&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Differences in functional connectivity observed on MRI are commonly found in psychiatric disorders, but we don’t have a good understanding of why. It was really valuable to study this phenomenon across species,” Bearden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mice that were genetically modified to mimic chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, Bearden and her colleagues at the Italian Institute of Technology found younger mice had a larger density of dendritic spines — small protrusions on brain cells used to communicate with other neurons via synapses — during childhood compared to wild-type (normal) mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the mice reached the equivalent of puberty, the number of dendritic spines sharply decreased compared to wild-type mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein GSK3-beta, which is involved in synapse regulation, may play a role in the connectivity changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bearden and her collaborators used a drug to inhibit GSK3-beta, which worked to temporarily restore brain activity and dendritic spine density in the mice, possibly by regulating the removal of dendritic spines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging of humans with the condition also found the brain regions affected by the connectivity changes had enriched genes related to GSK3-beta. Further, the brain connectivity changes were related to social behavior in humans, suggesting that the altered wiring contributes to autism traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings, Bearden said, suggests that synaptic dysfunction drives the changes in brain activity and could be a target to prevent or reduce symptoms caused by chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings strongly suggest that over-weeding of synapses during development may contribute to the behavioral challenges we see,” Bearden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was co-led by Alessandro Gozzi of the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia in Rovereto, Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this autism research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#83f4ebecf6f0f7ecedc3eee6e7ede6f7adf6e0efe2ade6e7f6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Will Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucla.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Will Houston – UCLA&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adq2807" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Synaptic-dependent developmental dysconnectivity in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome&lt;/a&gt;” by Carrie Bearden et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synaptic-dependent developmental dysconnectivity in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion increases the risk of neuropsychiatric disorders like autism and schizophrenia. Disruption of large-scale functional connectivity in 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) has been widely reported, but the biological factors driving these changes remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a cross-species design to uncover the developmental trajectory and neural underpinnings of brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS. In LgDel mice, a model for 22q11DS, we found age-specific patterns of brain dysconnectivity, with widespread fMRI hyperconnectivity in juvenile mice reconfiguring to hippocampal hypoconnectivity over puberty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes correlated with developmental alterations in dendritic spine density, and both were transiently normalized by GSK3β inhibition, suggesting a synaptic origin for this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, analogous pubertal hyperconnectivity-to-hypoconnectivity reconfiguration occurs in human 22q11DS, affecting cortical regions enriched for GSK3β-associated synaptic genes and autism-relevant transcripts. This dysconnectivity also predicts age-dependent social alterations in 22q11DS individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that synaptic mechanisms underlie developmental brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 14:59:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTFBZbUtTM0Y1SlJqNU5KWXljemdKdU9LeDZITzl6QmJnT0RzdXQ1dTZtQkRvaGVPaGpLR0dIYlRPZ2VFM3poakpfNE9oWU9EOHZLX1hVODJyLWw4MUFraWExdVNjSQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
