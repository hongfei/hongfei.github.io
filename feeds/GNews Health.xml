But it’s not just gluttony for gluttony’s sake. There’s a physiological reason December leaves so many of us feeling, well, inflated. “Bloating occurs when the digestive system struggles to efficiently break down and move &lt;a href="/topic/food"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;,” says Wilkinson. “During the Christmas period, this is particularly common as people consume larger portions, eat a wider variety of foods and often stray from their usual routine.” In other words, it’s not you; it’s your gut, desperately trying to keep up with the sudden influx of roast potatoes, cheese boards, cocktails, canapes and late-night leftovers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? “There are simple, natural ways to support digestion and reduce feelings of heaviness and discomfort in the gut,” Wilkinson explains. Certain foods contain the enzymes, fibres and beneficial &lt;a href="/topic/bacteria"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; that “help the gut work at its best, even when festive indulgences are at their peak”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilkinson has five recommendations for foods that don’t demand restriction or reinvention of saintly behaviour, yet can still stop your Christmas from feeling like one very long, slow-moving meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fermented foods: the microbiome’s festive rescue squad&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/48/iStock-2212401124.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/48/iStock-2212401124.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/48/iStock-2212401124.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A forkful of fermented food is the simplest way to stop the Christmas buffet fighting back" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-188117"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;A forkful of fermented food is the simplest way to stop the Christmas buffet fighting back&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fermented foods are one of the most effective ways to naturally support digestion,” Wilkinson says. “Foods like probiotic-rich yoghurts, sauerkraut, kimchi and kombucha contain ‘healthy bacteria’ designed to help maintain a balanced gut &lt;a href="/topic/microbiome"&gt;microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That microbiome takes a beating in December: more alcohol, more sugar, less &lt;a href="/topic/fibre"&gt;fibre&lt;/a&gt; and less routine. It’s chaos for the trillions of microbes that normally keep our digestion humming along. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When these foods are eaten regularly,” Wilkinson adds, “they introduce this healthy bacteria to the gut, supporting the breakdown of food while reducing gas production and digestive discomfort.” Essentially, they can soften the blow of the Christmas buffet before it lands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented foods also keep things moving, essential when your mealtimes resemble a tasting menu without an endpoint. “Probiotics also help regulate bowel movements, which is particularly important during a month when eating patterns can become irregular.” A spoonful of sauerkraut or a morning kefir is hardly the height of festive glamour, but neither is feeling like your stomach has turned into a snow globe someone won’t stop shaking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And crucially, they don’t need to be eaten in huge quantities to make a difference. If fermented food simply isn’t your vibe, Wilkinson suggests “making use of gut-friendly supplements” with ingredients like milk thistle, silymarin and dandelion, such as Dr Vegan’s Debloat and Detox range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ginger: the digestive accelerator your stomach will thank you for&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/11/iStock-1406731310.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/11/iStock-1406731310.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/11/iStock-1406731310.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Ginger: the tiny root doing the heavy lifting after your third cheese course" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-188118"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Ginger: the tiny root doing the heavy lifting after your third cheese course&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If fermented foods are the slow-and-steady helpers, &lt;a href="/topic/ginger"&gt;ginger&lt;/a&gt; is the fast-acting first responder. “Ginger has long been used around the world to support digestion and ease digestive discomfort,” Wilkinson says. It works on a mechanical level, not just a folkloric one. “It contains natural compounds that help stimulate the digestive tract and encourage efficient ‘gastric emptying’.” That means food doesn’t linger in the stomach for hours, which is precisely when bloating and fullness set in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When food leaves the stomach more steadily, feelings of bloating and fullness are significantly reduced,” she adds. It’s particularly helpful at Christmas because zingibain – the enzyme in ginger – “helps to break down proteins”. Which, when you consider the sheer volume of meat, cheese, nuts and canapes consumed in December, feels less like a nice-to-have and more like festive survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps that ginger is easy to weave into your routine without feeling like a health kick. “Fresh ginger tea made with hot water, lemon and grated ginger is a soothing option after meals, and ginger can also be added to smoothies, soups or stir-fries for an effortless digestive boost throughout the week.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oats: the quiet hero of a comfortable December&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/35/iStock-2214074450.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/35/iStock-2214074450.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/35/iStock-2214074450.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A bowl of oats – the calm, steadying counterbalance to December’s chaos" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-188119"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;A bowl of oats – the calm, steadying counterbalance to December’s chaos&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re oscillating wildly between sugar highs and gravy-induced slumps, oats might be the grounding force your gut needs. “Oats are one of the most beneficial, affordable foods for maintaining steady, comfortable digestion,” says Wilkinson. While December eating is heavy on refined carbohydrates and low on fibre, oats do the opposite. They provide slow-release energy and the kind of soluble fibre your digestive system is crying out for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They contain beta-glucans, a type of soluble fibre that supports digestive regularity, maintains healthy gut bacteria and helps reduce inflammation in the digestive tract.” That means fewer spikes and crashes, a more cooperative gut and, crucially, less of the bloating that creeps in when your body is overwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Beginning the day with porridge or overnight oats can make a meaningful difference to digestive comfort throughout the festive period,” she says. The stabilised blood sugar also “reduces energy crashes and cravings that can lead to further overeating”. Translation: a bowl of porridge might save you from inhaling half a yule log at 11am because you “haven’t eaten anything yet”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Papaya: the enzyme-packed surprise entry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 hYlFdB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/01/iStock-914617584.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/01/iStock-914617584.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/01/iStock-914617584.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Papaya brings enzyme power to a month built almost entirely on protein and dairy" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-188120"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Papaya brings enzyme power to a month built almost entirely on protein and dairy&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papaya might not be the first thing you reach for in December, but Wilkinson argues it should be. “Papaya is rich in an enzyme called papain, which helps break down proteins and supports smoother, more comfortable digestion.” This is particularly relevant when your regular meals have been replaced with turkey sandwiches, cheese selections and yet another portion of pigs in blankets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Beyond its enzyme benefits, papaya offers hydration, fibre and antioxidants,” she says. “These elements work together to reduce irritation in the digestive tract and contribute to regular bowel movements.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh papaya is best, “though dried papaya can also offer benefits as long as it is consumed in moderation and with minimal added sugars”. It’s worth noting her caveat that “papaya is not recommended for pregnant women”, a crucial detail often missed in wellness content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Apples: the humble digestive workhorse&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bHmhpR"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/25/iStock-2184346751.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/25/iStock-2184346751.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/25/iStock-2184346751.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The humble apple quietly outperforms most festive ‘gut fixes’ – and costs far less" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-188121"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;The humble apple quietly outperforms most festive ‘gut fixes’ – and costs far less&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While papaya brings the drama, &lt;a href="/topic/apples"&gt;apples&lt;/a&gt; bring the reliability. “Apples are one of the simplest yet most effective foods for easing bloating and supporting a healthy gut,” Wilkinson says. They’re rich in pectin, “a form of soluble fibre that absorbs water and helps move food steadily through the digestive tract.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steady movement is key. It prevents the “bunged up” feeling that often defines the later stages of December, when meals begin to stack on top of each other. Apples also contain natural prebiotics, “especially in the core”, which help strengthen the microbiome and improve digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, Wilkinson specifies that “eating apples raw will benefit your digestive system most, though they can also be blended into smoothies and even baked into desserts”. They are, quite simply, the easiest festive gut support going. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A gentler, less bloated Christmas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, no single food is a cure-all. And Wilkinson is clear about the bigger picture: “In addition to the foods listed above, it’s also super important to stay hydrated, get enough sleep, though this isn’t always possible during the festive season.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, with a few fermented foods, a grating of ginger, a bowl of oats, a slice of papaya or an apple tucked into your bag, you can embrace the excess without feeling like your stomach is staging a mutiny. Christmas, after all, is meant to be enjoyed, not endured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 12:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxPa3p3SjhoWHhrejFoUE9VOFNfUXh4UmdSR19zdzVrYTNhamlMRUNLMHJBZWVJcmJTU3lMTlIxT1JOYW1WOGg1R0JRMGk5SWNYekZvS3BSb2l1RE5FS3hIcWh1MXNxNE8zOExSLVRHQjhWLU1Gd2xCQ2dxVEFhOW02RjdzU1hvNDhUWlVOd210UUR4Vm9OQ004N0tIdVhBVFRURTg2U0Jta052Sm11OGN1VTVVSWhaYTd0bEItOF9TQWVSdTdrbG5r</guid></item><item><title>专栏|每天感受奇迹可以改善我们的健康。操作方法如下。-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/12/19/finding-awe-wonder-health-art/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KQT37SZWTBADRC2GEXRLHMMLUA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I just had a most eventful week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BSFGQSEQUFGYXDOZ4VKXENVA6I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I watched in horror as a terrible storm in the Mediterranean dashed a ship against a rocky coast, forcing its crew and passengers into a desperate attempt to save themselves and rescue their cargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 11:31:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPMHdGOWxva29RbS0zRGhLZ1ZDMWs3QzktOXRhYkJqZkJUd2pKSER4cnd0U0dBbU9GT29IT216TDNDV29rWTU5RmIxWnJFOTFEbVNUNEwtdXREM1BxSmotcEFIMUlDSWl4N043dUliZ2RwbkZRcUtMMFBwOElRQ3haUHJaWlgtOTZpclFuZU9tY0tkMlZvVWY0</guid></item><item><title>FDA疫苗内部骚动- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-vaccine-memo-uproar/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Six days after a senior FDA official sent a &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26381196-prasad-email/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;sweeping internal email&lt;/a&gt; claiming that COVID vaccines had caused the deaths of "at least 10 children," &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/12-ex-fda-leaders-criticize-claims-made-by-agency-current-vaccine-chief-vinay-prasad/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;12 former FDA commissioners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; released an &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2517497" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;extraordinary warning&lt;/a&gt; in the Dec. 3 New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wrote that the claims and policy changes in &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/food-drug-administration-covid-19-vaccines-pediatric-deaths/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;the memo from Dr. Vinay Prasad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, pose "a threat to evidence-based vaccine policy and public health security" and break sharply from long-standing scientific norms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is unfolding inside the Food and Drug Administration is not a narrow dispute over COVID vaccines. It is an attempt, according to critics and vaccine scientists, to rewrite the rules governing the entire U.S. vaccine system — how risks are weighed, how benefits are proved, and how quickly lifesaving shots reach the public. Former agency leaders warn that if these changes take hold, the consequences could be lasting: fewer vaccines, slower updates, weakened public trust, and more preventable outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad made clear he sees the moment as corrective. "Never again will the US FDA commissioner have to himself find deaths in children for staff to identify it," he wrote, telling employees the agency's mission, and its "worldview," would change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad's email reopened old arguments about COVID vaccines, using what is generally considered weak and misleading science in the peer-reviewed research community. He claimed that &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-tracy-beth-hoeg-controversy/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;FDA staff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had found "at least 10" deaths in children that happened "after and because of" COVID vaccination, using reports from the &lt;a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    &lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VAERS system is notoriously crowdsourced, meaning anyone can contribute, and scientists say it serves only as a clearinghouse for reports. For example, a person could file a report saying that after getting a flu shot, their hair turned purple. Though that report would remain in the database until it was reviewed, it cannot prove the cause of medical events. But Prasad argued that the true number of deaths was likely higher because many cases go unreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Substack, &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/scoop-fda-vaccine-chiefs-memo-cited" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside Medicine&lt;/em&gt; reported Dec. 11&lt;/a&gt; that Prasad used incomplete information and that a Dec. 5 internal FDA memo set the pediatric death toll from COVID shots somewhere between zero and seven. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard wrote, "The FDA's investigation into deaths caused by Covid vaccines is still ongoing and there's no final count yet of those deaths."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad also accused the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of downplaying the risk of heart inflammation, called myocarditis, in young men; criticized the agency for approving shots for teenagers; and suggested that school and workplace vaccine mandates may have "harmed more children than we saved," adding that "we do not know if we saved lives on balance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;more than 2,100 American children&lt;/a&gt; died of COVID itself since the pandemic began, the CDC reported.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on his erroneous and misleading claims about COVID vaccines, Prasad proposed a major overhaul of how vaccines are approved. He said the FDA should stop relying on immune markers to establish the efficacy of shots, such as antibody levels, and instead require large placebo-controlled randomized trials that track hospitalizations and deaths before approving most new vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many immunologists and vaccine experts say it's unethical to test vaccines known to be effective against disease with a control group that would receive a placebo, exposing them to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a rock-solid principle in bioethics that it is unethical to test any drug or vaccine against a placebo if it is known to be safe and effective. The reason is that such placebo-controlled trials would effectively deny patients access to a vaccine that could prevent a dangerous infectious disease," said Dr. Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad called the current flu vaccine system an "evidence-based catastrophe," questioned the approval of vaccines for pregnant women based on immune response alone, and raised concerns about giving multiple vaccines at once. He told staff to rewrite FDA guidelines to match his new "worldview" and said anyone who disagreed with his "core principles" should resign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former FDA leaders expressed alarm in the NEJM article. They said Prasad is exploiting public frustration over the federal response to COVID to spark doubt about the entire childhood vaccine system, which could undo decades of success in protecting children from deadly diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is really different. And it's really dangerous. And people will be hurt, particularly by the vaccine decisions," former FDA commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in an interview. He also warned that Prasad's proposed policies — which he noted echo positions on vaccines held by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist — could shake the entire vaccine market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The goal of RFK seems to be to make it impossible for vaccines to be available in the U.S.," he said. If the proposals advance, he added,"it won't be a viable business."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hilliard pushed back sharply on those concerns, writing: "The American people deserve evidence-based science. Dr. Prasad's email lays out a philosophical framework that points us toward that higher standard. We will soon release documents laying out that framework and data confirming how the COVID vaccine resulted in children's deaths that previous leadership failed to properly investigate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For generations, the childhood vaccine program has depended on clear rules, strong safety systems, and public trust. Experts say Prasad's ideas, based on claims they argue are not supported by real evidence, could make it much harder to test, approve, and deliver vaccines to families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fueling parental doubt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad's memo indicates he considers VAERS reports as proof that vaccines caused children's deaths. The system, though, is designed to be only an "&lt;a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/about.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;early warning system&lt;/a&gt;" for potential safety issues with vaccines that can be investigated further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"VAERS signals should never be taken as proof of true vaccine risks without careful, confirmatory studies," said Dr. Katherine Yih, an epidemiologist and longtime investigator with the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a CDC program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing so, scientists say, directly feeds public fear at a time when many parents are already unsure whom to trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Causation requires converging evidence, not just one report or coincidence," said Dr. Robert Hopkins, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad's framework, however, treats uncertainty as a reason to halt development entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts fear this doubt won't stay limited to COVID vaccines. Once parents start to question the FDA's honesty, they may begin doubting long-standing vaccines for measles, polio, or whooping cough — shots that have protected children for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Science must be transparent," Gostin said. If families believe the FDA is misusing data or silencing experts, confidence in the entire vaccine system can collapse, he said. "There's a public narrative that people have lost trust in science, but that's not true. The vast majority want the FDA to make decisions based on the best scientific evidence. Once they believe that the agency is marginalizing scientists and cherry-picking evidence, their trust will plummet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Delicate vaccine pipeline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad's new framework will likely make it far harder for companies to produce or update vaccines. The 12 former FDA commissioners warned that requiring clinical trials for all new or updated shots would slow vaccine improvements and leave people unprotected. His plan, they wrote, "would impede the ability to update vaccines in a timely fashion, especially for respiratory viruses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fast-changing viruses like flu and COVID, this could be disastrous. There's simply not enough time to run full clinical trials every time a virus mutates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also major business effects. Vaccine development is costly, and companies may decide the U.S. is no longer worth the risk. If companies slow down or leave the market, families could face shortages, fewer innovations, and fewer protections for their kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rising fear, falling standards, and under strain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science depends on open and public debate. Prasad's memo warned his employees against it. In addition to demanding that FDA staff members who disagree with him resign, he said their disputes should stay private and called leaks "unethical" and "illegal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susan Ellenberg, a former director of the FDA's Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, warned that Prasad risks destroying the process that makes science credible. "If disagreement is treated as disloyalty, you lose the only mechanism that keeps science honest," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without strong internal debate, safety reviews become weaker. "You lose the checks and balances that make vaccine safety science credible," said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who served on the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Network during the COVID pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Given its large R&amp;amp;D budget, it was natural to use Pfizer as a barometer of the pharmaceutical industry, which was in the midst of a productivity slump. In the 1990s, the Food and Drug Administration approved a total of 311 new medicines. However, despite far greater investments in R&amp;amp;D, the industry received only 235 approvals over &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/histories-fda-regulated-products/summary-nda-approvals-receipts-1938-present" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the next decade.&lt;/a&gt; At the time, industry skeptics felt this was the new norm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, I had a different view. In the 2000s, the industry was undergoing a major transformation. Based on the remarkable advances being made in the understanding of the causes of diseases thanks to the unraveling of the human genome, along with the appreciation of the potential of drugs outside of small molecules like antibodies and therapeutic vaccines, it was apparent that the pharmaceutical industry was on the cusp of a productivity surge. We were on the verge of a new age in drug discovery that would make big advances in treating cancer, diabetes, and other debilitating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I suspect that Berenson felt I was a bit naïve in my views. He (or his editors) titled his article “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/business/a-pfizer-scientist-sees-research-dividends-ahead.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Optimistic&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/business/a-pfizer-scientist-sees-research-dividends-ahead.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; A Pfizer Scientist Sees Research Dividends Ahead&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have discovered a tiny RNA molecule that can potentially lead the way toward treatments against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called PreS, the molecule enables a bacteria-eating virus known as a bacteriophage — or phage, for short — to take control of a bacterial cell and use it for its own growth, eventually destroying the bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Antibiotic resistance is one of the most serious global health threats of our time,” Dr. Sahar Melamed, head of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem’s Melamed lab, told The Times of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how phages operate can “aid scientists in furthering research and therapies that might help fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peer-reviewed study, led by PhD student Aviezer Silverman, MSc student Raneem Nashef, and computational biologist Reut Wasserman from the Hebrew University, in collaboration with Prof. Ido Golding’s group from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, appeared on Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2025.11.019"&gt;Molecular Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-article-startup newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="startupisrael" data-from="Newly discovered RNA molecule could lead to new treatments in war against ‘superbugs’"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;h3&gt;The global threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of antimicrobial resistance has become a global health challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the world, these bacteria that defy antibiotics — commonly known as “superbugs” — were directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As early as 2013, a State Comptroller’s report found that some 5,000 Israelis were dying annually from infections associated with this bacterial resistance, and those numbers continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A French-Canadian microbiologist, Félix d’Hérelle, first discovered bacteriophages in 1917. He chose the name from the Ancient Greek phagein, to devour, or to eat bacteria. He found the bacteriophage that destroyed the bacteria that cause dysentery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once penicillin was discovered, most scientists stopped researching phages. As bacteria have become more resistant to antibiotics, researchers realized they needed more solutions and returned to phage research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Phage therapy research in Israel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for a solution has become increasingly urgent as more bacteria become resistant to antibiotic treatment. Over the course of the two-year war in Gaza, dozens of IDF soldiers became infected with these superbugs. One soldier, &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/staff-sgt-res-hanan-drori-26-dies-of-fungal-infection-after-gaza-injury/"&gt;Hanan Drori&lt;/a&gt;, died from a severe fungal infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the Israel Phage Therapy Center was established in partnership with Hadassah Medical Center, focusing on the therapeutic potential of phages that target and kill bacteria with precision, with numerous successful phage treatments against microbial infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the war began, the center’s researchers have named some of the phages that they discover in &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/researcher-names-potent-lifesaving-virus-after-soldier-boyfriend-killed-in-gaza-war/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; of people who were killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Listening to RNAs ‘talk’ to each other&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melamed said the lab used RIL-seq (RNA Interaction by Ligation and sequencing), a method he developed during his post-doctorate studies in Prof. Hanah Margalit’s lab at Hebrew University.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3715225" class="wp-caption  alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/Sahar-Melamed-Credit-Bruno-Charbit-e1766070544887.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-vertical wp-image-3715225" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/Sahar-Melamed-Credit-Bruno-Charbit-e1766070544887-300x480.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Prof. Sahar Melamed of Hebrew University’s Melamed Lab in the Faculty of Medicine. (Courtesy/Bruno Charbit)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientist said that he invented a new application for RIL-seq in this current study to map interactions “while the bacteria are infected with the phage,” Melamed explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIL-seq is a method that identifies interacting RNA molecules inside a cell by “gluing” them together and then sequencing the joined molecules to see which RNAs are paired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers could study how small RNAs “talked” to each other within the bacteria, uncovering “a new level of communication between bacteria and phages,” he said, mapping RNA interactions that were previously hard to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melamed said they were surprised to discover the tiny RNA molecule PreS inside a lambda phage, which attacks E. coli bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[Lambda] is one of the most studied viruses for the past 75 years,” he said, “but we found PreS, which no one had noticed before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PreS hijacks the bacterium’s replication machinery,” Melamed said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is then able to “reproduce efficiently inside individual bacteria,” he explained. “It also maximizes its spread through the bacterial population.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an increasing number of phages are produced, they get so numerous that they burst out of the cell, killing the bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3715235" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/image005-e1766064633176.png"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3715235" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/image005-e1766064633176-640x400.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

(Courtesy/Aviezer Silverman)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncovering how PreS takes control of bacterial cells provides important basic knowledge that could help scientists design smarter, more effective phage treatments in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melamed said his lab’s next study will focus on finding other RNA molecules in diverse phages, “to understand how they also manipulate bacterial systems and tailor them for their needs.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3715239" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/image006.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3715239" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/image006-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Scientists are actively seeking alternative treatments for antimicrobial resistance,” Melamed said. “One particularly promising approach is phage therapy, which uses viruses that specifically infect and kill bacteria, offering a targeted and potentially powerful alternative to conventional antibiotics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that this research changes “how we think about the molecular dialogue between phages and their hosts, providing potential new routes for phage therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We know that the genes we're born with contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/couples-are-more-likely-to-share-psychiatric-disorders-but-why"&gt;the risk of psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt; during our lifetimes, and a new study shows there is significantly more biological overlap across these conditions than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international team of scientists behind the research believes that their findings can help improve how these conditions are diagnosed and treated: not just through symptoms and behavior, but also through shared &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-the-first-single-gene-to-directly-cause-mental-illness"&gt;genetic factors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now, we diagnose psychiatric disorders based on what we see in the room, and many people will be diagnosed with multiple disorders. That can be hard to treat and disheartening for patients," &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2025/12/10/sweeping-study-shows-similar-genetic-factors-underlie-multiple-psychiatric-disorders"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Andrew Grotzinger, from the University of Colorado Boulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This work provides the best evidence yet that there may be things that we are currently giving different names to that are actually driven by the same biological processes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/owning-a-cat-could-double-your-risk-of-schizophrenia-research-suggests"&gt;Cat Ownership Linked to Increased Risk of Schizophrenia, Research Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed DNA data from more than 1 million people diagnosed with 14 different psychiatric disorders, comparing their genomes with those of another 5 million people without these diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186166" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186166" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/FiveGroups.jpg" alt="Disorder groups" class="wp-image-186166 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/FiveGroups.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/FiveGroups-600x286.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186166" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Disorders were grouped based on shared genetics. (Grotzinger et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That analysis revealed five genomic factors – or recurring patterns across genes – underlying these disorders. Together, these five factors, composed of 238 genetic variants, accounted for an average of around two thirds of the genetic differences between participants &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hidden-signals-can-reveal-mental-illness-more-clearly-than-a-brain-scan"&gt;with psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt; and those without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each factor was most strongly linked with a particular group of conditions: compulsive disorders (like obsessive-compulsive disorder), internalizing disorders (such as anxiety and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="186163" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;), substance use disorders, neurodevelopmental conditions (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/children-with-autism-adhd-and-anorexia-share-a-common-microbe-imbalance"&gt;including autism&lt;/a&gt;), and finally bipolar disorder and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="186163" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bipolar-disorder-linked-to-a-higher-risk-of-early-death-than-smoking"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-new-schizophrenia-risk-genes-in-first-of-its-kind-study"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoaffective_disorder"&gt;which typically aren't diagnosed together&lt;/a&gt; – the researchers found that 70 percent of the genetic signaling common with these two conditions was shared between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Genetically, we saw that they are more similar than they are unique," &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2025/12/10/sweeping-study-shows-similar-genetic-factors-underlie-multiple-psychiatric-disorders"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Grotzinger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By identifying what is shared across these disorders, we can hopefully come up with ways to target them in a different way that doesn't require four separate pills or four separate psychotherapy interventions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has already shown substantial overlap between psychiatric disorders: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.17121383"&gt;More than half&lt;/a&gt; of those diagnosed with one condition are eventually diagnosed with at least one additional disorder. This study helps explain the biological basis for that overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/several-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-root-cause-study-shows"&gt;Several Psychiatric Disorders Share The Same Root Cause, Study Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also identified biological pathways influenced by the shared genetic risk variants, which could eventually guide new treatments or prevention strategies. Some of these pathways are involved in early brain development and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-cells-may-actually-try-to-predict-the-future-during-sleep"&gt;neuron signaling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic factors common to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are associated with excitatory neurons, whereas the variants shared in the depression/anxiety gene cluster appear to involve &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-alzheimers-finding-brains-support-cells-may-be-fueling-disease"&gt;oligodendrocytes, cells that support neurons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been studying &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/several-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-root-cause-study-reveals"&gt;the genetic underpinnings&lt;/a&gt; of psychiatric disorders &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cortex-transcriptome-overlap-different-mental-illnesses"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt; now, with the ultimate aim of improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment effectiveness, particularly for those with multiple conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings won't immediately change clinical diagnostic practices, the researchers hope their data will inform future guidelines. They also plan to extend their analyses to larger and more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings provide valuable clues for advancing our understanding and treatment of mental illness with greater precision," &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2025/12/10/sweeping-study-shows-similar-genetic-factors-underlie-multiple-psychiatric-disorders"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; geneticist Jordan Smoller, from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09820-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc58vw900go27nyfak702n7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Department of Health and Human Services is planning to overhaul the schedule of recommended vaccines for children in the US, a person familiar with the plans told CNN on Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000d3b6spljo55m7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The proposed new schedule would recommend fewer shots, bringing it closer in line with what’s recommended in other developed countries. The expectation is that the US schedule will be close to, if not identical to, recommendations in Denmark, according to the person, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about the matter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000e3b6sty2n2m2z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The plan has not been finalized and could still change. HHS had planned to make the announcement Friday afternoon, the person said, but it was pushed to 2026 so as not to conflict with White House plans to announce further efforts to lower drug costs through “Most Favored Nation” pricing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000f3b6swavnmumf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An HHS spokesperson declined to comment and referred questions to the agency’s earlier statement that it had postponed a “children’s health announcement” until next year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The planned overhaul comes weeks after President Donald Trump ordered officials to review the childhood vaccine schedule and weigh recommending fewer shots.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000h3b6se2x10v3f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is ridiculous!” Trump wrote earlier this month in a Truth Social post about the current US schedule. “That is why I have just signed a Presidential memorandum directing the Department of Health and Human Services to ‘FAST TRACK’ a comprehensive evaluation of Vaccine Schedules from other Countries around the World, and better align the U.S. Vaccine Schedule.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000i3b6sbzo4gfxj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a post on X, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded: “Thank you, Mr. President. We’re on it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000j3b6sgdjkjqmm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Denmark’s &lt;a href="https://vaccine-schedule.ecdc.europa.eu/Scheduler/ByCountry?SelectedCountryId=58&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=true&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=false&amp;amp;IncludeAdultAgeGroup=true&amp;amp;IncludeAdultAgeGroup=false" target="_blank"&gt;2025 vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;, published by the European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shows that the country vaccinates children against fewer infectious diseases than the US does.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000k3b6sk33a2xrg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Denmark doesn’t currently recommend immunization against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, for children; the US does. RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000l3b6s3r5exkbz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It also doesn’t recommend the rotavirus, hepatitis A, meningococcal, flu or chickenpox vaccines for children, while these vaccines are on &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html#table-1" target="_blank"&gt;the US schedule&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc590vo00003b6st3sjcigo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Why would we ever want to emulate that?” asked Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “They made a financial decision. They decided to allow that degree of suffering and hospitalization. They didn’t want to spend that much money per hospitalization prevented.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7pk5p00003b6sb986foh7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Peter Hotez, a pediatrician who directs the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, called the plan “a bit of a head scratcher.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc8a1nw00043b6s1po3kjry@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The administration’s focus on “Denmark’s system of socialism and universal healthcare … is interesting but out of character” with its rhetoric, he said in a text message.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc8a3kc00063b6sreze6lyi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “More likely, it’s part of DHHS’s consistent efforts to make vaccines unavailable to the American people. They cherry-picked Denmark because they administer the fewest vaccines of any Western country. And by going to Denmark’s system it affords them an opportunity to deprive Americans of vaccines for bacterial meningitis and rotavirus which are major causes of morbidity and mortality of America’s children. They’ve not done their epidemiological homework to realize how these are major illnesses in the U.S.,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc8a9oh00083b6sfazll7tu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s superficial, ideological, and incurious. The DHHS in this administration couldn’t care less if children suffer from disease as long as at it meets their ideological targets.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000m3b6s23mtpful@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg, newly named acting director of the US Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, gave a presentation on the Danish vaccine schedule at &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/health/cdc-advisers-hepatitis-b-vaccine"&gt;this month’s meeting&lt;/a&gt; of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000n3b6s5spqpl7u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think one of the reasons Denmark may do a better job at making their vaccine recommendations is, it’s not a politicized discussion,” said Hoeg, a dual citizen of the US and Denmark. She described a multiparty system, culture of debate and strong acknowledgment of knowns and unknowns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000o3b6s9igxwdnk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hoeg noted that with fewer vaccines, there’s less exposure to aluminum, which is used as an adjuvant — an ingredient added to create a stronger immune response. It’s used in several childhood vaccines because it enables doctors to give fewer doses, which requires a smaller amount of vaccine. Despite broad evidence that using aluminum-containing adjuvants in vaccines is safe, Kennedy has argued that aluminum in vaccines is linked to allergies and other health conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            During the CDC meeting, Dr. Adam Langer, the agency’s expert on hepatitis B, took issue with the Denmark comparison ahead of a significant change to hepatitis B vaccine recommendations for infants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000q3b6scvj2zk8f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The United States is a unique country,” he began. Of Denmark, he pointed out, “the entire country has 6 million people. The population of New York City alone is 8 million people.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “As a mother of children who were born in Denmark, moving to the United States, they were low-risk there, they were low-risk here. I couldn’t understand why you would use a vaccine in one country but not the other for the same level of risk,” she said. “I think the frustration maybe that American parents face is, if they know that their child is at low risk, why we as a country choose to try to vaccinate our way out of an imperfect health care system.”

But when the pain worsened and radiated down her leg and into her ankle, she sought medical help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her doctor suspected she had tendinitis - inflammation of the tendons, the thick cords that attach muscle to bones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While tendinitis, which affects hundreds of thousands of Americans every year, can come on suddenly after injury, most develop it from repetitive motions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors blamed the suspected condition on the 23-year-old being 5ft 9in tall and sitting in a salon chair all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The doctors had mentioned that it could be because of my job...' Bailey said&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. 'Some days were worse than others, and I tried to figure out what was triggering it, but at the time I didn't know what it was.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors referred her to physical therapy, but the pain worsened and left her unable to do the exercises. It took multiple doctor appointments over seven more months before a physician ordered an MRI scan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, in October 2025, the MRI revealed Bailey had two tumors: one in her femur and one in her groin. Soon after, she was diagnosed with stage four Ewing sarcoma, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14583791/teenager-killed-ewing-sarcoma-bone-cancer-sign.html"&gt;a rare cancer that grows in bone cells&lt;/a&gt; and the soft tissues surrounding the bones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brooke Bailey (pictured), a 23-year-old nail technician from Pennsylvania, suffered hip pain for months, which doctors insisted was due to her height and sitting at her job &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey is pictured above during cancer treatments. Doctors will determine in January whether she needs surgery alongside her current chemotherapy plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I never thought in my mind that it was cancer, so it was scary, but I kind of felt relieved, too, because I was like, "I'm not crazy. There is something wrong and I knew it the whole time,"' Bailey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was like, "What's next? I'm ready to start the healing process because I want my life back."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ewing sarcoma affects just 200 to 250 Americans every year, the vast majority of whom are children and young adults. It's unclear exactly how many annual deaths there are because the cancer is so rare, but experts estimate there are several dozen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The overall five-year survival rate is 81 percent, according to the American Cancer Society. If it spreads to other organs, that rate drops to 41 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stage four cancer means the disease has spread from its primary site - Bailey's cancer likely spread from her femur to her groin area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include bone pain, fractures, swelling or tenderness near the affected areas. Some patients may also feel a lump in their arm, leg, chest or pelvis, according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bailey is now undergoing six rounds of chemotherapy and will be assessed in January to determine if she needs surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her mother, Marissa Koons, has set up a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-brookes-fight-against-ewing-sarcoma"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; to help raise money for egg retrieval, as chemotherapy can destroy eggs and lead to infertility. The fundraiser also covers travel and accommodations for the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The circled sections in the above scan show tumors in Bailey's femur and groin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey's mother (pictured left with Bailey) set up a GoFundMe to help with her daughter's egg retrieval. They wanted to do the procedure so she can possibly have children in the future&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey (pictured) is undergoing treatment and is encouraging other young people to seek a second opinion if they feel something is wrong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We used that money for the egg retrieval because the insurance didn't cover that at all,' Koons said. '[The fundraiser] exceeded the goal, and we're at over $7,000 now, which has helped us to pay for the egg retrieval without me going into my credit card debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had to stay at a hotel for this round of chemo, the travel, prescriptions. It really did help, but most of it went to the egg retrieval because that really did need to be taken care of.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the meantime, Bailey is encouraging other young people to look for a second opinion if they are repeatedly dismissed by their doctors.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've learned that you really are your biggest advocate for yourself, and if you don't like what somebody says, go see somebody else,' she said. 'I wish that's what I had done. You are your [own] person, and you need to take care of yourself...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You really need to be kind of forceful when it comes to [advocating for yourself with doctors], which is sad. But if you know that there's something wrong with you, then you know. I knew that there was something wrong with me. I didn't know that it was cancer, but I knew deep down inside that there was something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think the biggest takeaway from this is to listen to your body.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As the world's population ages, the number of people living with dementias such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="186179" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the lack of curative treatments and the limited effectiveness of available medications, interest in new therapeutic approaches is growing. Among them are cannabinoids from the cannabis plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small new Brazilian study published in the international &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13872877251389608"&gt;Journal of Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; investigated the effects of microdoses of cannabis extract on patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. The results found positive effects, without the associated "high" of cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/compounds-in-cannabis-promote-healthy-aging-new-study-discovers"&gt;Compounds in Cannabis Promote Healthy Aging, New Study Discovers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The logic of microdoses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Professor Francisney Nascimento and colleagues at the &lt;a href="https://portal.unila.edu.br/"&gt;Federal University of Latin American Integration (UNILA)&lt;/a&gt;, recruited 24 elderly patients (60-80 years) diagnosed with mild Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It evaluated the effects of daily use of an oil prepared from cannabis extract containing THC and CBD in similar proportions and extremely low concentrations (0.3 mg of each cannabinoid). These sub-psychoactive doses do not cause the "high" associated with recreational use of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extract used was donated by &lt;a href="https://abraceesperanca.org.br/"&gt;ABRACE&lt;/a&gt;, Brazil's biggest patient association, and had no contribution from cannabis companies or other funding sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microdosing" is a term usually associated with recreational use of psychedelics. Given the size of the dose, it would be easy to question whether it could have any effect at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doses below 1 mg of the cannabinoid compounds are not frequently reported in the literature of clinical practice. However, the researchers' decision to use microdosing did not come out of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the group led by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Zimmer"&gt;Andreas Zimmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andras-Bilkei-Gorzo"&gt;Andras Bilkei-Gorzo&lt;/a&gt; had already demonstrated that very low doses of THC restored cognition in elderly mice, reversing gene expression patterns and brain synapse density in the hippocampus to levels similar to those of young animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186182" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186182" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/cannabis_extract_alzheimers_header-642x361.jpg" alt="cannabis extract" class="size-medium wp-image-186182" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/cannabis_extract_alzheimers_header-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/cannabis_extract_alzheimers_header-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/cannabis_extract_alzheimers_header-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/cannabis_extract_alzheimers_header.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186182" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Microdosing cannabis extract isn't frequently reported in the literature of clinical practice.

They found cognitive improvement, assessed using the Adas-Cog scale, a set of tasks using things like word recall to test cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This triggered the decision to run a more robust  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="186179" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; in human volunteers to verify the cognitive-enhancement effects observed in the volunteer. The second study was a properly &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41160460/"&gt;controlled, randomised, and double-blinded clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What we found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several clinical scales were used to objectively measure the impact of cannabis treatment. This time, the improvement was observed in the &lt;a href="https://muhc.ca/sites/default/files/micro/m-PT-OT/OT/Mini-Mental-State-Exam-%28MMSE%29.pdf"&gt;mini-mental state exam (MMSE) scale&lt;/a&gt;, a widely used scale for assessing cognitive function in patients with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a validated set of questions that are asked to the patient, with the aid of an accompanying person (typically a family member or helper). After 24 weeks of treatment, the group receiving the cannabis extract showed stabilisation in their scores, while the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="186179" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; group showed cognitive deterioration (worsening of Alzheimer's symptoms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact was modest but relevant; patients using cannabis microdosing scored two to three points higher than their placebo counterparts (full points on the MMSE is 30). In patients with preserved or moderately impaired cognitive function, it may be unrealistic to expect major changes in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis extracts did not improve other non-cognitive symptoms, like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="186179" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, general health, or overall quality of life. On the other hand, there was no difference in adverse side effects. This was likely due to the extremely low dose used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This result echoes findings from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-02208-1"&gt;my 2022 study&lt;/a&gt;, which found a reduction in endocannabinoid signalling during ageing, meaning ageing brains are more prone to cognitive degradation without the protection of the cannabinoids. Among other mechanisms, cannabinoids seem to protect cognition by reducing drivers of inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A new paradigm: cannabis without the 'high'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest obstacle to the acceptance of cannabis as a therapeutic tool in brain ageing is perhaps not scientific, but cultural. In many countries, the fear of "getting high" deters many patients and even healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But studies such as this show there are ways to get around this problem by using doses so low they do not cause noticeable changes in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/consciousness" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73104" data-postid="186179" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt;, but which can still modulate important biological systems, such as inflammation and neuroplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186187" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186187" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/brain_cells_microdosing_642.jpg" alt="neurons" class="wp-image-186187 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/brain_cells_microdosing_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/brain_cells_microdosing_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186187" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Low doses of certain drugs may modulate key brain systems without altering consciousness.

This could open the door to new formulations focused on prevention, especially in more vulnerable populations, such as elderly people with mild cognitive impairment or a family history of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What now?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its potential, the study also has important limitations: the sample size is small, and the effects were restricted to one dimension of the cognition scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the work represents an unprecedented step: it is the first clinical trial to successfully test the microdose approach in patients with Alzheimer's disease. It is a new way of looking at this plant in the treatment of important diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-6-key-depression-symptoms-that-predict-dementia-risk"&gt;Scientists Identify 6 Key Depression Symptoms That Predict Dementia Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To move forward, new studies with a larger number of participants, longer follow-up times, and in combination with biological markers (such as neuroimaging and inflammatory biomarkers) will be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only then will it be possible to answer the fundamental question: can cannabis slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease? We have taken an important step towards understanding this, but for now, the question remains unanswered.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271170/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;It probably sucked to be a Roman soldier guarding Hadrian’s Wall circa the third century CE. W.H. Auden imagined the likely harsh conditions in his poem “&lt;a href="https://hellopoetry.com/poem/788/roman-wall-blues/"&gt;Roman Wall Blues&lt;/a&gt;,” in which a soldier laments enduring wet wind and rain with “lice in my tunic and a cold in my nose.” We can now add chronic nausea and bouts of diarrhea to his list of likely woes, thanks to parasitic infections, according to a new paper published in the journal Parasitology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/02/this-ancient-roman-ceramic-pot-was-probably-a-portable-toilet-study-finds/"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, archaeologists can learn a great deal by studying the remains of intestinal parasites in ancient feces. For instance, in 2022, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/intestinal-parasites-plagued-jerusalems-wealthy-elite-toilet-excavation-reveals/"&gt;we reported&lt;/a&gt; on an analysis of soil samples collected from a stone toilet found within the ruins of a swanky 7th-century BCE villa just outside Jerusalem. That analysis revealed the presence of parasitic eggs from four different species: whipworm, beef/pork tapeworm, roundworm, and pinworm. (It’s the earliest record of roundworm and pinworm in ancient Israel.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that same year, researchers from the University of Cambridge and the University of British Columbia &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/02/this-ancient-roman-ceramic-pot-was-probably-a-portable-toilet-study-finds/"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; the residue on an ancient Roman ceramic pot excavated at the site of a 5th-century CE Roman villa at Gerace, a rural district in Sicily. They identified the eggs of intestinal parasitic worms commonly found in feces—strong evidence that the 1,500-year-old pot in question was most likely used as a chamber pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other prior studies have compared fecal parasites found in hunter-gatherer and farming communities, revealing dramatic dietary changes, as well as shifts in settlement patterns and social organization coinciding with the rise of agriculture. This latest paper analyzes sediment collected from sewer drains at the Roman fort at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindolanda"&gt;Vindolanda&lt;/a&gt;, located just south of the defense fortification known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall"&gt;Hadrian’s Wall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An antiquarian named William Camden recorded the existence of the ruins in a 1586 treatise. Over the next 200 years, many people visited the site, discovering a military bathhouse in 1702 and an altar in 1715.  Another altar found in 1914 confirmed that the fort had been called Vindolanda. Serious archaeological excavation at the site began in the 1930s. The site is most famous for the so-called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindolanda_tablets" data-uri="3b2e6e2a335fbdd9d5b162bf089157b0"&gt;Vindolanda tablets,&lt;/a&gt; among the oldest surviving handwritten documents in the UK—and for the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/touch-wood-luck-protection-power-or-pleasure-a-wooden-phallus-from-vindolanda-roman-fort/53F4B0838D23DB65F6A244695624102E"&gt;2023 discovery&lt;/a&gt; of what appeared to be an ancient Roman dildo, although &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/remember-that-ancient-roman-dildo-it-might-just-be-an-old-roman-drop-spindle/"&gt;others argued&lt;/a&gt; the phallus-shaped artifact was more likely to be a drop spindle used for spinning yarn.&lt;/p&gt;

Both occurred within the past month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEmbed_videoEmbed__Qn_0f"&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEmbed_videoContainer__Pe1Y5"&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEmbed_placeholder__5VC9v"&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEmbed_spinner__oFTUn"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEmbed_caption__o_5xL"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin health officials announced Thursday that two children in the state, including one from Northeast Wisconsin, have died from respiratory illnesses so far this season. (WLUK)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a news conference, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services did not say how old the children were, but shared the child who died of the flu was from the northeast region of Wisconsin and the child who died of COVID was from the western part of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said they are working to confirm whether the children were vaccinated. Both had some underlying conditions that increased their risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DHS is urging everyone, especially young children, older adults, people with chronic health conditions, and women who are pregnant,&lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/immunization/vaccine-facts.htm" target="_blank"&gt; to get vaccinated &lt;/a&gt;for flu, RSV and COVID-19. Six months is the earliest a child can be vaccinated for these illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We really do want people to consider that these tragedies can happen and the best way to prevent these things is, obviously, to get vaccinated as quickly as possible. With the holidays coming up and the get-togethers with the relatives, friends, we really encourage people to get the vaccine for both COVID and also for influenza," said DHS Respiratory Disease Epidemiologist Tom Haupt. "It's not too late and it's a safe vaccine and it's still in plentiful supply."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="YouTubeEmbed_youTubeEmbed__ygKv1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haupt said the current COVID and flu vaccine rates for Wisconsin children is "very low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want them to be increased significantly. To be honest with you, it's kind of disappointing, the numbers that have come in," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all ages in Wisconsin, the flu vaccine status sits at only 28% right now and at just 10.6% for COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We really want people to realize how severe influenza is.

The funding is for a study on hepatitis B vaccines that some experts say may be unethical and is unlikely to generate data relevant to use of the vaccine in this country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Christine Stabell Benn and her husband, Peter Aaby, lead the Bandim Health Project, a research site located in Guinea-Bissau in West Africa. The CDC has awarded them a grant to &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;run a placebo-controlled trial of the hepatitis B vaccine&lt;/a&gt; in newborns. Guinea-Bissau currently gives babies their first hepatitis B vaccine dose at 6 weeks of age, not birth. It plans to adopt a universal birth dose policy, which is recommended by the World Health Organization, in 2027. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The award is in response to an “unsolicited proposal,” according to &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-23245.pdf?utm_campaign=pi+subscription+mailing+list&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=federalregister.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; in the Federal Register. The University of Southern Denmark, where Stabell Benn and Aaby are employed, confirmed to STAT that they are the recipients of the CDC grant. Stabell Benn has not responded to STAT’s interview requests. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Few details of the study design have been released. But &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; from the Bandim Health Project said some babies will be randomly assigned to receive a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine at birth while others will receive the current standard of care to test for “overall health outcomes.” The statement from the CDC said the goal of the trial is to assess the hepatitis B birth dose’s impact on “early-life mortality, morbidity, and long-term developmental outcomes.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One vaccine expert told STAT that the projected length of the study — the funding is for five years — seemed well suited to capture potential risks of the vaccine but would be unable to quantify the benefits. That’s because the harms of being infected with hepatitis B early in infancy do not become apparent until later in life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The benefit of hepatitis B vaccine isn’t seen until decades later,” said William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center and professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “This is not a study designed to look at the benefits of the birth dose of hepatitis B, unless they’re looking for chronic hepatitis B infection, but they don’t explicitly say that.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, a panel that advises the CDC on vaccine policy &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/05/cdc-hepatitis-b-vaccination-acip-panel-overturns-30-year-policy/"&gt;voted to recommend&lt;/a&gt; doing away with the country’s universal hepatitis B vaccine birth dose policy. The decades-old policy, which was supported by myriad studies, has been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/11/newborn-hep-b-vaccine-debate-how-it-started/"&gt;credited with driving down rates of hepatitis B infection in U.S. babies by 99%&lt;/a&gt;. Babies infected with the virus at birth or in their first year of life run a 90% risk of developing chronic hepatitis B infection, a condition that might not be diagnosed for years. About a quarter of those who do go on to die prematurely of liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Critics of the recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — which was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/16/hepatitis-b-vaccine-cdc-acip-recommendation-meets-resistance/"&gt;accepted this week by acting CDC Director Jim O’Neill&lt;/a&gt; — noted the change was not prompted by new evidence of dangers associated with the vaccine, or data questioning the effectiveness of the vaccine, but rather the objections of some parents to the policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stabell Benn and Aaby have long claimed some vaccines have impacts beyond protecting against a specific pathogen — so-called nonspecific effects. In some cases, they claim those effects are beneficial. But in others, they have reported negative nonspecific events. For instance, they suggest use of the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7252419/pdf/41577_2020_Article_338.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hepatitis B vaccine&lt;/a&gt; increases a child’s susceptibility to other pathogens, an effect they say is particularly apparent among girls. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012344?dgcid=author#bi0005" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;An analysis of their studies&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year called into question many of the pair’s findings, saying they often claimed nonspecific effects that reexamination of the data did not support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is not known if the study the CDC is funding has cleared ethics approval at the University of Southern Denmark or by the health ministry of Guinea-Bissau.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But vaccine experts raised concern that randomly assigning some children not to be vaccinated at birth — especially in a country like Guinea-Bissau, which has a high prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection — may be unethical. Some studies — several of which Aaby co-authored — have estimated between 13% and 18% of people in Guinea-Bissau are infected with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They are putting children at risk — and not an insubstantial proportion of children at risk — by not giving a birth dose,” Moss said. “This will obviously have to go through ethical review. I suspect it hasn’t done that yet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other experts questioned the idea of exposing children in a low-income country to a risk that one could not expose children to here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If the study design cannot be done in the United States because withholding the hepatitis B vaccine from newborns would violate ethical standards, then that raises serious concerns if the design is applied to infants in a lower-resource setting such as Guinea-Bissau,” said Zachary Rubin, a pediatrician and allergist-immunologist in the Chicago area.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;STAT asked the Department of Health and Human Services if it was ethical to conduct a study involving children in a low-income country that could not be conducted in the United States. In an emailed reply, spokesperson Emily Hilliard sidestepped that question, but insisted “we will ensure the highest scientific and ethical standards are met.” The study, Hilliard said, is designed “to fill existing evidence gaps to help inform global hepatitis B vaccine policy.’’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the differences between Guinea-Bissau and high-income countries like the United States are so substantial that any results seen there are not likely to be applicable here, a number of scientists warned. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Guinea-Bissau and the United States differ significantly in terms of infant mortality rates, causes of death, health care access, infectious disease burden, and maternal screening rates,” Rubin noted. “Even if the study determined that there was higher all-cause mortality in the vaccine group, that would not necessarily apply to the risk of the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose in American infants.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moss agreed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Those children in Guinea-Bissau are exposed to a whole different range and magnitude of pathogens that a child in the United States would not have,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researcher Stabell Benn has close ties to Høeg, an adviser to FDA Commissioner Marty Makary &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/11/tracy-beth-hoeg-fda-cder-director-faces-staff-mistrust/"&gt;who was recently named acting director of the agency’s drug center&lt;/a&gt;. The two have co-hosted a podcast together called “Vaccine Curious” where they compare vaccine policies in the U.S. and Denmark. Høeg is also the FDA’s representative on the CDC’s ACIP panel, where she recently pushed for the U.S. to reduce the number of vaccines it gives newborns. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stabell Benn &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/19/tracy-beth-hoeg-fda-advisor-marty-makary-vinay-prasad-vaccine-policy/"&gt;told STAT in April&lt;/a&gt; that she would like regulators to raise the bar on vaccines. She suggested asking companies to prove not only that their products introduce antibodies or reduce the risk of the target illness, but that they improve overall health.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is a misunderstood fear that if we start digging down and scrutinizing vaccine effects on overall health, then we might reveal something that could shatter confidence,” Stabell Benn said. “But it’s really not the way to deal with uncertainty. To say that if we are so afraid of what we are finding, we will just not study it. I can’t see any excuse.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stabell Benn and Aaby founded the Bandim Health Project group in 1978. Aaby was an anthropologist studying malnutrition when a measles outbreak hit and his team started vaccinating 1,500 children. The children didn’t die and in fact their mortality rate declined threefold compared to unvaccinated children, he recounted to &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/food/2019/12/vaccines-best-medicine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/a&gt; in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That experience made the two want to study the overall health effects of vaccines, both positive and negative. Kennedy has repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LJXPOv4SM" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cited their research in interviews&lt;/a&gt;, particularly &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28188123/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an observational study&lt;/a&gt; showing an increase in mortality among children who received the DTP vaccine, which prevents diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The couple has &lt;a href="https://www.weekendavisen.dk/2025-08/samfund/et-daarligt-immunforsvar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;come under fire in the Danish press&lt;/a&gt; for failing to publish the results of a &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00244673?id=NCT00244673&amp;amp;rank=1&amp;amp;a=5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;separate randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; they ran on the DTP vaccine in 2011, while touting the results of the observational study. Fellow Danish researchers have expressed &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X25012344" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;skepticism&lt;/a&gt; of the Bandim Health Project’s methods and conclusions, according to &lt;a href="https://www.weekendavisen.dk/ideer/en-udoedelig-hypotese" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;articles from Weekendavidsen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The couple told Weekendavidsen that they never published the results of the randomized trial due to a Ph.D. student’s pregnancy and the death of her field supervisor. The student “didn’t have time for long-term follow-up, and we didn’t have new resources to continue,” they said. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"When I was in my emergency medical services (EMS) class, my teacher brought in a death investigator and former autopsy examiner to speak to our class. She told us that while she worked as an autopsy examiner, she got this women who at the time mysteriously suffocated after a car accident. Apparently this women was driving, and while she was driving, she grabbed her lighter from her purse and was holding it in her mouth while she fumbled through her bag for her cigarettes. While doing this, she got T-boned. The airbag went off, and on the way to hospital, they kept trying to put tubes down her throat to open her airway, because she was having trouble breathing. But no luck. When they cut open her throat during the autopsy, they found her lighter jammed down there. Apparently when the airbag went off it got jammed down her throat and no one knew."&lt;/span&gt;

All the patients received a standard, initial immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy between May 2019 and October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each patient's average treatment time of day was calculated based on the first four therapy cycles. The researchers then compared survival outcomes for patients treated at different times of day, between 11 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. They matched the patients to ensure that the main thing that differed between them was the treatment timing, not baseline characteristics, such as age or sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 p.m. marked a critical cutoff point. Patients who generally received treatment before 3 p.m. survived significantly longer without their &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/cancer-facts-about-the-diseases-that-cause-out-of-control-cell-growth" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/cancer-facts-about-the-diseases-that-cause-out-of-control-cell-growth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; progressing. They also had longer overall survival over the next five years, compared with those treated later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after accounting for other factors that could influence the patients' outcomes, this earlier treatment time remained a strong, independent predictor of better survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study findings align with laboratory studies that suggest killer T cells — immune cells that can directly kill cancer — tend to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-abstract/84/17/2756/747056/Clocking-Cancer-Immunotherapy-ResponsesTiming?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-abstract/84/17/2756/747056/Clocking-Cancer-Immunotherapy-ResponsesTiming?redirectedFrom=fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;migrate into tumors in the morning&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bdp.jhu.edu/bd-professors/chi-van-dang/" target="_blank" data-url="https://bdp.jhu.edu/bd-professors/chi-van-dang/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Chi Van Dang&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of cancer medicine at Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved in the study. Therefore, aligning immunotherapy with this migration may help it work better, he told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-74a0ba1c-be1d-4b83-9e03-16dc9a635b44" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="personalized-chronotherapy-3"&gt;Personalized 'chronotherapy'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="e3cffbce-6015-4873-8c94-680a91a2274a"&gt;The large sample size of the study was a strength, but the research has some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lévi pointed out that most patients were men, for example. The pronounced timing effects did not seem to extend to the women in the study, but this may come down to there being few women included, the study authors wrote, so it bears exploring in larger studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that patients who received immunochemotherapy before 3 p.m. lived nearly twice as long as those treated later in the afternoon. However, this picture isn't completely clear, Lévi said, because the study doesn't pinpoint the best cutoff time for care. "This results in an uncertainty regarding the most appropriate cut off time, that actually could be located between 11:30 and 15:00," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, because the study looked back at past patient data, stronger evidence will still need to come from randomized clinical trials, in which different treatment timings are explicitly tested and compared against one another. Most evidence of the benefits of early treatment "comes from retrospective studies," Innominato and colleagues said, "with only &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2025.43.16_suppl.8516" target="_blank" data-url="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2025.43.16_suppl.8516" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one prospective trial completed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and additional trials now in development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming trials show positive results, there could still be logistical hurdles to overcome. "If treatment were restricted to a single time window, such as the morning, clinical units could quickly become overwhelmed," Innominato and colleagues said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="cbc8e5d7-69bc-456e-9744-8e2e0282bbc5"&gt;It's important to note that the "optimal window" for treatment may not be universal among patients, they added. It may partially depend on each individual's biological rhythms and lifestyle characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronotyping — categorizing people as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/can-night-owls-become-early-birds.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/can-night-owls-become-early-birds.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;"morning larks" or a "night owls”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — could "align therapy with each patient's internal clock, accounting for individual variability and thus boosting efficacy while easing pressure on clinical units by distributing treatments across the day," they suggested. "The challenge now is to develop quick, reliable ways to identify chronotype and scale this approach, and dedicated studies are already underway."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="6401208e-96ee-4493-ae87-0120da614927"&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;After taking a shot at becoming a neuroscience biotech, buzzy Bay Area AI outfit Verge Genomics is dropping its only clinical asset and returning to its drug discovery roots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision comes after VRG50635, the company’s lead asset for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), failed a pre-specified efficacy analysis in a &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06215755"&gt;phase 1 trial&lt;/a&gt;, Effie Bruzik, Verge’s vice president of operations, told Fierce Biotech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A no-go decision was made,” Bruzik said, so the trial was terminated and did not advance to an open-label extension stage. On clinicaltrials.gov, the reason given for the termination is “lack of risk-benefit data.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="ad-container"&gt;
      &lt;dynamic-ad-slot pos="14" placeholder-id="nativeAdUnitPos14" :randomize-element-id="true" ad-id="nativeAdUnitPos14" :hide-on-desktop="false" :hide-on-mobile="false" :container-size-map="[[1,1]]" :sizes="[['fluid']]" class="inline-native-ad pos-14" :class="{ 'mobile-ad': false }"&gt;&lt;/dynamic-ad-slot&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  

      &lt;p class="ad-container"&gt;
      &lt;dynamic-ad-slot :pos="8" :out-of-page="true" placeholder-id="content-embed-one" ad-id="contentEmbedOne" :hide-on-desktop="0" :hide-on-mobile="0"&gt;&lt;/dynamic-ad-slot&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;The move away from VRG50635 leaves a preexisting deal with Ferrer in limbo. The Spanish pharma &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/ferrer-signs-122m-biobucks-deal-ex-us-license-verges-phase-1-als-therapy"&gt;licensed the ex-U.S. rights&lt;/a&gt; to the ALS asset in March 2024 in a pact potentially worth more than 112.5 million euros (then worth roughly $121.7 million).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruzik did not respond to questions from Fierce Biotech about the status of Verge’s deal with Ferrer. At the time of publication, Ferrer had not responded to Fierce's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With no more candidates in the clinic, Verge is pivoting to focus solely on its machine learning drug discovery platform &lt;a href="https://www.vergegenomics.com/approach"&gt;Converge&lt;/a&gt;, Bruzik added.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;dynamic-ad-slot :pos="11" placeholder-id="ad-slot-2_mobile" ad-id="adSlot2Mobile" :hide-on-desktop="1" :hide-on-mobile="0" :container-size-map="[[1,1]]" :sizes="[[300, 250],[320,50]]"&gt;&lt;/dynamic-ad-slot&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;“Recent breakthroughs in AI foundation models has meaningfully increased demand for Verge’s multi-modal human datasets in the last 18 months, and we see a clear opportunity to drive industry-wide impact by enabling partners to improve pipeline success rates,” Bruzik said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verge intends to use a “leaner cost structure” and continued investment in its technology to scale up Converge as a means to achieve “sustainable profitability,” Bruzik explained. The company plans to divulge more details on the “strategic re-focus,” including new hires, early next year, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VRG50635 itself was originally discovered with Converge, and the tech company’s success at bringing an AI-discovered candidate into the clinic earned Verge a spot on the &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/special-reports/fierce-biotechs-2022-fierce-15#bc74093d-d80b-4bd4-aae8-7df95cee3341"&gt;Fierce 15&lt;/a&gt; list in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2015, Verge raised a  &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/verge-genomics-gathers-32m-to-trial-its-ai-built-neuroscience-drugs"&gt;$32 million series A&lt;/a&gt;  in 2018 and then tripled it to &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/als-drug-discoverer-verge-genomics-signs-merck-lilly-nearly-100m-oversubscribed-funding"&gt;$98 million&lt;/a&gt; for a December 2021 series B that saw Eli Lilly and Merck pitch in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10" class="olytics_injection"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lilly was already a known friend of Verge, dropping &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/eli-lilly-taps-verge-genomics-als-deal-worth-25m-upfront"&gt;$25 million upfront&lt;/a&gt; on the AI company in July 2021 to pursue new ALS candidates. AstraZeneca &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/astrazeneca-converges-verges-ai-tech-42m-rare-neurodegenerative-disease-rd-pact"&gt;followed with $42 million&lt;/a&gt; for an R&amp;amp;D pact of its own in September 2023. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Green tea is a top mood booster. Its amino acids (l-theanine and arginine) and antioxidants (like EGCG) support brain and gut health, reduce inflammation, and may help improve mood and lower anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peppermint, chamomile, and lavender teas can lift your mood, promote relaxation, and reduce stress, making them ideal for evening routines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ritual matters as much as the tea. Simply brewing and sipping a warm cup provides hydration, a soothing sensory experience, and a mental reset that can improve overall well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When a bad mood strikes—or when you’ve been in a slump for a few days—it’s easy to fall back on less-than-&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-habits-that-could-actually-shorten-your-lifespan-11743704" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;healthy habits&lt;/a&gt;, whether that’s scrolling, reaching for indulgent snacks, or being sassy towards loved ones. However, there are plenty of healthier activities, foods, and beverages that can help turn your bad mood on its head—and one of them is simply brewing a warm cup of tea. “The act of making tea can be as beneficial as the tea itself,” says &lt;a href="https://www.rachellerobinett.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Rachelle Robinett&lt;/a&gt;, registered herbalist and author of &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/753977/naturally-by-rachelle-robinett/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Naturally, The Herbalist’s Guide to Health and Transformation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That said, the type of tea in your mug can have positive impacts on your mood, too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there are several mood-boosting teas to choose from, some stand out above the rest for their accessibility and research backing. Here we’ll tease out one of the best (and a few runners-up), so the next time you’re feeling grumpy, you can reach for a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/calming-caffeine-free-teas-8755949" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;warm cup of tea&lt;/a&gt; to elevate your mood.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-best-mood-boosting-tea"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; The Best Mood-Boosting Tea &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But of all the tea varieties, which is the best for mood-boosting? While several will help you turn that frown upside down, green tea ranks high on the list. “&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/green-tea-vs-black-tea-11822262" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Green tea&lt;/a&gt; is a great option to support your brain health and may even help slow down aging of the brain&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; thanks to the stress-reducing impact of the amino acids l-theanine and arginine,” says &lt;a href="http://www.wellnesswhisk.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Maxine Yeung&lt;/a&gt;, RD CPT NBHWC, dietitian and founder of The Wellness Whisk, LLC. “It’s loaded with antioxidant catechins, particularly EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), which help reduce inflammation, have neuroprotective properties, and are linked with a lower risk for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Green tea&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; may also have a positive impact on gut microbiota.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Outside of boosting brain and gut health—inadvertently supporting mood—the high concentration of EGCG in green tea also offers research-backed mood benefits. “Polyphenols, like EGCG, help to raise your mood&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by influencing mood-related neurotransmitters, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/anti-inflammatory-lifestyle-habits-11769931" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;reducing inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, regulating the stress response, and supporting the gut-brain axis,” Yeung adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The amino acid l-theanine in this popular tea has also been shown&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to reduce symptoms of anxiety and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/calming-foods-8766006" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;promote feelings of relaxation&lt;/a&gt;. “Additionally, some clinical trials&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have found that bioactive compounds in green tea may improve mood by lowering inflammation and improving sleep quality,” says registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://dietitiankerry.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kerry Hackworth&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, LDN. Research&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has even found the aroma of green tea alone to elicit positive emotions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, green tea does contain caffeine, which—while &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/energy-boosting-beverages-11681250" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;providing an energy boost&lt;/a&gt;, potentially benefiting mood in some—isn’t ideal for those sensitive to the stimulant or those needing support during the later hours of the day or night. You can find decaffeinated green tea, but the decaffeination process may reduce&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; its mood-boosting polyphenol content. This is where an herbal tea could be a better choice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just one delicious, mood-boosting option is mint—or peppermint—tea. “Mint or peppermint is a caffeine-free and calming bedtime beverage,” Hackworth says. “Mint tea and honey makes an excellent sick-day pick-me-up for me personally.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yeung agrees, adding, “I love reaching for mint tea when I need a little pick-me-up. The menthol aroma instantly helps wake me up, clear my mind, and boost my energy.” Research backs this, showing the brain health&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, relaxation, and anxiety-reduction&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; benefits of mint tea. Robinett and these RDs also mention chamomile&lt;span data-cite="10" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and lavender&lt;span data-cite="11" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as equally delicious and effective mood-supportive alternatives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So the next time you’re feeling anxious, down, or irritable, try brewing any one of these teas for a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-boost-mood-naturally-8756244" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;natural and comforting mood boost&lt;/a&gt;! While green, mint, chamomile, and lavender are all excellent options, choosing a variety you personally love can boost your mood simply because you enjoy the taste and sensory experience. “It's worth taking a moment to consider what teas are most enjoyable for us personally,” Robinett suggests.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are countless varieties of tea—which generally fit into two categories: tea and tisane (better known as herbal tea). “Tea is, as we know, a water-based infusion (or extract) wherein plant-based benefits seep out of herbs and into our cup, and we toss the spent remnants and sip the benefits,” Robinett says. “Technically, though, all tea isn’t tea—only infusions made from the tea plant, &lt;em&gt;Camellia sinensis&lt;/em&gt;, are tea; everything else is a &lt;em&gt;tisane&lt;/em&gt;.” Common &lt;em&gt;Camellia sinensis&lt;/em&gt; teas include black, green, white, red, oolong, and yellow teas—the most popular teas nationwide. Tisane, or herbal tea, is a more unfamiliar territory for many of us, and there are countless herbs that can be brewed into tea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regardless of which variety you gravitate towards, tea’s far-reaching health benefits can usually be traced back to a specific type of nutrient. “Camellia sinensis and herbal teas are rich in antioxidants, particularly polyphenols and flavonoids, which promote multiple health benefits from heart health to metabolic health to brain health,” Yeung says. In fact, polyphenols in tea may help reduce&lt;span data-cite="12" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the risk of cardiovascular disease, lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels, improve blood sugar control, and lower cancer risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-with-more-antioxidants-than-blueberries-11773725" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; may also boost mood&lt;span data-cite="13" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and brain health&lt;span data-cite="14" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, depending on the variety. Other elements of the tea-drinking experience, like boosting fluid intake, also bode well for mental health. “Tea is also a good way to hydrate, providing minimal calories in exchange for fluid and healthy compounds,” Hackworth adds. Proper hydration benefits nearly every body system—including the brain and gut—both of which have a significant impact&lt;span data-cite="15" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on our mood.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, the act of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-tea-to-drink-daily-8608683" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;drinking tea&lt;/a&gt; alone can lift your spirits. “Simply sipping a warm cup of tea can feel incredibly calming. It’s a soothing ritual that fits perfectly into an evening wind-down routine, or even works as a quick stress relief strategy whenever you need to pause and reset,” Yeung offers.

A "clean sweep" of the board was needed "to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science," Kennedy wrote in a Wall Street Journal guest column.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan's chief medical executive, said on Thursday that public health experts across the country were not in agreement with the recent federal vaccine recommendations issued by the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"As the state’s chief medical executive, it is my duty to protect and promote public health, and I find the vaccine schedule recommendations produced by the AAP and AAFP well-evidenced and based on rigorous review," Badgasarian said.

                                &lt;p&gt;MADISON, Wis. -- Two Wisconsin children died from respiratory illnesses, the Department of Health Services confirmed Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One child died from COVID-19 and the other died from influenza. They are the first children to die of a respiratory illness during the current respiratory virus season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a reminder about how serious these viruses can be, but it's not too late to protect yourself and your family by getting vaccinated," DHS Respiratory Disease Epidemiologist Tom Haupt said. "Respiratory vaccines are safe, effective, and the best tool we have to prevent doctor visits, hospitalization, and death for Wisconsinites."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can schedule a vaccine through your primary care provider, local health department, pharmacy or community clinic. The &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/immunization/vfc-parent.htm"&gt;Vaccines for Children program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/immunization/vfa.htm"&gt;Vaccines for Adults program&lt;/a&gt; have also been set up to help those without insurance cover the costs of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to take steps to stop the spread of germs during the times of year when respiratory viruses are more prevalent. The DHS recommends Wisconsinites:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid touching their nose, eyes, and mouth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay home and away from others if feeling sick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid being around others who are sick or have flu symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing and encourage children to do the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear a high-quality mask around others to prevent the spread of respiratory illness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;​COPYRIGHT 2025 BY CHANNEL 3000.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjbn4ue1005e3b79d722fxj9@published"&gt;I am a 54-year-old man who has been married for 20-plus years to a 50-year-old woman. I had a pretty active sex life before we met, and she had some experience, but mostly just a few hook-ups, that, by her recollection, were mostly her opening her legs and letting the guy finish hurriedly. She claims that her first non-solo climax was with me and that was one reason she continued seeing me, leading to a very deep bond. Similarly, while she wasn’t particularly sexually adventurous, she was open to various positions and, honestly, after experiencing a pretty good sample size, I found her vulva and vagina to feel, taste, and look better than others.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="20" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjbmlizd00123b79cr861v17@published"&gt;While our frequency has declined over the years, our weekly (sometimes semi-weekly!) sex is generally fine, except for one thing.&lt;/p&gt;

    


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjbni75c006q3b79ga05q5to@published"&gt;Her vagina is too loose now, and I have trouble getting enough friction to cum. This is new to me, because while I am not much longer than average, I had always been told that my erections are much thicker than other guys’ and had always found every partner to be “tight.” Would 25 years of active sex “stretch” her out?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjbmlj1200133b79dypujxy3@published"&gt;This has been building for a few years, and yes, now that I am older, it takes a little bit more “action” for me to finish. We’ve tried various positions and some work better than others, but in general, it just gets tiresome thrusting away as she visibly loses interest a few minutes after her orgasm (which happens in all but our most hurried sessions). While she will give some half-hearted licks, she doesn’t like giving oral—especially after penetration—and we tried anal a couple of times, but neither of us is really into that. So most of our sessions end with me jacking off next to her, while she is obviously content and thinking about other things, which sometimes kills the vibe completely.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="115" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjbmlj3700143b79ofpz18zt@published"&gt;I’ve mentioned to her a few times to “try to squeeze it,” but she just sort of laughs it off, which also tracks with her generally viewing sex as something that the man puts most of the effort into. Plus, while I enjoy taking the lead in bed, I don’t like telling her what to do sexually or otherwise. I don’t want to hurt her feelings, and this isn’t the most important thing, but I’ve had trouble getting the point across that now that we are older, I need her to put a little more effort into it, whether that be Kegels, something to tighten up, or more active participation in our sessions. Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

His sentence, “And this isn’t the most important thing,” is perfunctory and performative. I feel like the writer had a sense that people might judge the language used and the issue at hand, and felt like he had to say it’s not that important.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="21" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjbmug2t001b3b792ubt1q29@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich Juzwiak: &lt;/strong&gt;Right. It’s important for our purposes: It’s the focus of the letter, and that’s what we’re here to address.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjbmuhu1001h3b792ulsb8wk@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s also clearly pretty important for him. Would 25 years of sex stretch her out? That’s not how things work. Also, our writer likely had very little opportunity to learn in his lifetime whether that is or is not how things work. But both sexes tend to lose pelvic floor tone as they age, regardless of how much sex they’ve had, how big any penises might have been, whether pregnancy has happened and a woman has given birth, fisting, orgasming, etc. It’s just age. Often, women who have given birth are given access to the tools to maintain pelvic floor function as part of the recovery process.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjbmuk4f001n3b79u8e59tl9@published"&gt;My biggest concern at the moment is how to get the wife into the kind of doctor who can evaluate whether some pelvic floor therapy needs to happen, regardless of how the sex is going to feel for this guy. When you get into your 60s and 70s, if you don’t have a strong pelvic floor, stuff can start to prolapse, you can have urinary and bowel leakage, it’s not a good scene, and it’s a lot easier to intervene earlier than to be like, “I’m 70, and I can’t control my pelvic floor.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjbmumhg001t3b798xajsuu2@published"&gt;In order to achieve that, I’m pretty sure he’s going to have to put sexual satisfaction on a shelf and just focus on saying, “I think this is something you should mention to your doctor.” He can do that with the knowledge that it’s likely to help her pelvis tighten back up. But often, in these kinds of discussions, if you portray it as just kind of a sex thing, the person who’s not particularly invested in sex is going to dismiss it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjbmuq8m001z3b79zahotwr2@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, it’ll just seem selfish and insulting. But that’s why I think the letter writer has to position himself as an expert. There’s nobody who knows the feel of her vagina as he does; they’re monogamous. Also, hormonal changes can create a different kind of effect. What he is feeling in terms of looseness is an estimate; it’s his assessment. He’s not the expert on what’s going on; he’s just the expert in the fact that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; is going on. He can tell her that he’s noticed something’s a little bit different, and so she might want to get that looked at.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="137" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjbmutzn002b3b79codyhevs@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;Exactly. Obviously, a PDE5 inhibitor would be useful in keeping you at full mast. You will shrink sometimes because there’s just not as much blood going into your dick, so if you can get that going using some medication, then you may retain your previous max size, and maybe that would actually give you a change in sensation as well. In a long session like that, especially with a partner who’s kind of just going along for the ride, there can be a distracting element of, “Well, this isn’t ideal in terms of the titillation I’m feeling, so is my erection going to go away?” Then that gets into your head, and it affects the sex. So that’s why the ED drugs are useful beyond the blood flow; they help with the psychology of it sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

And I always prefer when men who enjoy sex with women err on the side of prioritizing the woman’s orgasm. That said, in the same way that when I’m having sex with a man, I know once they have an orgasm, my fun is finished, so I kind of factor for that, he might consider trying to aim for sex where she doesn’t orgasm until right before he’s about to, and that’s probably going to result in her staying engaged throughout. Lots of women do have one orgasm and go, “Yeah, I’m done now.” I would roll over and go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjbmuxk1002n3b799ux9p3va@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;Right. And I understand that these issues are important for the writer, but look, you’re having regular sex decades into your relationship, and she’s coming. What he describes in terms of her coming and then he’s jacking himself off is a really common thing that happens. I see it a lot myself in my own experiences. In terms of gay male sex, bottoms, if they come, a lot of the time, they can’t keep taking the dick; it’s just too much, and so then the top finishes himself off. Of course, you want people to be engaged and to enjoy that along with you until the end, but there are worse things. The way that they’ve sorted it out is what I would recommend. So yes, this isn’t optimal. I understand you want it to be even better, but a little perspective is called for. It’s still pretty damn good.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s rare for both people to have the Bridgerton-style, coming at the same time kind of moment.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjbmv1d6002z3b79al3gdm8w@published"&gt;We can often get these scripts in our heads of how sex is supposed to play out. In the context of a long-term relationship, you can develop a very specific and almost rigid routine. So keep in mind you don’t have to adhere to a routine that isn’t working. You also don’t have to switch to one other routine. Sometimes she finishes, and you’re there jacking off. Sometimes you aim for her to orgasm just before you do. Maybe every once in a while it doesn’t happen for her, that’s probably going to be OK, and sometimes you can do other things.&lt;/p&gt;

This is one of those letters that’s not the template. You don’t want to go into a lot of this stuff just for the sake of being heard; you don’t want to hurt her feelings and shut her down.&lt;/p&gt;

I would really love it if you’d mention that to your primary care or gynecologist next time you see them.” Then, when addressing the sex, do your best to make it a neutral issue. Err on the side of it being your own issue. If it’s true that his erections are not as firm as five, 10 years ago, use that, just because this kind of stuff is not easy to hear, especially for women who are aging and don’t really have that much of an investment in sexual pleasure to begin &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Intwala, MD,&lt;/a&gt; a preventive cardiologist with Nuvance Health in New York, says that high cholesterol often flies under the radar. Even if you’re young and in good shape, if your diet and lifestyle habits don’t support healthy cholesterol levels, it will catch up with you. “You can be lean, fit, and young, and still silently be accumulating plaque in your arteries,” Dr. Intwala says. “Your arteries don’t care how good your &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/vo2-max-2"&gt;VO2max&lt;/a&gt; is.

Here’s the good news: It’s completely controllable, and the sooner you have cholesterol-supporting habits in place, the better.

Bradley, MD, FACC&lt;/a&gt;, a preventive cardiologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, roughly 20 to 30% of high cholesterol is controllable through diet and lifestyle habits. The rest, she says, comes down to whether you are genetically predisposed to have high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bradley says that roughly one in 250 people has a genetic disorder called &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/genetic-conditions/familial-hypercholesterolemia-fh"&gt;familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)&lt;/a&gt;, an inherited disorder leading to extremely high LDL cholesterol and must be treated with medication, along with diet and lifestyle interventions. “You can be the picture of health on the outside, but still have really dangerous levels of LDL cholesterol,” she says, emphasizing that this is why it’s important for everyone to have their cholesterol levels checked at least every couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-lower-your-cholesterol"&gt;the 20% and 30% that is in your control&lt;/a&gt;, all three cardiologists we spoke to advise a combination of not smoking, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-many-days-a-week-should-you-work-out-2#:~:text=In%20real%20life%2C%20GQ's%20fitness,and%20abilities%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20says."&gt;exercising regularly&lt;/a&gt;, and following a heart-healthy diet. Dr. Bradley is a big advocate of following the &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/what-is-mediterranean-diet-3"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, which has been repeatedly scientifically shown to keep LDL cholesterol low.

					&lt;p&gt;Israeli scientists say that women with persistent thyroid hormone imbalance during their pregnancy may be at an increased risk of having children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their new peer-reviewed study tracked thyroid levels in more than 51,000 pregnant women. The study found that children of women with long-lasting, untreated thyroid hormone imbalance during pregnancy had about two to three cases of autism per 100 children, compared with about one case per 100 in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Women who had a chronic thyroid condition that went untreated and got worse during pregnancy had a greater risk of having children with autism than pregnant women who were adequately treated,” Prof. Idan Menashe of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, the study’s lead author, said in a phone call.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;However, the scientists found that when a pregnant woman’s chronic thyroid dysfunction was “adequately treated,” there was no association with increased autism risk in her offspring, said Menashe, who is head of Ben-Gurion’s Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Community Health Sciences, and the scientific director of the Azrieli National Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben-Gurion researcher Leena Elbedour, May Weinberg of the Meir Medical Center and Tel Aviv University, Analya Michaelovski of Soroka University Medical Center, and Prof. Gal Meiri, also of Soroka University and Ben-Gurion University, collaborated on the study, which recently appeared in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/advance-article/doi/10.1210/clinem/dgaf596/8339900"&gt;The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp;amp; Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Israeli study: Untreated chronic thyroid condition in pregnancy ups autism risk in children"&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Thyroid hormones contribute to brain development.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland at the front of the neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thyroid hormones regulate the body’s metabolism, which is how the body uses and manages energy. These hormones also play a crucial role in essential processes such as heart rate regulation and the body’s muscle control.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3704008" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/idanMenashe-copy.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3704008" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/idanMenashe-copy-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

(Courtesy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thyroid hormones also support the production of myelin, an insulating, fatty coating around nerve fibers. These allow electrical signals to travel between the brain and body more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;During pregnancy, a woman’s thyroid hormone is essential for the neurodevelopment of the fetus. Studies have shown the association of a woman’s thyroid imbalance with atypical neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the thyroid produces the right amount of hormone, it is considered to be within the normal range, or balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a pregnant woman’s thyroid hormone levels are too low, doctors usually prescribe an artificial hormone that safely replaces the missing hormone.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children with autism may have delayed or absent speech, difficulties with social interaction, motor impairment, and repetitive behavior, with a spectrum of severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the world, autism spectrum disorder diagnoses have increased, including in Israel. A recent Israeli &lt;a href="https://www.bgu.ac.il/en/news-and-articles/dinstein-autism-prevalence/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found the number of ASD cases had quadrupled from 2017 to 2021 in two- and three-year-old children, and doubled in older ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thyroid imbalance during pregnancy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have studied the connection between a woman’s thyroid levels during pregnancy and her child’s development. However, most earlier studies checked the thyroid hormone once, usually early in pregnancy, and not throughout the pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;Menashe’s research, done at Soroka Medical Center, followed more than 51,000 births between January 2011 and December 2017 in a retrospective cohort study, with a follow-up through January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using blood-test data and the women’s medical records, the team divided the mothers into four groups: those with no thyroid problems, those with a chronic thyroid condition whose hormones were balanced in pregnancy, those with thyroid imbalance only during pregnancy, and those who had both a chronic thyroid condition and imbalance during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gave researchers the data to compare the women’s thyroid levels during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What surprised me is that only the last group, those who had both a chronic thyroid condition and were imbalanced during pregnancy, were at risk of having a child with autism,” Menashe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists also observed that the longer the duration of thyroid dysfunction across trimesters, the higher the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t really know the cause,” Menashe said. “But we know there is a link between them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked if he could calculate the specific percentage of risk, the scientist replied, “Not exactly, because this is not the exact way to assess risk. All we can say is that we see an increased risk, or more exactly, untreated thyroid problems are associated with an increased risk of autism.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3708009" class="wp-caption  alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/8597643e-4c7b-491e-a8ad-9de121448a75.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-vertical wp-image-3708009" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/8597643e-4c7b-491e-a8ad-9de121448a75-300x480.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dorit Shmueli, a specialist in neurology and child development and the Child Development Coordinator in Clalit Health Services, told The Times of Israel that research on the safety and importance of balancing hypothyroidism in pregnancy is “essential.”&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;“Optimal maternal thyroid function plays a key role in supporting healthy fetal brain development, and understanding how best to manage it can directly influence the developmental outcomes we see in children, especially autism spectrum disorder,” said Shmueli, who was not involved in the study. “Evidence-based insights from Prof. Idan Menashe’s research are crucial for informing clinical guidance and improving long-term well-being in the populations we serve.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe there is “some mechanism where the imbalance in the maternal thyroid hormone affects the neurodevelopment of the fetus,” Menashe said. “Eventually, this abnormal neurodevelopment is translated into autism in the child.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israeli Medical Association, following international guidelines, recommends that thyroid levels be monitored in pregnant women who are already being treated for thyroid imbalance. However, it does not recommend universal screening because treating mild thyroid problems has not been shown to clearly improve pregnancy or neurodevelopmental outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked whether there has been a change in the Health Ministry’s policy about routine thyroid screening, Menashe said, “I don’t think doctors change the protocols based on one study.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Health Ministry did not respond to a query about this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menashe said that more research is needed to “really study these mechanisms in animal models on a molecular level, and to specifically test these hypotheses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, he said, the findings “underscore the need for routine monitoring and timely adjustment of therapy to maintain normal thyroid hormone levels throughout pregnancy.”&lt;/p&gt;

This accomplishment reflects Brazil’s long-standing commitment to universal and free access to health services through its Unified Health System (SUS), anchored in a strong primary health-care system and respect for human rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV is a major public health achievement for any country, especially for a country as large and complex as Brazil,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Brazil has shown that with sustained political commitment and equitable access to quality health services, every country can ensure that every child is born free of HIV and every mother receives the care she deserves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The milestone was marked during a ceremony in Brasília, attended by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s Minister of Health&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Alexandre Padilha, and the Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Dr Jarbas Barbosa, along with representatives from  UNAIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Meeting validation criteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil met all the criteria for EMTCT validation, including reducing vertical transmission of HIV to below 2% and achieving over 95% coverage for prenatal care, routine HIV testing, and timely treatment for pregnant women living with HIV. In addition to meeting the targets of the validation, Brazil demonstrated the delivery of quality services for mothers and their infants, robust data and laboratory systems, and a strong commitment to human rights, gender equality and community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country implemented a progressive, subnational approach by first certifying states and municipalities with over 100 000 inhabitants, adapting the PAHO/WHO validation methodology to its national context while maintaining coherence across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evaluation, supported by PAHO, was conducted by independent experts who reviewed data, documentation, and health facility operations. Findings were then assessed by WHO’s Global Validation Advisory Committee, which formally recommended Brazil’s validation for elimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This achievement shows that eliminating vertical transmission of HIV is possible when pregnant women know their HIV status, receive timely treatment, and have access to maternal health services and safe delivery,” said Dr Jarbas Barbosa, Director of PAHO. “It is also the result of the tireless dedication of thousands of health professionals, community health workers, and civil society organizations. Every day, they sustain the continuity of care, identify obstacles, and work to overcome them, ensuring that even the most vulnerable populations can access essential health services."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Part of a broader initiative&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade (2015-2024), more than 50 000 pediatric HIV infections have been averted in the Region of the Americas as a result of the implementation of the initiative to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil’s success is part of the broader EMTCT Plus Initiative, which seeks to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, and congenital Chagas, in collaboration with UNICEF and UNAIDS. It is embedded within PAHO’s &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/elimination-initiative" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Elimination Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a regional effort to eliminate more than 30 communicable diseases and related conditions in the Americas by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am delighted that Brazil has just been certified by WHO/PAHO for eliminating vertical transmission – the first country of more than 100 million people to do so,” said Winnie Byanyima, UNAIDS Executive Director. “And they did it by doing what we know works –prioritizing universal health care, tackling the social determinants that drive the epidemic, protecting human rights, and even – when necessary – breaking monopolies to secure access to medicines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Global context&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil is one of 19 countries and territories worldwide that have been validated by WHO for EMTCT. Twelve of these are in the Region of the Americas. In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to be validated for EMTCT of HIV and the elimination of congenital syphilis. Other countries in the Region include Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and Saint Kitts and Nevis in 2017; Dominica in 2020; Belize in 2023; and Jamaica and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside the Americas, countries validated for EMTCT of HIV include Armenia, Belarus, Malaysia, Maldives, Oman, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a notice in the &lt;em&gt;Federal Register&lt;/em&gt; posted yesterday, the CDC is paying the University of Southern Denmark to conduct a single-blind clinical trial of the hepatitis B vaccine in newborns in Guinea-Bissau, a small country in West Africa with exceptionally high rates of maternal and infant mortality, where nearly one in five people &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31746078/#:~:text=Results:%20A%20total%20of%202715,enqu%C3%AAtes%20dans%20la%20population%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale."&gt;are infected with the hepatitis B virus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC is an agency within HHS. The study aims to assess the optimal timing and delivery of hepatitis B vaccinations, according to the notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘Appearance of blatant cronyism’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study was awarded without any competition from any other scientists, giving it “the appearance of blatant cronyism,” said Angela Rasmussen, PhD, a virologist and professor at the University of Saskatchewan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the federal announcement did not include the names of the researchers, the Danish university’s Bandim Health Project, which has conducted vaccine research in the developing African country for decades, &lt;a href="https://Although%20the%20federal%20announcement%20did%20not%20include%20the%20names%20of%20the%20researchers,%20the%20Danish%20university%E2%80%99s%20Bandim%20Health%20Project,%20which%20has%20conducted%20vaccine%20research%20in%20the%20developing%20African%20country%20for%20decades,%20has%20acknowledged%20being%20awarded%20the%20CDC%20grant."&gt;has acknowledged being awarded&lt;/a&gt; the CDC grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bandim project leaders &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/vaccines-have-health-effects-beyond-protecting-against-target-diseases-106383"&gt;have claimed to find “non-specific effects”&lt;/a&gt; from vaccines—some good and some bad—that they say &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10116894/pdf/40264_2023_Article_1295.pdf"&gt;should change how vaccine safety studies&lt;/a&gt; are conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their message has &lt;a href="https://www.weekendavisen.dk/samfund/et-daarligt-immunforsvar"&gt;resonated with Kennedy,&lt;/a&gt; a long-time anti-vaccine activist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/kennedy-pulls-us-support-gavis-vaccine-efforts"&gt;used a single study&lt;/a&gt; by the Bandim group &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/01/g-s1-74752/rfk-jr-vaccines-safety-gavi"&gt;to justify canceling&lt;/a&gt; more than $1 billion in funding for childhood vaccinations in developing countries. The observational study found an increased risk of death in children who received a combined vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DPT) that hasn’t been used in the United States in three decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists say people shouldn’t put too much faith in that study, which is an outlier and conflicts with hundreds of studies showing that vaccines are safe and save lives. Researchers and policy makers normally consider the totality of scientific evidence on vaccines, rather than a single study, which may be flawed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, observational studies, in which scientists merely follow patients but do not randomly assign them to undergo different medical interventions, are not able to prove cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization Kennedy founded, &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/research_category/dtap-tdap/#:~:text=Blok%20BA%2C%20de%20Bree%20LCJ%2C%20Diavatopoulos%20DA%2C,van%20Crevel%20R%2C%20Benn%20CS%2C%20Netea%20MG."&gt;cites the Danish group’s research&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/research_tags/diphtheria-tetanus-pertusis-dtp/"&gt;multiple pages&lt;/a&gt; of its website. One article &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/the-impact-of-vaccines-on-mortality-decline-since-1900-according-to-published-science/"&gt;praises the Bandim Health’s founder,&lt;/a&gt; Danish anthropologist Peter Aaby, casting him as a martyr who lost his funding when he suggested vaccines cause more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple scientists have criticized the Bandim group’s methodology and conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A review &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X25012344"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Vaccine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last month found that Bandim Health researchers “have systematically over-interpreted the findings from their randomized trials” for 25 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 23 out of 25 articles, the researchers highlighted secondary findings as support for their theories, but in 22 of these cases the evidence disappeared after proper statistical handling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group “systematically selected and highlighted results that supported their theories, while downplaying the fact that they did not confirm the primary hypothesis the trials were actually designed to test,” said Henrik Stovring, PhD, a professor of biomedicine at Denmark’s Aarhus University who led the new review, &lt;a href="https://health.au.dk/en/display/artikel/randomized-trials-show-no-evidence-of-non-specific-vaccine-effects"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In 23 out of 25 articles, the researchers highlighted secondary findings as support for their theories, but in 22 of these cases the evidence disappeared after proper statistical handling,” said Stovring said, who is &lt;span&gt;also a professor at the Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus&lt;/span&gt;. “When you look at the overall picture, there are almost no real findings left.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two reviews commissioned by the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i5434#:~:text=Taken%20together%2C%20the%20two%20systematic,countries%20is%20the%20only%20alternative."&gt;concluded that the evidence for non-specific effects&lt;/a&gt; “remains weak and vulnerable to biases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danish media also &lt;a href="https://www.weekendavisen.dk/samfund/et-daarligt-immunforsvar"&gt;have criticized&lt;/a&gt; Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn, MD, PhD, his wife and research partner, for &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/19/tracy-beth-hoeg-fda-advisor-marty-makary-vinay-prasad-vaccine-policy/#:~:text=Stabell%20Benn%20and%20her%20husband,results%20of%20the%20observational%20study."&gt;touting the findings of their observational study&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href="https://www.sensible-med.com/p/the-false-narrative-of-nonspecific"&gt;failing to publish the results&lt;/a&gt; of a randomized controlled trial—considered the gold standard of medical evidence—on the DPT vaccine, conducted 14 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By commissioning the new vaccine study, the Trump administration’s is trying “to do anything they can to discredit all vaccines,” said Peter Hotez, MD, PhD, endowed chair of tropical pediatrics at Texas Children’s Hospital and co-director of its Center for Vaccine Development. “This is so self-defeating for the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Danish researchers have influenced US vaccine policy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Aaby and Stabell Benn have found an audience in an influential federal advisory group whose members were handpicked by Kennedy, who fired all of the previous members. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the CDC, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/effects-hep-b-vax-summary-508.pdf"&gt;cited the Guinea-Bissau research multiple times&lt;/a&gt; in a presentation at its September meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stabell Benn has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/01-levi-covid-508.pdf"&gt;served as an expert source&lt;/a&gt; for ACIP and &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-the-next-four-years-can-improve-our-evidence-base/id1629371129?i=1000680049921"&gt;has collaborated&lt;/a&gt; on a Substack post and a series of podcasts with a senior leader at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Tracy Beth Hoeg, MD, PhD, who attends the committee’s meetings on behalf of agency. Hoeg previously &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/tracy-hoeg"&gt;worked as an adjunct associate&lt;/a&gt; professor at the University of Southern Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-left"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At an ACIP meeting this month, Hoeg &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-12-04-05/01-Hoeg-Danish-vax-schedule-508.pdf"&gt;presented slides&lt;/a&gt; about vaccination practices in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Denmark, suggesting that the United States follow that country’s approach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within hours, President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/12/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-begins-process-to-align-u-s-core-childhood-vaccine-recommendations-with-best-practices-from-peer-developed-countries/"&gt;called for the US to align&lt;/a&gt; its childhood vaccination schedule with those of countries such as Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Stabell Benn nor Aaby responded to a request for an interview by deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An HHS spokesman said the study in Guinea-Bissau will fill a vital need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This award supports an independent study designed to answer important questions about the broader health effects of the hepatitis B birth dose,” said Andrew Nixon. “This research aims to fill existing evidence gaps to help inform global hepatitis B vaccine policy and we will ensure the highest scientific and ethical standards are met.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of strenuous objections from three physicians on the committee, ACIP earlier this month &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/anti-science/cdc-advisers-drop-decades-old-universal-hepatitis-b-birth-dose-recommendation-suggest"&gt;voted to abandon&lt;/a&gt; a 34-year-old recommendation to vaccinate all newborns for hepatitis B, a practice that has reduced infections in children and adolescents by 99%. Since 1991, the universal HBV birth dose &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/vaccinating-newborns-against-hepatitis-b-saves-lives-why-might-cdc-panel-stop"&gt;has prevented an estimated&lt;/a&gt; 90,100 childhood deaths. Its safety &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/searchable-download/Universal%20Hepatitis%20B%20Vaccination%20at%20Birth%202Dec2025.pdf"&gt;has been demonstrated in hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of studies over the past four decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acting CDC director this week &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/hepatitis/cdc-accepts-acip-s-hepatitis-b-vaccine-recommendations-babies"&gt;followed ACIP advice&lt;/a&gt;, recommending a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine only for babies who mothers are infected with the virus or whose infection status is unknown. The change &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/cidrap-op-ed-heres-what-removal-hepatitis-b-birth-dose-will-look"&gt;will lead more babies to develop hepatitis B&lt;/a&gt;, which can lead to liver cancer, liver failure and death, wrote Jake Scott, MD, a clinical associate professor of infectious disease and geographic medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine, in an editorial for CIDRAP News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cherry-picking studies and researchers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple researchers who spoke to CIDRAP News questioned the need for another study of hepatitis B vaccines, which &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/searchable-download/Universal%20Hepatitis%20B%20Vaccination%20at%20Birth%202Dec2025.pdf"&gt;have been proven safe and effective&lt;/a&gt; in more than 400 studies over 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The data that supports the safety advocacy of the current hepatitis B vaccines is very robust,” said Amesh A. Adalja, MD, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the stance of the CDC under RFK Jr’s control, one can assume that the results of this study will be preordained to be against the hepatitis B vaccines,” Adalja said. “Continuing to do studies on a question that is already been answered sufficiently is a waste of resources that could better be used answering new questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers question where the Trump administration found $1.6 million for the study, given that it &lt;a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/mapping-federal-funding-cuts-to-us-colleges-and-universities/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Trump%20administration,claiming%20as%20victories%20thus%20far."&gt;has cut billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; in federal support for science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“NIH is in crisis, grants are being terminated, labs are closing, researchers are being laid off,” Scott told CIDRAP News. “But they found $1.6 million for an unsolicited proposal to study whether we should delay a vaccine we’ve been safely giving for 40 years, in a country where infants are at high risk of infection. The money exists. It’s the priorities that have changed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists said the new study raises ethical concerns on several fronts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awarding money to an organization without allowing other scientists to compete for the grant is very unusual, Rasmussen said. When this happens, the study protocol typically undergoes rigorous review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HHS has not released details of the study, noting only that the research will involve a “comparable study of the optimal timing and delivery of … hepatitis vaccinations on newborns in Guinea-Bissau. Activities will include conducting a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of neonatal hepatitis B vaccination on early-life mortality, morbidity, and long-term developmental outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen notes that it would not be ethical to provide a birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine to some babies but not others, given that doctors know the immunization saves lives, both in the early newborn period and decades later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposing thousands of babies to “a significant risk” of hepatitis B “in a low-income country with limited health care resources” would be “wildly unethical and a disgraceful use of American taxpayer money,” Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers note that Guinea-Bissau, &lt;a href="https://www.afdb.org/en/countries/west-africa/guinea-bissau/guinea-bissau-economic-outlook#:~:text=According%20to%20World%20Bank%20data,an%20estimated%203.9%25%20in%202023."&gt;has a poverty rate of 60%&lt;/a&gt; and a population of 2.2 million, about 150 times smaller than the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you commission research after making a decision, you're not looking for answers—you're looking for validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guinea-Bissau study’s findings are unlikely to be relevant to US vaccine policy, given the nation “has very different population demographics from the US and has a health system which is very different from the US,” said Robert H. Hopkins Jr., MD, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott said the study’s announcement suggests that the CDC isn’t truly looking for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In evidence-based policy, you gather data and then make a decision,” Scott said. “This is the reverse. CDC made the policy decision and then funded research to back it up. When you commission research after making a decision, you're not looking for answers—you're looking for validation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This story and headline were updated shortly after the story was published after the Bandim group confirmed that they are the recipients of the CDC funding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result: Only the F-word had any effect on pain outcomes. The team also measured the subjects’ pain threshold, asking them to indicate when the ice water began to feel painful. Those who chanted the F-word waited longer before indicating they felt pain—in other words, the swearing increased their threshold for pain. Chanting “fouch” or “twizpipe” had no effect on either measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;F@%*-ing go for it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this latest study, Stephens was interested in investigating potential mechanisms for swearing as a possible form of disinhibition (usually viewed negatively), building on his team’s &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-06780-014"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35135411/"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt; papers showing that swearing can improve strength in a chair push-up task. “In many situations, people hold themselves back—consciously or unconsciously—from using their full strength,” &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1110041?"&gt;said Stephens&lt;/a&gt;. “By swearing, we throw off social constraint and allow ourselves to push harder in different situations. Swearing is an easily available way to help yourself feel focused, confident and less distracted, and ‘go for it’ a little more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two separate experiments, participants were asked to select a swear word they’d normally use after, say, bumping their head, and a more neutral word to describe an inanimate object like a table. They then performed the aforementioned chair push-up task: sitting on a sturdy chair and placing their hands under their thighs with the fingers pointed inwards. Then they lifted their feet off the floor and straightened their arms to support their body weight for as long as possible, chanting either the swear word or the neutral word every two seconds. Afterward, subjects competed a questionnaire to assess various aspects of their mental state during the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results: Subjects who swore during the task could support their body weight much longer than those who merely repeated the neutral word. This confirms the reported results of similar studies in the past. Furthermore, subjects reported increases in their sense of psychological “flow,” distraction, and self-confidence, all indicators of increased disinhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings help explain why swearing is so commonplace,” &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1110041?"&gt;said Stephens&lt;/a&gt;. “Swearing is literally a calorie-neutral, drug-free, low-cost, readily available tool at our disposal for when we need a boost in performance.” The team next plans to explore the influence of swearing on public speaking and romantic behaviors, since these are situations where most people are more hesitant and less confident in themselves, and hence more likely to hold back.&lt;/p&gt;
