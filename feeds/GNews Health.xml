But there’s one surprising biological change that researchers are just starting to uncover, thanks to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022227525001270" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of Lipid Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Lipid Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, found that people with Alzheimer’s disease experience a breakdown in the ability to shuttle cholesterol to the neurons in their brain, and that this symptom is linked to a certain genetic variant called APOE4, which carries a known risk for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This biological discovery could potentially pave the way for a better understanding of the disease and even future disease prevention methods. Here’s what you need to know about the science so far, with input from a neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the expert&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil, DO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, is a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the researchers find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed the cerebrospinal fluid (the biological liquid that surrounds and cushions the brain and spinal cord) from 10 patients with Alzheimer’s disease and compared it to the cerebrospinal fluid of 10 people who did not have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that lipoproteins (round particles made of fat and protein) in the cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's patients were less effective at delivering cholesterol to neurons, or nerve cells, which are responsible for transmitting information from the brain throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is cholesterol? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol is an essential, waxy, fat-like molecule that your body needs for good health, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/blood-cholesterol" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Heart Lung and Blood Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Heart Lung and Blood Institute&lt;/a&gt; (NHLBI). Cholesterol is carried around your body by two types of lipoproteins: low-density lipoproteins (a.k.a. LDL or “bad” cholesterol) and high-density lipoproteins (a.k.a. HDL or “good” cholesterol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64894213/how-to-improve-cardiovasular-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LDL cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; can cause a buildup of fatty deposits called plaque in your arteries, raising the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other health complications, per the NHLBI. But high levels of good HDL cholesterol may lower the risk for certain health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it important for brain function?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it has a bad rap in the health world, cholesterol is actually really important for your proper brain function. Your brain is the most &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197018623001638" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197018623001638" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:-rich organ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;-rich organ&lt;/a&gt; in your body. Specifically, cholesterol helps make up cell membranes, including those in nerve cells, and plays a crucial role in your neurons' ability to "talk" to each other and transmit information. When cholesterol levels are out of balance, it can impact that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs12276-024-01273-4&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65821905%2Fcholesterol-alzheimers-link-apoe4-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:transmission of essential information;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;transmission of essential information&lt;/a&gt; between nerve cells, leading to cognitive issues that are seen with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Cholesterol is also a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/165/4/bqae032/7631422" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:building block;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;building block&lt;/a&gt; for steroid hormones, which support brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that doesn't mean more cholesterol is always good for your brain. High levels of LDL cholesterol are usually considered a modifiable risk factor for ischemic stroke, or “clogged pipes” in the brain, explains Clifford Segil, DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is less research and understanding on the possible benefits of cholesterol found in spinal fluid including HDL, which we classically identify as the ‘good cholesterol,’” Dr. Segil says. “We know high levels of certain types of cholesterol cause strokes and we are less clear in the year 2025 about the benefits of cholesterol in brain function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this link back to Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular study noted that cholesterol found in lipoproteins were different in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, but Dr. Segil says that there is a “complicated” relationship between lipids and protein in the brain. “Some researchers continue to assign memory loss symptoms in patients with Alzheimer’s due to abnormal brain protein levels and this paper noted lipid brain levels may also be abnormal,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Segil points out that neurologists commonly prescribe medications called statins to lower levels of cholesterol and the risk of stroke. Lowering levels of LDL cholesterol can decrease the risk of developing certain type of dementia, including vascular dementia, he says. But it’s not clear if it may do more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further research will determine if lowering your cholesterol will result in lower chances of getting Alzheimer’s dementia,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 12:22:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE9LODFjeHNWTUFTam9SWk10WWNyUTg3NmJzR3ZLVV94YW4xUU1lb2tCOXZtMEM3VVlUN3Z0ODNnU0JQOF9MNmJJV2lfbUxZb0haRE1nekh5TFhjc0w5ZnEtWWZzcVVPY1AtbWhiRUZNLWo</guid></item><item><title>可能对您的健康有害的5种食品添加剂—以及如何避免它们-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPWmlJaXFPWDUzT0FRd0V0Q0ROV1FYOWpkeWFRY0d0ODhpWWlHRWxoaTRPVnF4VS1TOU1fUHk5SzdFSTMzTlBrYmxFdkRRYkZQWS1VeUxzU2pqdHJCTWlaMkhHYUhIX3cwUWxCOEFkUkl4TVhtREFwVjk1alBmOXFfVUZqS1NGbHJhczlsZkdWR2I?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3GEMFEBYZBF3ZEPL6256K5Y7TI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A striking &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/07/ultra-processed-foods-cdc-data/" target="_blank"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from the federal government this month found that Americans on average get about half their calories from &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/01/07/healthier-ultra-processed-foods/" target="_blank"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; that have been linked in studies to increased rates of obesity and chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FCZ3YHUJ3NF3ZAAL5H6E6ICJCI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One reason ultra-processed foods might be so hazardous to your health is that they’re often loaded with chemical additives, such as synthetic emulsifiers, preservatives and sugar substitutes.

But according to OB-GYN, surgeon and co-host of the &lt;a href="https://www.shemdpodcast.com/" target="_blank"&gt;She MD podcast&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Thais Aliabadi, there are numerous other tests that women should also be receiving to better understand their health and prevent possibly life-threatening conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-39e61d" class="body-graf"&gt;The questions you should be asking at the doctor depend on your stage of life, Aliabadi explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dfd82c" class="body-graf"&gt;For example, if a teenage girl is struggling with painful or irregular periods, Aliabadi wants her to know that’s not normal and that she should be screened for endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). For women of reproductive age interested in knowing more about their fertility, it’s possible to find out your egg count. And if you’re approaching menopause and losing sleep, gaining weight or experiencing other changes, you should bring these up at your check-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-53d56f" class="body-graf"&gt;Unfortunately, many OB-GYNs don’t prioritize gathering as much information as they can about patients because they have limited time per patient, Aliabadi says. That’s why it’s important for women to be their own advocates when it comes to their symptoms and important health screenings, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc2606" class="body-graf"&gt;Here’s her checklist to take to your next well woman visit, depending on your stage of life. And many of these, if not all, will be covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-aaeac4" class="body-heading"&gt;Teens to 40s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-ee046f" class="body-heading"&gt;Screenings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-d743e1" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;General history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breast exam&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breast imaging (mammogram, ultrasound and MRI, depending on your risk)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pelvic exam and ultrasound&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pap smear and HPV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sexually transmitted infections&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Screening for underlying health conditions (PCOS, endometriosis, insulin resistance, thyroid dysfunction and autoimmune disorders)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mental health screenings for conditions including anxiety, depression and eating disorders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breast cancer risk assessment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetic testing if there is a family history of cancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Egg count test (AMH)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hormone panel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-ee37fe" class="body-heading"&gt;Conditions to Be Aware of&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44ff50" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PCOS: &lt;/strong&gt;Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition where the ovaries make higher-than-normal levels of androgens, or male-type hormones. This can interfere with ovulation and raise the risk of infertility, diabetes and heart disease. Common signs include irregular or missed periods, excess hair growth, acne and weight changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bedbdf" class="body-graf"&gt;There isn’t a single test for PCOS, and diagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms, blood tests to check hormone levels, and an ultrasound to look at the ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3037cb" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endometriosis: &lt;/strong&gt;Endometriosis affects 10% of women and is one of the top causes of infertility, according to Aliabadi. It is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside of it. Common signs include very painful periods, pain with sex, and bowel or bladder pain during menstruation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-02bd23" class="body-graf"&gt;Many women face years of delays before getting a diagnosis. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, a pelvic exam, imaging such as ultrasound or MRI, and sometimes laparoscopy, a minor surgery that allows doctors to look inside the pelvis directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8de81" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breast cancer: &lt;/strong&gt;Aliabadi wants every woman to know her lifetime risk of breast cancer by age 30, using tools like &lt;a href="https://www.shemdpodcast.com/risk-calculator" target="_blank"&gt;the Tyrer-Cuzick Risk Calculator&lt;/a&gt;. For most women, breast imaging should start at age 40, but if there’s a family history, start 10 years before your youngest affected relative’s diagnosis. Women at high risk — 20% or more in their lifetime — may need to begin screening as early as age 30, and women with genetic mutations may need to start as early as 25. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-24714b" class="body-graf"&gt;Genetic testing is especially important for women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, since results can guide when and how screening begins. Women with dense breasts or a high lifetime risk of breast cancer benefit from extra imaging such as ultrasound or MRI (in addition to mammograms). Aliabadi also recommends 3D mammography for women with dense breast tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4790e4" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccine-preventable illnesses: &lt;/strong&gt;Make sure you are up to date on important vaccines, such as HPV, COVID, Tdap, as well as the flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a79790" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perimenopause and Menopause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-75b75f" class="body-heading"&gt;Screenings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-8ac13f" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;General history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pelvic ultrasound&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mammogram and other indicated breast imaging (ultrasound or MRI)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hormone testing, especially if experiencing menopause symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colonoscopy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bone density test (DXA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart health: full lipid panel including APOB and lipoprotein (a), hs-CRP (inflammation marker), fasting glucose, HbA1c&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coronary calcium scan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dementia markers, such as Apoe4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Metabolic health markers, such as blood sugar, thyroid and vitamin levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetic testing, if there’s a new family history of cancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-2023f4" class="body-heading"&gt;Conditions to Be Aware of&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9f6b83" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perimenopause and menopause symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;These can include hair loss, hot flashes, sleep problems, vaginal dryness, painful sex, mood swings, brain fog and weight gain, especially in the abdomen. The good news is many of these are treatable, Aliabadi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d527ed" class="body-graf"&gt;If you experience any of these, you don’t need to “tough it out,” she adds. Bring them up with your doctor. Depending on your symptoms and health history, your doctor may order tests such as estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, FSH, LH, thyroid function, vitamin D, cholesterol and HbA1c. Based on results, treatment options may include hormone therapy, non-hormonal medications or local vaginal estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-86eb14" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccine-preventable illnesses: &lt;/strong&gt;Older women should be up to date on flu, Tdap, shingles, pneumonia and COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-d00b93" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dcf4c3" class="body-graf"&gt;Ultimately, Aliabadi wants women to know that they don’t need to muscle through uncomfortable symptoms, whether it’s painful periods as a teen or hot flashes later in life. And it’s important to be proactive about hormone health before perimenopause, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1562b0" class="body-graf"&gt;If you’re interested in having children, you should seek info about your fertility potential, and it’s key to start healthy habits before perimenopause to protect bone and heart health. These include eating a balanced diet of mostly whole foods and regular exercise, especially strength training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59812d" class="body-graf"&gt;“A woman’s exam should never be just a Pap smear, a pelvic exam, or a breast check.

   &lt;p&gt;CONDON, Mont. —&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Biologist &lt;a href="https://www.carroll.edu/about/directory/grant-hokit" target="_blank"&gt;Grant Hokit&lt;/a&gt; has come to this small meadow in the mountains outside Condon to look for ticks. A hiking path crosses the expanse of long grasses and berry bushes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As Hokit walks the path, he carries a handmade tool made out of plastic pipes taped together that hold a large rectangle of white flannel cloth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He jokes that this device is "sophisticated," but the scientific survey is quite serious: He's sweeping the cloth over the shrubs and grass, hoping that "questing" ticks will latch on.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Along the summer trail, ticks dangle from blades of grass, sticking their legs out and waiting for a passing mammal.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We got one," Hokit says. "So that came off of this sedge grass right here… simply pick them off with our fingers. We've got a vial that we pop them in."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Any captured ticks will go back to Hokit's lab in Helena for identification. Most of them will likely be identified as Rocky Mountain wood ticks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Hokit also wants to find out if new species are making their way into the state.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As human-driven climate change makes winters shorter, ticks are spending less time hibernating and have more active months when they can hitch rides on animals and people. Sometimes the ticks carry themselves — and &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-lyme-disease" target="_blank"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; — to new parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hokit found &lt;a href="https://www.mtpr.org/2025-05-27/briefs-grizzly-bear-deaths-meat-processing-funds-deer-ticks-detected" target="_blank"&gt;deer ticks for the first time&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year in northeastern Montana. Deer ticks are infamous for transmitting Lyme disease and can infect people with &lt;a href="https://www.ticklab.org/blog/2020/06/30/diseases-transmitted-by-blacklegged-deer-tick-bites/" target="_blank"&gt;other pathogens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-83651" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Hokit finds and identifies ticks alongside a trail outside Condon, Mont. These surveys help public health officials understand where ticks are in Montana and detect new species that have migrated on large mammals like deer. Hokit found deer ticks, which are known to carry Lyme disease, earlier this year in northeast Montana.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Knowing a new species like the deer tick has arrived in Montana or other states is important for doctors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr.&lt;a href="https://providers.billingsclinic.com/provider/tsun-sheng-n-ku/2068410" target="_blank"&gt; Neil Ku&lt;/a&gt; is an infectious disease specialist at Billings Clinic in eastern Montana. He says most patients don't come in right after they get bitten by a tick. They usually show up later, when they start feeling sick from a tick-borne illness.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Fever, some chills, they may just feel bad, similar to many infections we may encounter throughout the year," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's rare that patients connect a tick bite to those symptoms and even more rare that they capture and keep the tick that bit them. Sorting out whether someone might have a tick-borne illness can be complicated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Knowing what ticks are in the region will help doctors know that they might start encountering patients infected with new diseases after a tick bite, Ku says&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's partially why the state is on the hunt for new tick species.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The more we know about what's in Montana, the better we can inform our physicians, the better care you can receive," said &lt;a href="https://dphhs.mt.gov/publichealth/cdepi/contact" target="_blank"&gt;Devon Cozart&lt;/a&gt;, a zoonotic illness and vector-borne disease epidemiologist with the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cozart collects and tests the ticks from field surveys in Montana to see whether they are carrying any pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Whether a tick can get a human sick depends on the species, but the kind of mammal on which it feeds also plays a role.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Usually it's a rodent that might be carrying, for example, Rocky Mountain spotted fever. So, the tick will feed on that rodent, then will get the pathogen as well," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because the prevalence of a particular disease can vary in mammal populations, ticks in one part of the state could be more or less likely to get you sick. That's also important information for medical providers, says Cozart.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This kind of surveillance and testing isn't happening in every state or county. A 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.naccho.org/uploads/downloadable-resources/Vector-Assessment-2023-Sep.2024.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of nearly 500 health departments around the country found that roughly a quarter do some kind of tick surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Not all&lt;a href="https://www.naccho.org/uploads/downloadable-resources/Local_EH_Department_Tick_Activities_Final.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; surveillance efforts&lt;/a&gt; are equal, says &lt;a href="https://virtualcommunities.naccho.org/thrivecommunitiesofpractice/people/chelsea-gridley-smith" target="_blank"&gt;Chelsea Gridley-Smith&lt;/a&gt;, director of environmental health at the National Association of City and County Health Officials.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Field surveys can be expensive. For numerous local and state health departments, tick surveillance relies on a less expensive, more passive approach. Concerned patients, veterinarians and doctors must collect and send in ticks for identification.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It does provide a little information about what ticks are actually interacting with people and animals, but it doesn't get into the weeds of how common ticks are in that area and how often do those ticks carry pathogens," said Gridley-Smith.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says more health departments want to start tick surveillance, but getting funding is hard and might get harder as federal public health grants from agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dry up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Montana receives about $60,000 from a federal grant annually, but the bulk of that funding goes toward mosquito surveillance, which is more intensive and costly. What's left funds trips into the field to look for ticks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hokit says he doesn't have enough funding for his small team to survey everywhere he would like to in a state as large as Montana. That means he's unable to monitor emerging populations of deer ticks as closely as he would like.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He found those new deer ticks in two Montana counties, but he doesn't have enough data to determine whether they have begun reproducing there, establishing a local population.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Hokit uses data on climate and vegetation to make predictions about where deer ticks might thrive in the state. He has his eye on particular areas of western Montana, like the Flathead Valley.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says that will help his team narrow down where to look next so they can let the public know when deer ticks — and the disease they can carry — arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

            Dr. Jake Scott is on the front line of his second pandemic in five years and he is not getting much sleep.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ow000i2e6da8900uoo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott works full-time as an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care’s Tri-Valley hospital in Pleasanton, California. When he is done taking care of his patients and his two grade-school aged kids, he often stays up past midnight writing — furiously penning op-eds, collecting studies, leading evidence reviews and posting meaty threads on social media, most of them correcting the record on vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000j2e6dydyaeg8b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Often, he’s reacting to the latest maneuvers by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.. A &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356758355042607" target="_blank"&gt;pinned post&lt;/a&gt; responding to one of Kennedy’s appearances on Fox News has been viewed almost 5 million times. Another &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1951503868812206475" target="_blank"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; fact-checking Kennedy’s claims about potential harms from aluminum in vaccines had 1 million views in its first 48 hours. Scott’s followers on X have doubled since April.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000k2e6dzslngey5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A million views for this long-winded, very detailed, kind of nerdy breakdown of the science,” Scott said, marveling at the attention it got. “I think that’s saying something, you know? People want that information, and they deserve it,” said Scott who is 48.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000l2e6d2u9taka5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Covid-19 pandemic turned many infectious disease specialists and virologists into household names. Scott’s was not one of them, perhaps because he was too busy treating patients.  He didn’t stay out of the public discourse completely, however. He was one of the first doctors to tell people that Omicron didn’t seem to be as severe an infection as earlier strains of the virus, although&lt;a href="https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-952/" target="_blank"&gt; some virologists &lt;/a&gt;were skeptical at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik79s5002z2e6dler3ri5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In President Donald Trump’s second administration, however, Scott is taking on what he sees as a second pandemic —  misinformation and disinformation about vaccines. He knows false information can be as harmful as any virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000m2e6d9z5tugla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When officials spread inaccurate information about vaccines, it does have real consequences, and families make decisions based on fear rather than on facts,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmejcer27000k2e6esl5pahb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s already happening. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported data showing kindergarten vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;continue to decline&lt;/a&gt;, as states make it easier to opt out of school vaccination requirements. Vaccine preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/05/health/measles-cases-us-record-since-elimination"&gt;are rising again, too&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmejdnqwh000b3b6qlkh8czar@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott knows it could get much worse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000n2e6d5twv5ko7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In 2021, nearly every single patient I lost to Covid was unvaccinated by choice, and every colleague of mine has said the same thing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmeik3qfo002r2e6dm8nkudiy@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="a-pandemic-within-a-pandemic" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        A pandemic within a pandemic
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000p2e6d3qpwem4e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Scott, the fight to restore trust in vaccines is deeply personal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000q2e6duehy81qv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2020, he found himself in the crosshairs of Covid-19, treating a deluge of patients —many of them young and healthy — for a lethal new virus that was eating up their lungs, clotting their blood and causing catastrophic immune reactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;







    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000r2e6d8c2ugbaq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the beginning, they had nothing to stop it. No tests, no treatments, and certainly nothing to prevent it. He worked all day, every day during the week and every other weekend in full personal protective equipment. He says he lost dozens of patients in the span of a few months. He kept track of the numbers for a while, but then stopped counting when the deaths became so frequent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000s2e6dwjsk4kac@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We tried so hard,” Scott said in an interview with CNN. “Despite fighting for my patients with a hundred percent dedication, I lost so many people.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000t2e6dhxxjkjrx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then, in late December, 2020, it felt like a miracle happened — the Covid-19 vaccine. Operation Warp Speed had delivered what Trump had promised: a safe and highly effective vaccine in less than a year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000u2e6dszmf8u48@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I can’t emphasize enough how dramatic that change was once the vaccines became available,” Scott said. “I did see it firsthand, and it was mind-blowing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000v2e6din97i9nu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Within weeks, a Covid diagnosis was no longer a death sentence — at least, for the vaccinated. Even his most fragile patients, elderly people living in nursing homes, stopped dying. And then, as the vaccine became widely available, Scott’s crushing patient load lightened.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000w2e6d6hy7fcjw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But even as science was finally making inroads against Covid, a second problem arose, a phenomenon the World Health Organization identified as &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;an infodemic&lt;/a&gt;—the flood of information, much of it false, that occurs during a disease outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000x2e6dqp561bpl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We had these two parallel pandemics. We had the Covid pandemic, and then the pandemic of, you know, the infodemic misinformation,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000y2e6d4tu36khx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While Covid is no longer a public health emergency, Scott said, the country never effectively dealt with the disinformation pandemic, and we’re paying for it now.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000z2e6d5argtrtx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He believes misinformation, more than almost anything else, explains our current political moment, and “it’s only getting worse,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00102e6dmnei2re0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve seen what happens when people avoid vaccines because of misinformation, and it’s absolutely heartbreaking,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00112e6drq3jpsfk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott has made it his mission to take on misstatements and distortions about vaccines, especially when they come from &lt;a href="https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime anti-vaccine activist who Trump installed as his Secretary of Health and Human Services earlier this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00122e6dh5g33y7m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He is doing it at a time when many others are afraid to speak up for fear of making themselves or their institutions targets of the Trump administration’s lawsuits and funding cuts, and when anti-vaccine rhetoric and demonization of scientists has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/12/us/cdc-atlanta-shooting-shots-windows"&gt;inspired violence&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00132e6dfgjh8nkt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m not afraid,” Scott said.  “Stanford stands behind me.  I have amazing support.”
    &lt;/p&gt;





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeixuj7q00003b6qnc7qhi0u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy has maintained that he is not anti-vaccine and that he is a proponent of vaccine safety. But Kennedy’s HHS has already made &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/health/video/rfk-jr-vaccines-overhaul-digvid"&gt;sweeping changes&lt;/a&gt; to US vaccine infrastructure and policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00142e6d217tgma6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott says he has not heard directly from Kennedy, but he does get comments from his supporters. Some have called Scott “brainwashed” and a “pharma shill” or accused him of being “a fake doctor.” (The University of Vermont confirmed Scott graduated from medical school there in 2011, and he has an active medical license in California.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00162e6dse1e7s9a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott said he gets a salary from Stanford to treat patients and teach, but he’s mostly working to correct the record on vaccines on his own dime. The government’s Open Payments database — where drug companies have to report payments to physicians — shows Scott received a single payment between 2018 and 2024, a $13 payment reported by the drug company Janssen in 2022. Scott thinks he must have eaten a group lunch somewhere and didn’t realize it was sponsored.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00172e6df27lxrpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott’s writing and advocacy recently caught the attention of Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Osterholm tapped him to be a senior reviewer of evidence for the Covid, flu and RSV vaccines for the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/health/covid-vaccine-recommendation-aap"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a group of outside public health experts that has been independently reviewing data on vaccines out of concern for vaccine misinformation and access under current federal health leadership.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmej5mc1600083b6qvodwtvml@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott cancelled a planned vacation to jump in to help and was among the scientists who presented the group’s findings &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSuvGlxqrpg" target="_blank"&gt;live on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00182e6dx38cb7iq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He has an uncanny way of taking complicated issues and distilling them down into readable, understandable pieces of information,” Osterholm said.  “He has what I consider to be almost limitless energy.  He’s really a very hard worker.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00192e6d63tanomj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He is a real professional star,” Osterholm said, “But personally, he’s just, he’s a very kind and thoughtful individual.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001b2e6d2jrhbn2g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I work with a number of colleagues, even now, who never had a job until they became doctors,” Scott said, “And you can kind of tell. They’re still great doctors, but it’s just a different perspective.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001c2e6d6gttf02h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott got his first paying job at age 11, an off-the-books gig at A Bicycle Odyssey, a bike shop in Sausalito, California, frequented by the likes of Robin Williams, members of the band The Grateful Dead and Huey Lewis. He said the owner paid him $2.50 an hour to organize bike shoes. Eventually, he graduated to lacing the spokes on bike wheels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001d2e6dq0x31mu1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott said he didn’t save much because he poured all his earnings back into the shop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001e2e6dlxyonz5f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Becoming a doctor was never something he imagined he could do.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001f2e6dgnuh8j5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His parents were hippies, Scott said. They bought a fishing shack in Sausalito, one of the few properties that had its own beach, and over years of living there turned it into a two-story house.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001g2e6dle69a5oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott’s parents were well-known and liked in Sausalito. They started a July 4 parade in town. His father was on the local school board and often walked around town with a parrot on his shoulder. He owned a business that distributed the print edition of The New York Times around the San Francisco Bay area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001j2e6d3zwft4f1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Both our kids have worked all their lives. They had no choice,” said Scott’s father, Marvin.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001h2e6dvei6l3t0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After Scott’s stint at the bike shop, he went to work at a surf shack at age 14, a hobby that became another passion. For college, he followed his older sister to the University of California at Santa Cruz because there was good surfing near the campus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001i2e6dttomh1bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the first two years, he said he dabbled in different interests, including environmental studies. Realizing he didn’t know what he wanted to do with his life, and not wanting to waste money on tuition, he took a year off from school and worked roofing and construction jobs.  For a while, he said, he lived in the woods behind the campus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001k2e6dn5ln1flk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The hard, physical labor of construction convinced him to return to school.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001l2e6dm5k4kud6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I wanted to use my brain, not my back,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001m2e6dm8pz7a0k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He began writing poems and short stories and applied to the literature program. He got in and graduated with a writing degree.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001n2e6d3l4n18n6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After gradulation he worked odd jobs and traveled.  He taught English in Japan, but nothing seemed to stick or turn into a career.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001o2e6dyyza91uh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When he came back to the US, a friend recruited him to work at Planned Parenthood. He worked as a medical assistant — talking to patients, often guiding them through the most difficult times in their lives — and became an HIV testing counselor. He discovered he had a talent for it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001p2e6d0q4qcepb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of clients were surprised when they when they found that their medical assistant was a man,” Scott said.  “But I think that that really taught me to try to sort of be disarming and not judgmental and not intimidating, and to be empathetic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001q2e6dy8lei7ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He volunteered at San Francisco General Hospital and worked in the Tenderloin, a part of the city that’s had a reputation for drug use, crime, and homelessness, helping with needle exchange programs for people with substance use disorders.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001r2e6dvfd9u7es@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He fell in love with medicine,” Marvin Scott said of his son.
    &lt;/p&gt;





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001s2e6d8jfmgxut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The experience at Planned Parenthood made him think about becoming a doctor, even though it was never a dream he’d had for himself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001t2e6dgtfmqwxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was a pretty gutsy thing to do at that stage in his life,” said Scott’s dad, Marvin. His parents gave their blessing — as long as he paid for it himself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001u2e6dbb1uhfli@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There was just one problem: Scott hadn’t taken any pre-med classes in college. The only biology class he took in college was an intro to marine biology called “Life Under the Sea.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001v2e6diulscr76@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He enrolled in a two-year program at Mills College, traditionally a women’s college, for graduates who wanted to go to medical school.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001w2e6dcyyu4tgf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I worked so hard,” Scott said. The school’s library closed at midnight, and Scott says he was usually there when they were locking up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001x2e6d4w3t7t7z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I had sort-of avoided science and math growing up.  I was just this free-spirited kid and young adult,” Scott said.  “I didn’t know whether I had what it takes to be a doctor.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001y2e6dlibxsynh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As he was completing his studies at Mills, he ran the gauntlet of med school admissions, applying to dozens of schools and flying around the country for interviews. He was accepted to the University of Vermont and started medical school at age 30.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001z2e6dmmbhja5i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think my sort of secret weapon is that I have a lot of self-discipline. And I don’t think of myself as the smartest by any means, but I do have a pretty, pretty insane work ethic,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00202e6doligfsff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After two years of learning anatomy and taking classes exams in medical school, Scott spent two years shadowing country doctors in Maine and Vermont, sometimes making house calls to see patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00212e6duj07t7d8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of them, a doctor known to be a tough evaluator, later wrote Scott a recommendation saying that not only was he well-informed and great with patients, but “He’s got soul.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00222e6dk15165po@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That just meant so much to me,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00242e6dvotsq1dr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a medical resident — essentially a junior doctor — at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Oakland, Scott got to try out different specialties.  One of his first rotations was infectious disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00252e6d7vqimjqd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His first patient — a wealthy, older White man — was gravely ill in the intensive care unit. His case had stumped his doctors.  He was anemic, with high fevers and a high heart rate.  He had all the symptoms of malaria, but none of the risk factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00262e6d3768ufl2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The infectious disease team was called in to consult on the case. The doctor who was training Scott thought of a disease that mimics malaria, called &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/17/health/babesiosis-tick-disease-northeast"&gt;Babesiosis&lt;/a&gt;. It’s caused by a parasite that infects red blood cells through the bite of a tick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00272e6d8457g133@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the ticks in California, where the man lived, don’t commonly carry Babesia. The infection was more widespread in New England.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00282e6dto0vv08j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The doctor asked the man’s wife if they had been there recently.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00292e6d8402p61r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sure enough, a week before he came in, they had spent the summer on Long Island,” Scott said. They checked the patient’s blood under a microscope. The cells were teeming with parasites.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002a2e6dwfwqxnoj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She made the diagnosis by asking this one question,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002b2e6dwiukqpk5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Infectious disease seemed like the perfect combination of Scott’s academic interests —medicine and storytelling. If you could understand a patient’s story, oftentimes, you could make a diagnosis. Scott was hooked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002c2e6d54421q0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He got his dream job at Stanford, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/united-states/infectious-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;best infectious disease programs&lt;/a&gt; in the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002d2e6dj5pqvwj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then it was 2020, and his dream job became a nightmare.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002e2e6d3ys6vhyq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just can’t emphasize enough how devastating 2020 was,” Scott said. He watched people die of a virus, then watched others die because they couldn’t separate facts from fiction and were too scared to get a vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002f2e6dsk6jh6tt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He remembers treating a family of three, all unvaccinated, and all three got severe Covid. None had any significant underlying medical conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeje0o4x000d3b6qpuan2x31@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The father told Scott that he’d rather be shot in the head than get the Covid-19 vaccine. The mother didn’t survive her infection. When the son woke up in the ICU, he learned she had died.

            “It was one of the worst things I’ve ever experienced,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002i2e6d3zhed2sq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I saw her as a victim of inaccurate information,” Scott said. “I remember seeing family members crying outside of the hospital, and they were holding bags with her belongings, and it absolutely broke my heart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002j2e6dczq7ix1f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So he’s staying up at nights working late, hoping to save others from the same fate:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002k2e6d3np7gx6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No, children don’t get 92 shots by the time they’re 18, &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356762306130021" target="_blank"&gt;he explained recently on X&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you count annual flu shots, it’s about 48 to 51.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002l2e6drox9l1r2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yes, we do know the safety profiles of vaccines, &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356765992943997" target="_blank"&gt;he shared in another post&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmej56yei00053b6qacfn79aa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No, the people who made recommendations about vaccines to the CDC — before they were dismissed by Kennedy — don’t have rampant conflicts of interest, &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356760557027684" target="_blank"&gt;he detailed in another post&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In that way, he hopes to inoculate people against disinformation, one fact at a time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Dr. Jake Scott is on the front line of his second pandemic in five years and he is not getting much sleep.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ow000i2e6da8900uoo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott works full-time as an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care’s Tri-Valley hospital in Pleasanton, California. When he is done taking care of his patients and his two grade-school aged kids, he often stays up past midnight writing — furiously penning op-eds, collecting studies, leading evidence reviews and posting meaty threads on social media, most of them correcting the record on vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000j2e6dydyaeg8b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Often, he’s reacting to the latest maneuvers by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.. A &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356758355042607" target="_blank"&gt;pinned post&lt;/a&gt; responding to one of Kennedy’s appearances on Fox News has been viewed almost 5 million times. Another &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1951503868812206475" target="_blank"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; fact-checking Kennedy’s claims about potential harms from aluminum in vaccines had 1 million views in its first 48 hours. Scott’s followers on X have doubled since April.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000k2e6dzslngey5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A million views for this long-winded, very detailed, kind of nerdy breakdown of the science,” Scott said, marveling at the attention it got. “I think that’s saying something, you know? People want that information, and they deserve it,” said Scott who is 48.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000l2e6d2u9taka5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Covid-19 pandemic turned many infectious disease specialists and virologists into household names. Scott’s was not one of them, perhaps because he was too busy treating patients.  He didn’t stay out of the public discourse completely, however. He was one of the first doctors to tell people that Omicron didn’t seem to be as severe an infection as earlier strains of the virus, although&lt;a href="https://www.microbe.tv/twiv/twiv-952/" target="_blank"&gt; some virologists &lt;/a&gt;were skeptical at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik79s5002z2e6dler3ri5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In President Donald Trump’s second administration, however, Scott is taking on what he sees as a second pandemic —  misinformation and disinformation about vaccines. He knows false information can be as harmful as any virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000m2e6d9z5tugla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When officials spread inaccurate information about vaccines, it does have real consequences, and families make decisions based on fear rather than on facts,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmejcer27000k2e6esl5pahb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s already happening. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported data showing kindergarten vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;continue to decline&lt;/a&gt;, as states make it easier to opt out of school vaccination requirements. Vaccine preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/05/health/measles-cases-us-record-since-elimination"&gt;are rising again, too&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmejdnqwh000b3b6qlkh8czar@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott knows it could get much worse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000n2e6d5twv5ko7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In 2021, nearly every single patient I lost to Covid was unvaccinated by choice, and every colleague of mine has said the same thing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmeik3qfo002r2e6dm8nkudiy@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="a-pandemic-within-a-pandemic" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        A pandemic within a pandemic
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000p2e6d3qpwem4e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Scott, the fight to restore trust in vaccines is deeply personal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000q2e6duehy81qv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2020, he found himself in the crosshairs of Covid-19, treating a deluge of patients —many of them young and healthy — for a lethal new virus that was eating up their lungs, clotting their blood and causing catastrophic immune reactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;







    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000r2e6d8c2ugbaq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the beginning, they had nothing to stop it. No tests, no treatments, and certainly nothing to prevent it. He worked all day, every day during the week and every other weekend in full personal protective equipment. He says he lost dozens of patients in the span of a few months. He kept track of the numbers for a while, but then stopped counting when the deaths became so frequent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000s2e6dwjsk4kac@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We tried so hard,” Scott said in an interview with CNN. “Despite fighting for my patients with a hundred percent dedication, I lost so many people.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000t2e6dhxxjkjrx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then, in late December, 2020, it felt like a miracle happened — the Covid-19 vaccine. Operation Warp Speed had delivered what Trump had promised: a safe and highly effective vaccine in less than a year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000u2e6dszmf8u48@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I can’t emphasize enough how dramatic that change was once the vaccines became available,” Scott said. “I did see it firsthand, and it was mind-blowing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000v2e6din97i9nu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Within weeks, a Covid diagnosis was no longer a death sentence — at least, for the vaccinated. Even his most fragile patients, elderly people living in nursing homes, stopped dying. And then, as the vaccine became widely available, Scott’s crushing patient load lightened.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000w2e6d6hy7fcjw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But even as science was finally making inroads against Covid, a second problem arose, a phenomenon the World Health Organization identified as &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;an infodemic&lt;/a&gt;—the flood of information, much of it false, that occurs during a disease outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000x2e6dqp561bpl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We had these two parallel pandemics. We had the Covid pandemic, and then the pandemic of, you know, the infodemic misinformation,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000y2e6d4tu36khx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While Covid is no longer a public health emergency, Scott said, the country never effectively dealt with the disinformation pandemic, and we’re paying for it now.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox000z2e6d5argtrtx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He believes misinformation, more than almost anything else, explains our current political moment, and “it’s only getting worse,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00102e6dmnei2re0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve seen what happens when people avoid vaccines because of misinformation, and it’s absolutely heartbreaking,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00112e6drq3jpsfk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott has made it his mission to take on misstatements and distortions about vaccines, especially when they come from &lt;a href="https://counterhate.com/research/the-disinformation-dozen/" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime anti-vaccine activist who Trump installed as his Secretary of Health and Human Services earlier this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00122e6dh5g33y7m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He is doing it at a time when many others are afraid to speak up for fear of making themselves or their institutions targets of the Trump administration’s lawsuits and funding cuts, and when anti-vaccine rhetoric and demonization of scientists has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/12/us/cdc-atlanta-shooting-shots-windows"&gt;inspired violence&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00132e6dfgjh8nkt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m not afraid,” Scott said.  “Stanford stands behind me.  I have amazing support.”
    &lt;/p&gt;





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeixuj7q00003b6qnc7qhi0u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy has maintained that he is not anti-vaccine and that he is a proponent of vaccine safety. But Kennedy’s HHS has already made &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/health/video/rfk-jr-vaccines-overhaul-digvid"&gt;sweeping changes&lt;/a&gt; to US vaccine infrastructure and policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00142e6d217tgma6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott says he has not heard directly from Kennedy, but he does get comments from his supporters. Some have called Scott “brainwashed” and a “pharma shill” or accused him of being “a fake doctor.” (The University of Vermont confirmed Scott graduated from medical school there in 2011, and he has an active medical license in California.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00162e6dse1e7s9a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott said he gets a salary from Stanford to treat patients and teach, but he’s mostly working to correct the record on vaccines on his own dime. The government’s Open Payments database — where drug companies have to report payments to physicians — shows Scott received a single payment between 2018 and 2024, a $13 payment reported by the drug company Janssen in 2022. Scott thinks he must have eaten a group lunch somewhere and didn’t realize it was sponsored.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00172e6df27lxrpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott’s writing and advocacy recently caught the attention of Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Osterholm tapped him to be a senior reviewer of evidence for the Covid, flu and RSV vaccines for the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/health/covid-vaccine-recommendation-aap"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a group of outside public health experts that has been independently reviewing data on vaccines out of concern for vaccine misinformation and access under current federal health leadership.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmej5mc1600083b6qvodwtvml@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott cancelled a planned vacation to jump in to help and was among the scientists who presented the group’s findings &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSuvGlxqrpg" target="_blank"&gt;live on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00182e6dx38cb7iq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He has an uncanny way of taking complicated issues and distilling them down into readable, understandable pieces of information,” Osterholm said.  “He has what I consider to be almost limitless energy.  He’s really a very hard worker.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00192e6d63tanomj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He is a real professional star,” Osterholm said, “But personally, he’s just, he’s a very kind and thoughtful individual.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001b2e6d2jrhbn2g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I work with a number of colleagues, even now, who never had a job until they became doctors,” Scott said, “And you can kind of tell. They’re still great doctors, but it’s just a different perspective.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001c2e6d6gttf02h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott got his first paying job at age 11, an off-the-books gig at A Bicycle Odyssey, a bike shop in Sausalito, California, frequented by the likes of Robin Williams, members of the band The Grateful Dead and Huey Lewis. He said the owner paid him $2.50 an hour to organize bike shoes. Eventually, he graduated to lacing the spokes on bike wheels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001d2e6dq0x31mu1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott said he didn’t save much because he poured all his earnings back into the shop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001e2e6dlxyonz5f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Becoming a doctor was never something he imagined he could do.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001f2e6dgnuh8j5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His parents were hippies, Scott said. They bought a fishing shack in Sausalito, one of the few properties that had its own beach, and over years of living there turned it into a two-story house.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001g2e6dle69a5oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott’s parents were well-known and liked in Sausalito. They started a July 4 parade in town. His father was on the local school board and often walked around town with a parrot on his shoulder. He owned a business that distributed the print edition of The New York Times around the San Francisco Bay area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001j2e6d3zwft4f1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Both our kids have worked all their lives. They had no choice,” said Scott’s father, Marvin.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001h2e6dvei6l3t0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After Scott’s stint at the bike shop, he went to work at a surf shack at age 14, a hobby that became another passion. For college, he followed his older sister to the University of California at Santa Cruz because there was good surfing near the campus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001i2e6dttomh1bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the first two years, he said he dabbled in different interests, including environmental studies. Realizing he didn’t know what he wanted to do with his life, and not wanting to waste money on tuition, he took a year off from school and worked roofing and construction jobs.  For a while, he said, he lived in the woods behind the campus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001k2e6dn5ln1flk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The hard, physical labor of construction convinced him to return to school.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001l2e6dm5k4kud6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I wanted to use my brain, not my back,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001m2e6dm8pz7a0k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He began writing poems and short stories and applied to the literature program. He got in and graduated with a writing degree.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001n2e6d3l4n18n6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After gradulation he worked odd jobs and traveled.  He taught English in Japan, but nothing seemed to stick or turn into a career.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001o2e6dyyza91uh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When he came back to the US, a friend recruited him to work at Planned Parenthood. He worked as a medical assistant — talking to patients, often guiding them through the most difficult times in their lives — and became an HIV testing counselor. He discovered he had a talent for it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001p2e6d0q4qcepb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of clients were surprised when they when they found that their medical assistant was a man,” Scott said.  “But I think that that really taught me to try to sort of be disarming and not judgmental and not intimidating, and to be empathetic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001q2e6dy8lei7ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He volunteered at San Francisco General Hospital and worked in the Tenderloin, a part of the city that’s had a reputation for drug use, crime, and homelessness, helping with needle exchange programs for people with substance use disorders.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001r2e6dvfd9u7es@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He fell in love with medicine,” Marvin Scott said of his son.
    &lt;/p&gt;





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001s2e6d8jfmgxut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The experience at Planned Parenthood made him think about becoming a doctor, even though it was never a dream he’d had for himself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001t2e6dgtfmqwxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was a pretty gutsy thing to do at that stage in his life,” said Scott’s dad, Marvin. His parents gave their blessing — as long as he paid for it himself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001u2e6dbb1uhfli@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There was just one problem: Scott hadn’t taken any pre-med classes in college. The only biology class he took in college was an intro to marine biology called “Life Under the Sea.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001v2e6diulscr76@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He enrolled in a two-year program at Mills College, traditionally a women’s college, for graduates who wanted to go to medical school.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001w2e6dcyyu4tgf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I worked so hard,” Scott said. The school’s library closed at midnight, and Scott says he was usually there when they were locking up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001x2e6d4w3t7t7z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I had sort-of avoided science and math growing up.  I was just this free-spirited kid and young adult,” Scott said.  “I didn’t know whether I had what it takes to be a doctor.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001y2e6dlibxsynh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As he was completing his studies at Mills, he ran the gauntlet of med school admissions, applying to dozens of schools and flying around the country for interviews. He was accepted to the University of Vermont and started medical school at age 30.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox001z2e6dmmbhja5i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think my sort of secret weapon is that I have a lot of self-discipline. And I don’t think of myself as the smartest by any means, but I do have a pretty, pretty insane work ethic,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00202e6doligfsff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After two years of learning anatomy and taking classes exams in medical school, Scott spent two years shadowing country doctors in Maine and Vermont, sometimes making house calls to see patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00212e6duj07t7d8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of them, a doctor known to be a tough evaluator, later wrote Scott a recommendation saying that not only was he well-informed and great with patients, but “He’s got soul.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “That just meant so much to me,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00242e6dvotsq1dr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a medical resident — essentially a junior doctor — at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Oakland, Scott got to try out different specialties.  One of his first rotations was infectious disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00252e6d7vqimjqd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His first patient — a wealthy, older White man — was gravely ill in the intensive care unit. His case had stumped his doctors.  He was anemic, with high fevers and a high heart rate.  He had all the symptoms of malaria, but none of the risk factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00262e6d3768ufl2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The infectious disease team was called in to consult on the case. The doctor who was training Scott thought of a disease that mimics malaria, called &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/17/health/babesiosis-tick-disease-northeast"&gt;Babesiosis&lt;/a&gt;. It’s caused by a parasite that infects red blood cells through the bite of a tick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00272e6d8457g133@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the ticks in California, where the man lived, don’t commonly carry Babesia. The infection was more widespread in New England.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00282e6dto0vv08j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The doctor asked the man’s wife if they had been there recently.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox00292e6d8402p61r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sure enough, a week before he came in, they had spent the summer on Long Island,” Scott said. They checked the patient’s blood under a microscope. The cells were teeming with parasites.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002a2e6dwfwqxnoj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She made the diagnosis by asking this one question,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002b2e6dwiukqpk5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Infectious disease seemed like the perfect combination of Scott’s academic interests —medicine and storytelling. If you could understand a patient’s story, oftentimes, you could make a diagnosis. Scott was hooked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002c2e6d54421q0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He got his dream job at Stanford, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/united-states/infectious-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;best infectious disease programs&lt;/a&gt; in the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002d2e6dj5pqvwj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then it was 2020, and his dream job became a nightmare.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002e2e6d3ys6vhyq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just can’t emphasize enough how devastating 2020 was,” Scott said. He watched people die of a virus, then watched others die because they couldn’t separate facts from fiction and were too scared to get a vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002f2e6dsk6jh6tt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He remembers treating a family of three, all unvaccinated, and all three got severe Covid. None had any significant underlying medical conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeje0o4x000d3b6qpuan2x31@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The father told Scott that he’d rather be shot in the head than get the Covid-19 vaccine. The mother didn’t survive her infection. When the son woke up in the ICU, he learned she had died.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002h2e6docpmca6o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was one of the worst things I’ve ever experienced,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002i2e6d3zhed2sq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I saw her as a victim of inaccurate information,” Scott said. “I remember seeing family members crying outside of the hospital, and they were holding bags with her belongings, and it absolutely broke my heart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002j2e6dczq7ix1f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So he’s staying up at nights working late, hoping to save others from the same fate:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002k2e6d3np7gx6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No, children don’t get 92 shots by the time they’re 18, &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356762306130021" target="_blank"&gt;he explained recently on X&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you count annual flu shots, it’s about 48 to 51.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002l2e6drox9l1r2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yes, we do know the safety profiles of vaccines, &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356765992943997" target="_blank"&gt;he shared in another post&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            No, the people who made recommendations about vaccines to the CDC — before they were dismissed by Kennedy — don’t have rampant conflicts of interest, &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1933356760557027684" target="_blank"&gt;he detailed in another post&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeik31ox002o2e6dvtm3juow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In that way, he hopes to inoculate people against disinformation, one fact at a time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

you're likely to experience with Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But for women who claim to be experiencing 'Ozempic vulva', these sound like a walk in the park in comparison &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-side-effects-women-vulva-news-828013-20250819"&gt;to what they're dealing with&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Numerous females who have been using the GLP-1 medications for weight loss purposes have complained that this side effect has now started to cause them aggravation on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Although Ozempic vulva isn't an official medical term and is not a recognised side effect by manufacturers Novo Nordisk, a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/us-news"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;-based physician explained that loads of women have been complaining of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Michael Tahery &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.drtahery.com/ozempic-vagina-what-are-the-side-effects-of-semaglutide"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; that weight loss drugs can impact the vulva and vagina in three ways - causing sagging of the outer labia, weakness of the vaginal muscles, and vaginal dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As those consuming weight loss drugs often shed the pounds rapidly, this can cause their skin to sag...and unfortunately ladies, the vulva is not immune to this either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"It may result in visible sagging of the labia or vagina because of overall fat and volume loss," Dr Tahery said. "This sagging is caused by loose labia loose skin in the vaginal area, wrinkles, or some combination of all three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"It’s also common for rapid weight loss to cause the labia to suddenly feel out of proportion compared to how it previously felt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The latter part of that sentence has hit the nail on the head for a number of ladies who have been complaining about Ozempic vulva and everything that comes with it on &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/reddit"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;One woman shared a post explaining that she wanted to know if she was the only one who was left feeling seriously out of sorts by the change in appearance of their private parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I have lost 30% of my starting weight and obviously have had a significant change in body shape,' she said. "One of the weirder side effects is that I am far more aware of my labia now, not in a sexual way, but just in a being aware of a body part I was not previously very aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;'Ozempic vulva' has been causing chaos for some ladies (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I am not a prudish person by nature, but it is sometimes to the point where I feel uncomfortable about it. I wonder if it's to do with the size of my upper thighs, actually - that there used to be a lot more cushion and now there is a gap? Anyway, it's weird and probably the thing I least expected to occur."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This ended up sparking quite the mother's meeting about how their protruding labia's were seriously getting in the way, how people are struggling to adapt to it and &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-side-effects-females-vulva-women-097174-20250818"&gt;how it can impact your sex life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;One person said: "Yep.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="34" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme8p48y0003ykvktg78px6rx@published"&gt;About 3 million Americans die every year. Compared with other rich countries, we die at an alarmingly higher rate: One-quarter of those deaths wouldn’t have occurred if America were only as deadly as its peers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0cpo000k3b79ro42jerr@published"&gt;Zoom in, and things get even more concerning: Among Americans younger than 65, almost half of deaths wouldn’t happen if we had a death rate that matched our peers. Among those aged 25 to 44, a group we call “early adults,” it’s 62 percent—nearly two out of three deaths at those early ages.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0csc000l3b79u93k4zdb@published"&gt;We’re mortality experts, and these facts stem from &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.1118"&gt;an analysis we did&lt;/a&gt; of death rates in 22 countries from 1980 through 2023 (the last year with reliable data). When we set out to do this research, we expected to find a story about the COVID-19 pandemic. America’s pandemic experience was much worse than that of our peers, with three U.S. deaths for every two in peer countries. Nonelderly Americans in particular were hit harder than nonelderly populations in other rich countries. This disadvantage only grew as vaccinations became available but were adopted by Americans at lower rates.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0cuu000m3b79jg7i4jwq@published"&gt;But what surprised us was that, from today’s postpandemic vantage point, the American health disadvantage &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; look like a pandemic story at all. The U.S. mortality disadvantage has been growing at about the same rate for years, and while it spiked during COVID-19, it still continues to rise.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0cya000n3b79bc9nwgyz@published"&gt;Here’s another way to put this: In 2023 there were about 700,000 “missing Americans”—those who died in 2023 but would be alive if they had lived somewhere else. And that 700,000 is almost exactly the number that we could’ve predicted back in 2019, based solely on prepandemic trends. COVID and relatively low vaccine adoption are a problem for Americans. But our country seems to be, at a deeper level, a deadly place to live. What’s more, all of the studies we have (with some limited exceptions, like a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2836256"&gt;study specific to California&lt;/a&gt;) stop before Donald Trump began his second term with enormous cuts to medical and health research and, now, to Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0d1j000o3b791106vxt1@published"&gt;There is a heated—and productive—debate about exactly why the U.S. is so much worse than our peers at keeping its populace alive. One influential theory focuses on deindustrialization and the way that Americans without a college degree in particular have been left behind. Another focuses on the way that social safety nets in this country, such as for unemployment, sickness, and pensions, remain small and insufficient compared with other wealthy countries. Others point to problems in the U.S. health care system, such as uninsurance, underinsurance, and high co-payments and deductibles, and to underlying trends in chronic diseases that might be caused by nutritional policy failures. Still others highlight America’s permissive gun laws and the large amount of time we spend in our cars.&lt;/p&gt;

And that population is a worrisome one: Americans early in their adulthood, those aged 25 to 44—that is, millennials, as well as some older members of Gen Z .&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0ddh000r3b799ujnlqt0@published"&gt;Before 2010, the estimated lifespan for American early adults increased every year. Deaths from HIV and cancer were plummeting. Homicides had fallen dramatically, and fatalities from circulatory disease, a major cause of death at every adult age, were also falling in this age group. But sometime after 2010, for almost every cause of death, this changed. Early adults proved especially susceptible to drug overdose deaths as synthetic fentanyl swept the country, but also became increasingly likely to die in car collisions and from digestive diseases and diabetes, and stopped making much progress in death rates from circulatory disease.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0dgp000s3b790a8ux7nu@published"&gt;Just as for other adult age groups, when COVID-19 arrived in 2020 and 2021, mortality increased markedly among early adults. Alongside COVID-19 deaths were major increases in deaths from drug overdose, transportation, alcohol, homicide, circulatory disease, suicide, and other causes, as the country’s social structures and health system buckled under the stress of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0dk8000t3b79kucgo8cx@published"&gt;But when older adults’ death rates plummeted after the pandemic, early adults lost only a little over half of the additional deaths that the pandemic years had brought. Before the pandemic, early adults’ mortality trends closely mirrored other adult age groups. Since COVID-19, their increased mortality is unique.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0dni000u3b79hmzx07t8@published"&gt;The result of all this? By 2023, American early adults’ chance of dying was 70 percent higher than it would have been had the lifesaving trends of the early 2000s continued. And this leaves them 2.6 times as likely to die as early adults in other rich countries. Amid declining economic prospects and future optimism among younger American adults, perhaps no statistic more starkly captures the disadvantage of entering adulthood in the U.S. today.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0dqr000v3b79kwqi56lk@published"&gt;We don’t know exactly why this is happening. Some changes related to the pandemic seem relatively obvious: employment loss and insecurity that disproportionately impacted younger workers, increased alcohol consumption and drug use, and coincided with high rates of depression that continued to distinctly affect early adults following the peak pandemic. This age group experienced hardships during COVID-19 that are difficult to bounce back from.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0dym000x3b79w2epwcj6@published"&gt;People who are 25 to 44 have experienced major turning points in this country’s history: The oldest of them were Reagan babies who launched their careers in the shadow of the Great Recession, and the youngest entered adulthood during a worldwide pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0e28000y3b7971895xgp@published"&gt;In the 2028 election, millennial and Gen Z voters will account for half of the U.S. electorate. Many of these early adults are disillusioned with a political and economic system that does not provide living wages, stable employment, housing security, or affordable health care. As social mobility in the U.S. has decreased, the prospect of homeownership and marriage has also become unattainable for many early adults, regardless of how hard they work. And now millennial and Gen Z Americans are far more likely to die than their age peers in other rich nations.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiw0e4s000z3b7903podtn9@published"&gt;These economic and health inequities are likely to further increase with cuts to the country’s social safety net, including to programs such as Medicaid, to pay for tax cuts for high earners. Technological advancements may lead to widening income inequality if stable jobs are replaced by A.I. Investing in millennials and Gen Z should be a top policy priority. Politicians looking to win votes would do well to make it a key part of their campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

I do believe that this will become more of an increasing problem as time goes on,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan noted that it's 'extremely unlikely' that CRPV will eventually jump to humans, even as cases among rabbits grow, but he admitted that it's not completely impossible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can never say never with science or with viruses, because they always mutate and things can change very fast, but I don't see that happening in the near future with CRPV,' the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest sightings posted on social media have moved north of Colorado, reaching several major cities in central Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a series of pictures posted to Reddit in late July, one person revealed that infected rabbits were now in Saint Paul. Others reported seeing them in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We live in Plymouth, and our neighborhood bunnies have the same thing,' another Minnesota resident added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A video posted to X on August 18 captured a rabbit with its face covered in CRPV growths in Sioux Falls, South Dakota - nearly 500 miles from the sightings in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The virus is not thought to be painful unless the growths affect a rabbit's eyes or mouth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Another Reddit user captured images of a rabbit in Colorado (pictured) exhibiting the early stages of the disease spreading throughout the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first sign that a rabbit has the virus is red, raised spots on their skin that eventually turn into wart-like tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In many cases, these warts develop into keratinized papillomas, the 'horns' and 'tentacles' seen growing out of midwestern rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, some of the warts can turn into a squamous cell carcinoma, a serious skin cancer that can be deadly if it spreads and isn't treated early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan noted that even if the warts don't turn cancerous, they can continue to grow for years and become a major vulnerability to rabbits in the wild. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What can happen is they can obstruct their vision, it can get close to their mouths, and it can prevent them from feeding properly, and they can even starve,' the medical expert explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For others, it can make them more vulnerable to predators. So, it can certainly do harm.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Awan claimed climate change was the driving force behind the widespread increase in sightings this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is the time when mosquitoes and ticks thrive in these warmer temperatures, so because they're able to thrive, they're able to infect more rabbits, and hence, we're getting more CRPV cases,' Dr Awan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it's not just cases of rabbit diseases that are going up. Cases of Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in humans have risen in the US in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These temperature changes are resulting in diseases that were never endemic in certain areas to become endemic,' Dr Awan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you take a look at Lyme disease, for example, we're starting to see it in areas that we never saw it before... places like southern Canada, northern states on the East Coast, like Maine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Obesity drugs such as &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-3"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/NVO/"&gt;Novo Nordisk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'s Wegovy and &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-4"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/LLY/"&gt;Eli Lilly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'s Zepbound can also be difficult to access due to their high costs, limited U.S. insurance coverage and constrained supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, any patient can purchase a Signos membership to access its system. It uses an AI platform and an off-the-shelf continuous glucose monitor, or CGM, from &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-5"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/DXCM/"&gt;Dexcom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to offer personalized, real-time data and lifestyle recommendations for weight management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is now a solution that everybody can use to help on the weight loss journey, and you don't have to be a certain number of pounds to use it. It's available for the average American who needs it," said Sharam Fouladgar-Mercer, Signos' co-founder and CEO, in an interview on Tuesday ahead of the approval. "The average person might have five pounds to lose, or others might have 100 pounds to lose. We are here to help them at any point in that journey."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obesity epidemic costs the U.S. health-care system &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/php/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;more than $170 billion a year&lt;/a&gt;, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Almost 74% of Americans are overweight or obese, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm" target="_blank"&gt;government data&lt;/a&gt; says. Signos hopes it can make a "real big dent in that curve for the betterment of many of us," Fouladgar-Mercer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers who sign up for Signos can &lt;a href="https://store.signos.com/plan?c=fall20&amp;amp;amp;amp;_gl=1*7uhji3*_gcl_au*MTk0ODg5MDgwOS4xNjk3NDgwNDE2" target="_blank"&gt;choose&lt;/a&gt; a three-month or six-month plan, which currently costs $139 and $129, respectively. The company will ship out all of the CGMs a patient needs for the number of months in the plan they choose.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurers currently don't cover the system for weight management, but the plans are a fraction of the roughly $1,000 monthly price of GLP-1s in the U.S. Signos is working with health insurance companies and employers to get coverage for the system, the company said in a statement to CNBC. Signos said it expects "this to evolve quickly as interest for tackling weight continued to expand." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Signos system can be used in combination with GLP-1s or bariatric surgery, said Fouladgar-Mercer. He said patients can also use the system after getting off a GLP-1 to maintain their weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CGMs are small sensors worn on the upper arm that track glucose levels, mainly for people with diabetes. That data is wirelessly sent to Signos' app, which also allows patients to log their food intake and exercise levels, among other information that the AI platform uses to make recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from helping people lose pounds, the system aims to help users understand how their bodies respond to specific foods and exercise patterns and make the right behavioral changes to manage and maintain their weight in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signos did not share how many patients are currently using its glucose monitoring system, but Fouladgar-Mercer said tens of thousands of people have already tried it over time. He said Signos has scaled up its CGM inventory and software capacity to "handle a pretty massive scale" following the approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 04:02:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNWUhhLVF4RTQ3ZWVfQ1lxbVpZSjNwVXVLNW9rMW5iZkpxaWlSMmo5SHdzZGl3UFdzaGt5ZTFxSTdxaVByblJVaFQ4VUF0ZWtjclBFSnc5akNFU294cVlhT2ZxSnUtT3lIQ20yWF83TEpoYzM1ajZvQVFsNEZESWJpQzB4QUtaamc4ZnFmN2hWZU5QZXVBTGfSAZsBQVVfeXFMTVB0SGJ1RDlLSF9FOTZsX2U3U0MtempzY1pPYmZTb0lBa1EwTFFGMldsdlFCMmxvenY5TERsNHE2bW5BWjVjbTNIVWNuV2ZEdnF6X3JfY3d1TTdkLW5pYm5pc29NVzlJU2hEQlY5OUNsUHRxM0Flb2lSMFd2T25UT1VfQk5KYzY4ZXktbm93TENjdFlXTHNxdVpoSXM</guid></item><item><title>我们并不特别：一本新书挑战人类例外论-黑客新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWEFVX3lxTFBnZzFURV9PTVVqdTFkcG9tSkRpN3RqTTNaT2NMRFpzZjRoUTNZRW1RYnRQaTF3cVFZMEo2MWhOVU9yaDNTMjJ2TnJqaHh2TTQxRUpVVDBHUEI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hacker News</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 02:51:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWEFVX3lxTFBnZzFURV9PTVVqdTFkcG9tSkRpN3RqTTNaT2NMRFpzZjRoUTNZRW1RYnRQaTF3cVFZMEo2MWhOVU9yaDNTMjJ2TnJqaHh2TTQxRUpVVDBHUEI</guid></item><item><title>加州居民鼠疫检测呈阳性。官员指责太浩湖跳蚤-洛杉矶时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNOHl1bTh3ZXNOTmE3OTFNSVprR0poeHY3MVZocXV4ajVtOXJKZ2hld19BMWQ1MUxIOTZlV3NVV0NTQjRXNWZDeFFkT1hrQTYyNndtWnJzRFdwWVdnWnZCSEM5U2J5T29GcFJwbGgtbThRRzZXMVVzNWFycHlveGg2RWZpcFFMME9KZmptU1ZoeXJRTXlkZjBhVzRpb2xWVkJVeHpVeDlEYXJQZEtRc0Etck1QZlBRWGV0eXpsbU1WeUQzc0dSTnY2RQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cms-font-brand-text font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;A South Lake Tahoe resident has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-plague-yosemite-20150819-story.html"&gt;tested positive for the plague&lt;/a&gt; — yes, the same pest-transmitted disease estimated to have killed 25 million Europeans in the Middle Ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is believed that the person contracted the rare and dangerous disease after being bitten by an infected flea while camping in the South Lake Tahoe area, according to El Dorado County health officials. The patient is under the care of a medical professional and recovering at home, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Plague is naturally present in many parts of California, including higher-elevation areas of El Dorado County,” Kyle Fliflet,  the county’s acting director of public health, said in a statement. “It’s important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking and/or camping in areas where wild rodents are present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plague is a very serious disease but can be treated with easily available antibiotics, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sooner a patient is diagnosed and receives treatment, the greater their chances of making a full recovery, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is caused by the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Yersinia pestis &lt;/i&gt;and is most commonly spread to humans by bites from infected fleas, according to El Dorado County health officials. The disease can also be spread by infected-rodent bites or by exposure to infected dogs and cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is extremely uncommon and infects on average seven people in the U.S. per year, according to the CDC. Nevertheless, it must be taken seriously because of the high potential for death if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last plague case reported in El Dorado County was in 2020 and was also believed to be transmitted in the South Lake Tahoe area, health officials said. Two California plague cases were &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-plague-yosemite-20150819-story.html"&gt;reported in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, probably caused by bites from an infected flea or rodent in Yosemite National Park. All three patients received treatment and made a full recovery, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 45 ground squirrels or chipmunks recorded with evidence of exposure to the plague bacterium in the Lake Tahoe Basin from 2021 to the present, according to the California Department of Public Health, which routinely monitors rodent populations for plague activity across the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Dorado County health officials urged residents and visitors to take steps to avoid exposure to rodents or ticks when exploring the wilderness around Lake Tahoe.  Measures include wearing long pants tucked into boots, using a bug repellent with DEET, never feeding or touching rodents, refraining from camping near animal burrows or dead rodents, and leaving dogs at home when possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 80% of plague cases in the U.S. have been in the bubonic form, from which patients will develop swollen, painful lymph nodes called buboes, according to the CDC. This form of the disease typically results from an infected-flea bite, and symptoms such as buboes, fever, headache, chills and weakness develop within two to eight days, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, an &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-07-12/northern-arizona-resident-dies-from-plague"&gt;Arizona resident died&lt;/a&gt; of the pneumonic form of the plague, which can develop when bacteria spread to the lungs of a patient with untreated bubonic plague. This is the most serious form of the plague and can have an incubation period of just one day. It’s also the only form of the plague that can spread from human to human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Middle Ages, infected rats were to blame for the  Black Death in Europe in the 14th century. The last urban rat-infected plague outbreak in America &lt;a class="link" href="https://la.curbed.com/2020/4/9/21211280/quarantine-plague-los-angeles-mexican-district" target="_blank"&gt;took place in Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; in 1924 and 1925, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 02:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNOHl1bTh3ZXNOTmE3OTFNSVprR0poeHY3MVZocXV4ajVtOXJKZ2hld19BMWQ1MUxIOTZlV3NVV0NTQjRXNWZDeFFkT1hrQTYyNndtWnJzRFdwWVdnWnZCSEM5U2J5T29GcFJwbGgtbThRRzZXMVVzNWFycHlveGg2RWZpcFFMME9KZmptU1ZoeXJRTXlkZjBhVzRpb2xWVkJVeHpVeDlEYXJQZEtRc0Etck1QZlBRWGV0eXpsbU1WeUQzc0dSTnY2RQ</guid></item><item><title>南太浩湖居民鼠疫检测呈阳性，可能被受感染的跳蚤叮咬- KCRA</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxNRm01cmhuNDBzSzJGU0NiRWV3R0N2Q1UyaDFvVUJUSjhMY0lyR0FZYmd0QXNLQWlFaHFqVTBOZEFyaE8zRDExcGFYNlVyWUJnR01RWXlDencyb3JYYVZVU0s1NXpteG4yTWMtTE1tY0Q2Vm5YNHQ5QmE0WTdQdm9Fd3Z3QTY4OGktX2FYWW9nZkNRYnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-content--body-text-raw"&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="375" data-end="621"&gt;Serums help—no question. But the cells that build collagen, calm redness, and repair damage run on what we eat and drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="375" data-end="621"&gt;The nutrients that travel through your bloodstream reach places creams can’t: they nourish skin cells from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="623" data-end="936"&gt;That’s why dermatologists and dietitians increasingly point to diet as a cornerstone of skin health. Plant-derived antioxidants and vitamins don’t just protect against sun and pollution damage—they measurably improve hydration, elasticity, and barrier function over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="938" data-end="1274"&gt;So if your routine stops at the bathroom mirror, you’re only getting half the picture. Juicing plants that are rich in skin-supporting compounds gives you a concentrated, tasty way to work beauty from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="938" data-end="1274"&gt;Here are seven vegan blends that deliver flavor, science-backed benefits, and practical tips you can fold into everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1281" data-end="1332"&gt;1. Carrot-orange-turmeric for a vitamin A glow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1334" data-end="1598"&gt;Carrots are famous for their beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A that your body converts into retinol. Oranges supply vitamin C, which helps collagen strands stay firm, while turmeric provides curcumin, one of the most researched natural anti-inflammatories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1600" data-end="1975"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1600" data-end="1617"&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Vitamin A supports cell turnover—think fresher, smoother-looking skin. Vitamin C builds resilience against UV damage and keeps collagen intact. Turmeric’s curcumin reduces inflammatory pathways that can worsen redness or breakouts. A &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2025.1559032/full"&gt;2025 study in &lt;em data-start="1866" data-end="1893"&gt;Frontiers in Pharmacology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; linked curcumin to improved wound healing and reduced oxidative stress in skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1977" data-end="2226"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1977" data-end="1996"&gt;How to make it:&lt;/strong&gt; Juice 4 medium carrots, 2 peeled oranges, and a thumb-sized knob of turmeric root. If you only have turmeric powder, stir in ½ teaspoon afterward. Add a pinch of black pepper—it helps your body absorb curcumin more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2228" data-end="2368"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2228" data-end="2242"&gt;Extra tip:&lt;/strong&gt; This juice keeps its bright orange pigment because of carotenoids. Store it in a glass jar, not plastic, to avoid staining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2375" data-end="2424"&gt;2. Cucumber-mint-lime for hydration and calm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2426" data-end="2600"&gt;Cucumbers are 96% water, but the real star is silica, a trace mineral linked to collagen production. Mint soothes digestion, and lime adds vitamin C with a refreshing tang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2602" data-end="2965"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2602" data-end="2619"&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Hydration plumps skin cells in a way moisturizers alone can’t. Meanwhile, vitamin C is a crucial cofactor for repairing micro-damage from sun exposure and keeping collagen production on track. Together, this combo supports both skin smoothness and overall calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2967" data-end="3115"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2967" data-end="2986"&gt;How to make it:&lt;/strong&gt; Juice 1 large cucumber with a handful of fresh mint and the juice of ½ lime. Chill before drinking for that spa-water upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3117" data-end="3243"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3117" data-end="3131"&gt;Extra tip:&lt;/strong&gt; If you want more body, blend instead of juicing. The fiber slows down absorption and keeps you fuller longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3250" data-end="3309"&gt;3. Beet-apple-ginger for circulation and detox support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3311" data-end="3549"&gt;Beets are rich in dietary nitrates that convert to nitric oxide, a compound that widens blood vessels and improves circulation. Apples bring quercetin, a flavonoid that reduces oxidative stress, while ginger adds anti-inflammatory zing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3551" data-end="3959"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3551" data-end="3568"&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8565237/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that beet juice significantly improves blood flow and reduced oxidative stress markers. Increased circulation means more oxygen and nutrients reach your skin cells, giving that natural post-exercise flush without the treadmill. Quercetin helps reduce UV-related skin stress, while gingerol compounds lower markers of systemic inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3961" data-end="4133"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3961" data-end="3980"&gt;How to make it:&lt;/strong&gt; Juice 1 medium beet, 2 crisp apples, and a thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger. If the beet flavor is too earthy, add a squeeze of lemon to brighten it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4135" data-end="4257"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4135" data-end="4149"&gt;Extra tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Beets stain everything. Rinse your juicer parts right away, or you’ll be scrubbing pink streaks for days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4264" data-end="4317"&gt;4. Kale-pineapple-lemon for collagen and clarity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4319" data-end="4550"&gt;Dark leafy greens like kale offer lutein and vitamin K, both linked to healthier skin tone and reduced oxidative stress. Pineapple supplies bromelain, an enzyme with gentle exfoliating properties, while lemon adds more vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4552" data-end="4935"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4552" data-end="4569"&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Lutein has been shown in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464620304898"&gt;controlled trials&lt;/a&gt; to increase skin’s resistance to UV-induced damage. Vitamin K helps reduce the appearance of dark under-eye circles by supporting capillary strength. Bromelain may help calm puffiness and mild inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4937" data-end="5071"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4937" data-end="4956"&gt;How to make it:&lt;/strong&gt; Juice 2 cups chopped kale, 1 cup pineapple chunks, and ½ peeled lemon. For a milder flavor, add half a cucumber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5073" data-end="5172"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5073" data-end="5087"&gt;Extra tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Roll your kale leaves before juicing to release more juice and fewer bitter notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5179" data-end="5236"&gt;5. Pomegranate-blueberry for anti-aging antioxidants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5238" data-end="5506"&gt;Pomegranates and blueberries are loaded with polyphenols. These compounds neutralize free radicals—the unstable molecules that accelerate wrinkles and sagging. They also contain ellagic acid and anthocyanins, which protect collagen and help reduce hyperpigmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5508" data-end="5747"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5508" data-end="5525"&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/pomegranate-juice-and-extract-consumption-by-healthy-women-increases-resistance-to-sun-damage"&gt;Research from UCLA&lt;/a&gt; found that pomegranate extract reduce resistance to sun damage. Anthocyanins in blueberries also strengthen tiny blood vessels, which supports even skin tone and reduces visible redness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5749" data-end="5954"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5749" data-end="5768"&gt;How to make it:&lt;/strong&gt; Blend (not juice) 1 cup pomegranate arils, 1 cup blueberries, and ½ cup water. Strain if you prefer a smoother texture, but keeping the fiber helps regulate blood sugar and digestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5956" data-end="6086"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5956" data-end="5970"&gt;Extra tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Frozen blueberries work as well as fresh here—and they’re often picked at peak ripeness, preserving antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6093" data-end="6144"&gt;6. Celery-pear-parsley for clarity and balance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6146" data-end="6371"&gt;Celery has become trendy for a reason: its mineral salts may support hydration balance and reduce puffiness. Pears provide gentle fiber, easing digestion, while parsley adds chlorophyll, which supports liver detox pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6373" data-end="6694"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6373" data-end="6390"&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Many skin issues are tied to digestion. A healthier gut translates to clearer, calmer skin. Chlorophyll has been studied for its antioxidant capacity, reducing markers of oxidative stress in animal and human models. Pairing it with celery’s natural electrolytes makes this juice a great morning reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6696" data-end="6850"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6696" data-end="6715"&gt;How to make it:&lt;/strong&gt; Juice 3 celery stalks, 1 ripe pear, and a small handful of parsley. Drink in the morning to start the day with a mineral-rich boost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6852" data-end="6945"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6852" data-end="6866"&gt;Extra tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Use the whole pear with skin—it’s where much of the antioxidant power lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6952" data-end="7012"&gt;7. Watermelon-strawberry-basil for hydration and repair&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7014" data-end="7225"&gt;Watermelon is rich in lycopene, an antioxidant that accumulates in the skin and helps protect against sun damage. Strawberries are vitamin C superstars, while basil brings antibacterial and calming properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7227" data-end="7515"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7227" data-end="7244"&gt;Why it works:&lt;/strong&gt; Lycopene has been shown in multiple studies, including a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11179732/"&gt;2024 &lt;em data-start="7307" data-end="7337"&gt;Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism &lt;/em&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, to reduce UV-induced redness and oxidative stress. Vitamin C powers collagen synthesis. Together, this combo is tailor-made for summer when sun exposure is unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7517" data-end="7639"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7517" data-end="7536"&gt;How to make it:&lt;/strong&gt; Blend 2 cups watermelon, 1 cup strawberries, and 4–5 basil leaves until smooth. Serve cold over ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7641" data-end="7723"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7641" data-end="7655"&gt;Extra tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Watermelon juice separates quickly—give it a stir before sipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7730" data-end="7765"&gt;How to make juice work for you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7767" data-end="7913"&gt;Juicing doesn’t have to mean buying $12 green bottles at a boutique café. With a little strategy, it can become a sustainable, affordable habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="7915" data-end="8479"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7915" data-end="8008"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7917" data-end="8008"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7917" data-end="7943"&gt;No juicer? No problem.&lt;/strong&gt; Use a blender and strain through a nut milk bag or fine sieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="8009" data-end="8152"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8011" data-end="8152"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="8011" data-end="8027"&gt;Drink fresh.&lt;/strong&gt; Nutrients degrade quickly. Ideally, consume juice within 20 minutes, or store in an airtight glass jar for up to 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="8153" data-end="8259"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8155" data-end="8259"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="8155" data-end="8174"&gt;Balance sugars.&lt;/strong&gt; Too much fruit can spike blood sugar. Pair sweeter juices with greens or cucumber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="8260" data-end="8373"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8262" data-end="8373"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="8262" data-end="8285"&gt;Consistency counts.&lt;/strong&gt; Just like topical skincare, results show with regular use—2–3 times a week is plenty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="8374" data-end="8479"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8376" data-end="8479"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="8376" data-end="8403"&gt;Think of it as synergy.&lt;/strong&gt; Juices complement, not replace, a plant-forward diet rich in whole foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8486" data-end="8507"&gt;Why this matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8509" data-end="8798"&gt;This isn’t just about glowing skin. Choosing plant-powered juices aligns with bigger goals: climate resilience, sustainable agriculture, and community health. Each glass reduces reliance on animal-based products and packaged, single-use plastics tied to the conventional beauty industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8800" data-end="9033"&gt;By leaning on carrots instead of collagen powders, or parsley instead of pills, you’re supporting local farmers, cutting environmental costs, and proving that wellness doesn’t have to come in a jar shipped halfway around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9035" data-end="9264"&gt;Skin health, climate health, and community health are inseparable. Every time you juice beets, blend berries, or stir turmeric into a glass, you’re investing in your own resilience and the planet’s. That’s beauty with benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these, 21 looked at use of e-cigarettes among young people and later cigarette smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/"&gt;Tobacco Control&lt;/a&gt;, the authors said the data available 'consistently indicated a significant association between e-cigarette use and later cigarette smoking in young people'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said it was difficult to 'infer causality' from their review, but the 'repeated strong associations in prospective cohort studies are consistent with a causal relationship'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis also&lt;span&gt; suggested an increased risk among young people who vape of developing asthma or asthma exacerbation, they added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other harmful outcomes linked to youth vaping included pneumonia, bronchitis, lower total sperm counts, dizziness, headaches and migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There was also a link identified between depression and suicidal thoughts among young vapers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Su Golder, associate professor in health science at the University of York, said: 'The consistency in the evidence is striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Across multiple studies, young people who use e-cigarettes are more likely to smoke in the future. These findings support stronger public health measures to protect teens from the risks associated with vaping.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Greg Hartwell, clinical assistant professor at LSHTM, said: 'We found consistent evidence around transitions to smoking which of course, in turn, opens the door to the multitude of harms that conventional cigarettes bring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As the UK Government's chief medical officer states, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12316343/Disposable-vapes-restricted-like-tobacco-order-clamp-UKs-kid-e-cig-epidemic-senior-Tory-MP-claims.html"&gt;marketing vapes to children&lt;/a&gt; is always unacceptable, and our review shows exactly why further restrictions on the tobacco industry, who control the vaping market, are so important.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rebecca Glover, senior author of the study, assistant professor at LSHTM, added: 'Vaping is having a detrimental impact on the health of young people globally and vaping appears to be a gateway to other substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our study provides the strongest evidence to date that young people globally face a serious range of physical and psychological harms from vaping and are at higher risk of transitioning to smoking.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But other experts today, who weren't involved in the research, labelled the findings 'overspeculation' and warned the studies analysed were observational or low quality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Ann McNeill, an expert in tobacco addiction at King College &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-536ffe90-7d11-11f0-96e6-590b241915e8"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, said: 'It reported on 56 systematic reviews of which 53 were rated critically low or low quality, meaning authors should be extremely cautious before making any conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The authors reported that the reviews found consistently that vaping was associated with subsequent smoking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This replicates the findings of many previous reviews and indeed research I have been involved in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Campaigners have long blamed predatory manufacturers for the ever-growing crisis, claiming they are intentionally luring kids in with colourful packaging, compared to highlighter pens, and child-friendly flavours such as bubblegum and cotton candy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, the authors incorrectly state that this supports "a causal relationship". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'in other words that vaping causes smoking—the so-called 'gateway' effect. It is well-established that consistency does not mean causality.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;span&gt;Dr Emma Beard, an associate professor in statistics and quantitative methods at University College London, said: 'The conclusion that vaping acts as a "gateway" is an overspeculation, especially when the paper notes that at a population level, smoking rates have generally fallen as vaping has risen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'While protecting youth is vital, this review clearly shows the current evidence base on this topic has some significant weaknesses.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;E-cigs allow people to inhale nicotine in a vapour—which is produced by heating a liquid, which typically contains propylene glycol, glycerine, flavourings, and other chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike traditional cigarettes, they do not contain tobacco, nor do they produce tar or carbon—two of the most dangerous elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nicotine's effect on the brain is well known—within 20 seconds of inhalation, it triggers the release of chemical messengers such as dopamine, associated with reward and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it also increases heart rate and blood pressure and makes blood vessels constrict. This is because nicotine triggers the release of the hormone adrenaline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-7d2499e0-cd16-11ef-b756-1d55513ec566"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; chiefs insisting it is safer than smoking, vaping is not risk-free. E-cigarettes can contain harmful toxins and their long-term effects remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are also concerned the high nicotine content might increase blood pressure and cause other heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, in world-first guidance setting out possible interventions to help people stop using tobacco products, the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13592791/World-Health-Organizations-war-vapes-continues-body-rules-devices-recommended-help-people-quit-smoking-contrary-NHS-advice.html"&gt;World Health Organization labelled the evidence&lt;/a&gt; around e-cigarettes as 'complex'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vapes could not be recommended as way to stop smoking as too little is known about the harms and benefits, the UN agency said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In June, in a bid to tackle the surge in youth vaping, it was made illegal for &lt;span&gt;businesses to sell or supply single-use vapes, such as Elf bars and Lost Mary, in shops and online.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only devices considered reusable—with a rechargeable battery and replaceable coil—are now allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Type 2 diabetes is a complex condition where the body struggles to manage blood sugar levels.

With over 536 million people affected globally in 2021 (and that number expected to rise), diabetes is a growing concern.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the reevaluation of studies, the daily dose of turmeric or curcumin ranged from as low as 80 mg to as high as 2100 mg. The duration of these studies varied, too, lasting anywhere from eight weeks to 36 weeks. The interventions were categorized into three types: unformulated curcumin, high-absorption curcumin and turmeric. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A total of 14 clinical trials studied the effects of turmeric or curcumin on body weight in people with type 2 diabetes. The combined results showed that turmeric/curcumin supplementation led to an average weight loss of 1.9 kg (or about 4.2 pounds) compared to the placebo. Additionally, participants with a body mass index (BMI) under 30 saw a greater weight reduction of 2.2 kg (about 4.8 pounds). These findings suggest turmeric may have an impact on weight management, especially in certain groups.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other findings included that among participants with type 2 diabetes, turmeric/curcumin supplementation modestly reduced waist and hip circumference, but had little effect on BMI and body fat percentage. As for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/risk-factors-prediabetes-8733895" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;people with prediabetes&lt;/a&gt;, three trials suggested that turmeric/curcumin supplements modestly reduced body weight when taken over 22 weeks, and turmeric/curcumin was also connected to a small reduction in waist circumference. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While this study provides valuable insights into the potential benefits of turmeric and curcumin for managing body weight and measurements in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, it has some limitations. The quality of evidence in many of the included trials was rated as low or very low, partly due to inconsistencies in results and differences in study designs, doses and durations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, the high variability between studies makes it harder to draw definitive conclusions. Most trials had small sample sizes, and some relied on self-reported data, which can introduce bias. Furthermore, the study excluded certain populations, such as pregnant women and those using turmeric alongside other treatments, limiting its generalizability. Finally, while turmeric and curcumin showed promise in some areas, the effects were often modest, highlighting that taking this supplement is unlikely to be a magic bullet for seeing noticeable outcomes for some. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re managing prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, the idea of adding a turmeric or curcumin supplement to your routine might sound appealing, especially since it’s a natural and more budget-friendly option. The research suggests that turmeric could help with small but meaningful improvements in weight and waist size, particularly when taken in higher doses (over 1500 mg/day) or for longer periods (more than 22 weeks). That said, most turmeric or curcumin supplements usually have between 500 and 1,000 milligrams of curcumin per serving—and you should check in with a healthcare professional before taking a new supplement, especially one with a high dosage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, people with prediabetes saw an average weight loss of 2.5 kg (about 5.5 pounds) and a reduction in waist circumference of nearly 3 cm (about 1.2 inches). While these changes aren’t dramatic, they could be a helpful addition to a broader plan that includes healthy eating, exercise, and regular medical care.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, turmeric isn’t a quick fix or a replacement for other treatments. Its effects are modest, and not everyone will see the same results. If you’re considering turmeric or curcumin supplements, it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider first, especially if you’re already on medication for diabetes or other conditions. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-herbal-supplements-interfere-with-medications-8714553" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Supplements can interact with medications&lt;/a&gt;, and not all products are created equal. For example, some may not contain the right dose or form of curcumin to be effective. Ultimately, while turmeric shows promise, it works best as part of a well-rounded approach to managing diabetes and overall health.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrition &amp;amp; Diabetes,&lt;/em&gt; highlights the potential of turmeric as a natural, more budget-friendly supplement that may support weight management and reduce waist size in people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. But it is important to remember that while the results are promising, the effects are modest and vary depending on factors like dosage, duration and individual health conditions. Turmeric is not a cure-all, but it could serve as a helpful addition to a comprehensive diabetes management plan that includes a healthy diet, regular exercise and medical care. For those looking for alternative ways to support their health, turmeric offers a safe and accessible option worth considering under the guidance of your healthcare provider.

The organization recommended children aged 6 months to 23 months should receive COVID-19 vaccines unless they have allergies to the ingredients.

&lt;p&gt;"It's clear that we're in a different place in the pandemic than we were four or five years ago in terms of risks to healthy older kids," Sean O'Leary, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases (COID) said in a statement. However, "the risk of hospitalization for young children and those with high-risk conditions remains pretty high."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-06-25-26/02-MacNeil-COVID-508.pdf"&gt;According to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, the rate of COVID-19 hospitalization in children under 2 is the highest among any pediatric group. Further, the rate of hospitalization among children 6 months to 23 months is comparable to that of adults ages 50 to 64. Critically, more than half of children aged 6 months to 23 months who are hospitalized for COVID-19 have no underlying medical condition that puts them at high risk for severe infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For children 2 to 18, the AAP recommends COVID-19 shots for children who have a medical condition that puts them at &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-072788/202525/Hospitalization-for-COVID-19-and-Risk-Factors-for"&gt;high risk&lt;/a&gt;, are residents of care facilities, have never been vaccinated, or have household contacts who are high risk of severe COVID-19. All other children and teens should also have access to updated seasonal shots if they desire them, the AAP says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children, and adolescents," Kressly said. "Pediatricians know how important routine childhood immunizations are in keeping children, families, and their communities healthy and thriving."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coverage questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With school starting, COVID-19 cases ticking up around the country, and cold-weather respiratory virus season looming, the question now is how the conflicting recommendations will be interpreted by insurance companies. Insurers are required to cover vaccines recommended by the CDC. But there is no such obligation for recommendations from medical groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AAP has been holding meetings with insurers to press for continued coverage of evidence-based vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'Leary &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/19/kids-vaccines-american-academy-pediatrics-rfk-cdc/"&gt;told The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; that insurers are "signaling that they are committed to covering our recommendations.” The Post also noted that AHIP, the major insurance lobby, released &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/articles/health-plans-continued-commitment-to-vaccine-access"&gt;a statement in June&lt;/a&gt; saying its members are committed to "ongoing coverage of vaccines to ensure access and affordability for this respiratory virus season."&lt;/p&gt;

Four to six cups of very hot liquids carried a 3.7-times higher risk of the cancer, and six to eight cups was associated with 4.8-fold increased risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For hot beverages, up to four cups a day carried an increased risk of 1.6 times. Four to six cups a day was associated with an increased cancer risk of two times; six to eight cups carried a 2.5-fold higher risk; and more than eight was associated with a three-times higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said their findings, published in the British Journal of Cancer, build on previous research that suggests beverages at very hot temperatures, more than 149 degrees Fahrenheit, are 'probably carcinogenic to humans'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ideal brewing temperature for coffee is generally between 195 to 205F. For tea, the optimal brewing temperature varies by type, but is often around 175 to 212F. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This places hot beverages in the same risk category as things like emissions from indoor wood smoke or consuming high amounts of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Your daily coffee habit could increase your risk of cancer by up to nearly sixfold, startling research suggests (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, people typically drink coffee and tea at slightly cooler temperatures, often between 120 to 155F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is believed that hot drinks might cause damage to the body by burning cells, which may lead to inflammation that damages genes and makes it more likely that cancer develops. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vincent Ho, associate professor and clinical academic gastroenterologist at Western Sydney University, wrote for The Conversation: 'Drinking a lot of very hot drinks can damage cells in the esophagus lining, and it’s believed over time this can lead to cancer developing. Researchers first proposed this link almost 90 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What we know about how hot drinks can damage the esophagus mainly comes from animal studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Another theory is that heat damage to the esophagus lining weakens its normal barrier, increasing the risk of further damage from gastric acid reflux (from the stomach). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Over time, this chronic damage can increase the chance of esophageal cancer developing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also thought that tissues damaged by the hot liquids may become more vulnerable to other things that can cause cancer, like alcohol and chemicals in tobacco smoke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team at the National Cancer Institute stated that 'individuals who like their beverages very hot might benefit from reducing the temperature of their drinks, at least with regards to their risk of esophageal cancer'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This year, experts predict more than 22,000 new esophageal cancer cases will be diagnosed with just over 16,000 deaths from the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Esophageal cancer starts at the inside lining of the esophagus and spreads outward through the other layers as it grows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms often include difficulty swallowing, unintended weight loss, and chest pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These symptoms can be subtle at first but tend to worsen as the cancer progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other possible symptoms include a persistent cough, hoarseness, and heartburn that gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This year, experts predict more than 22,000 new esophageal cancer cases will be diagnosed with just over 16,000 deaths from the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there aren't routine screening tests for esophageal cancer, various procedures can help diagnose it, including endoscopy with biopsy, imaging scans, and specialized tests like the Cytosponge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Endoscopy allows for direct visualization and tissue sampling, while imaging helps determine the extent of the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Cytosponge, a newer test, involves swallowing a sponge to collect cells for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sometimes, healthcare providers can do surgery to remove small tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, because only 25 percent of people with this cancer receive a diagnosis before the cancer spreads, it can make it more difficult to treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Esophageal cancer poses a challenge for early diagnosis because it often doesn't present with noticeable symptoms until the cancer has reached an advanced stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Late diagnosis significantly increases the danger of esophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Localized esophageal cancer (stage I) has a five-year survival rate of around 46 percent, while stage IV cancers, which have spread to distant organs, have a very low five-year survival rate of only about five percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A majority of Americans consume hot drinks daily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is estimated that around two thirds drink coffee daily, making it the most popular hot beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to one study in 2018, the ideal temperature for drinking coffee, taking into account both the risk of esophageal injury and the preservation of flavor, was found to be approximately 136F. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said this temperature allows for a pleasant drinking experience while minimizing potential harm to the esophagus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Offering some other tips to safe drinking, Professor Ho adds: 'Slow down, take your time and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Allowing time for a very hot drink to cool is important and research has shown a hot drink’s temperature can drop by 50F to 59F in five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Finally, small sips are a good idea to test the temperature, given we know having a large amount has a significant impact on the temperature inside the esophagus and potential damage to its lining.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Scientists believe they have discovered a way to test which lifestyle changes could combat the condition, such as adopting the Mediterranean diet and eating less fermented, aged and smoked foods, although genes could also play a factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Previous studies have found 42 genes or genetic markers that may be linked with a raised risk of EDS, but researchers have now found that people who experience excessive sleepiness, known as hypersomnia, even after a full night’s sleep, often have seven key molecules linked&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; to their metabolisms circulating in their bloodstreams.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/vegetarian-diet-cuts-risk-of-sleep-apnoea-study-finds-h5w7dgkdq" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vegetarian diet cuts risk of snoring, study finds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The scientists found that foods containing the metabolite tyramine, particularly “fermented and overripe” foods, such as some aged cheeses, smoked meats and alcoholic drinks, and food that is starting to spoil, are linked with a higher risk of EDS, particularly in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The researchers also found that the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids found in vegetable oils, nuts, seeds and fatty fish commonly eaten in Mediterranean-style diets appear to be linked with a lower risk of EDS, suggesting that dietary changes could help those affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.4"&gt;&lt;div id="f0e44b3f-0324-4168-9469-a788b6275ea2"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Fatty fish such as sardines, and nuts, both prevalent in the Mediterranean diet, could lower the risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="3.5"&gt;&lt;div id="fb1cf023-fe2a-4dc5-aa33-76a60ed7ab3e"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;ADELA STEFAN/500PX/GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The NHS website explains that “excessive daytime sleepiness is different from feeling tired all the time”. It said sufferers may “regularly nap during the day, fall asleep during the day [and] still sleep for long hours at night”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;One study with European participants, which was published in the journal EBioMedicine, estimated that just under one in five people experience sleepiness levels that are significantly above normal several days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Tariq Faquih, of the sleep and circadian disorders division at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, the author of the study, said: “The metabolites we’ve identified can certainly be measured with the appropriate tools. We anticipate they’ll be most valuable following an initial assessment, ideally using sleep-lab testing or, at minimum, standardised questionnaires. Testing the metabolite levels will help determine which metabolites may require adjustment, for example through dietary interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Faquih said if people were concerned, they could take online questionnaires or use screening tools such as the &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/snorers-have-you-been-tested-for-sleep-apnoea-yet-g88x9jjdn" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;Epworth Sleepiness Scale&lt;/a&gt; before contacting their GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/foods-keep-you-younger-gvldm2wq7" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;From peanuts to pomegranates — the 19 foods that will keep you young&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;When asked about the symptoms of EDS, he said: “Some may feel constantly drowsy throughout the day, while others might experience sudden and intense sleepiness that leads to unexpected ‘sleep attacks’. In other cases, people may unintentionally fall asleep during quiet, repetitive activities like watching TV or reading. It is not always as sudden but still happens without us meaning to go to sleep.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He added: “Our study suggests diet and genetics may play an important role in EDS. As we learn what’s happening biologically, we are beginning to understand how and why EDS occurs, the early signs that someone might have it and what we can do to help patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;To combat excessive daytime sleepiness, it could be beneficial to consume more food high in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

people, particularly men, to eat less food high in tyramine, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• Fermented and pickled food&lt;br&gt;•

class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers found associations with other harmful consequences including asthma, cough, injuries and mental ill health, as well as possible risks of respiratory disease, headaches, poor oral health and substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Su Golder, an associate professor in health science at the University of York and an author of the research, said: “The consistency in the evidence is striking. Across multiple studies, young people who use e-cigarettes are more likely to smoke in the future. These findings support stronger public health measures to protect teens from the risks associated with vaping.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers concluded that although it was not yet possible to definitively say vaping leads children to smoke, precautionary policies to restrict sales and marketing of vapes to young people were needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Ronny Cheung, of the Royal College of Paediatrics, said the study “adds to the mounting evidence that youth vaping is a serious threat to health and wellbeing, with strong links to smoking and other harmful behaviours”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cheung urged the government not to further delay implementing the tobacco and vapes bill, which will limit the flavours, packaging and marketing of vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously described the rise in children vaping around the world as alarming. Figures compiled &lt;a href="https://ash.org.uk/resources/view/use-of-e-cigarettes-among-young-people-in-great-britain" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;by Action on Smoking and Health&lt;/a&gt; this year showed that 20% of 11- to 17-year-olds in Great Britain had tried vaping, amounting to an estimated 1.1 million children, triple the levels in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For the new study, which was published in the journal Tobacco Control, researchers examined 56 reviews, most of which suggested that young people who vape are about three times as likely to start smoking as those who do not vape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Asthma was the most common respiratory health condition, with consistent associations of between 20% and 36% increased risk of being diagnosed with the condition, and a 44% risk of worsening symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers acknowledged that the umbrella reviews were of variable quality and that it was difficult to prove a causal relationship since the evidence was mostly observational. They urged further research to better understand whether vapes are genuinely acting as a gateway to smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/29/third-of-uk-teenagers-who-vape-will-go-on-to-start-smoking-research-shows" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Michigan established that a third of UK teenagers who vape will go on to start smoking tobacco, meaning they are as likely to smoke as their peers in the 1970s were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hazel Cheeseman, the chief executive of Action on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/smoking" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Smoking&lt;/a&gt; and Health, said: “The rise in teen vaping in recent years is very concerning and needs urgent action from government. Vapes are effective quit aids for adults who smoke and while they are less harmful than smoking, they are not risk free and should not be used by children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Stephen Burgess, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, said the research showed “that vaping users are more likely to engage in certain behaviours, but whether vaping is truly a cause of these behaviours is beyond the scope of the data”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He added: “The associations demonstrated are both extensive in scope and strong in magnitude – it is clear that vaping users are at higher risk of many diseases than non-users. A causal explanation to the findings is both plausible and consistent with the evidence provided but such a finding can only be made conclusively by a randomised trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ann McNeill, a professor of tobacco addiction at King’s College London, noted that many of the studies on which the researchers drew for the study were “rated critically low or low quality, meaning authors should be extremely cautious before making any conclusions”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She said there could be other reasons for the consistency of the relationship between vaping and cigarette smoking – for example, a young person having a sensation-seeking or impulsive personality. Other research looking at population-level trends in vaping and smoking had found that as youth vaping increased in a population, smoking reduced, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;John Dunne, UK Vaping Industry Association director general, said: “We have seen a lot of research from the scientific community about vaping which does not stand up to scrutiny and this latest study seems to fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We need to stop demonising vaping because until the relative risks of cigarettes and vaping are understood by smokers then 220 people will needlessly die in the UK of smoking-related illnesses every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Social Care spokesperson said: “Our health advice is clear, while vapes are less harmful than smoking and can be an effective quit aid for smokers, children and non-smokers should never vape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The worrying rise in youth vaping requires attention – that’s why we commissioned this research, the largest comprehensive review of the health impacts of youth vaping to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are taking decisive action through the landmark tobacco and vapes bill and single-use vape ban, which will put an end to the cycle of addiction and stop the next generation getting hooked on nicotine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxQOW5rZGpYR2NXTjVveFh1N3ZIaUFKVWJUNW1oQVgxMDlHT295LUtsUFdFZ1QxN2pkMzBGUnN4MFRXaDBhVVFSVERJSmFPQldhWFlsV0hoZ2drNHN6djZOaWJEWl9VM1VCbURNT0RwRzRfNFpVUVhNekxCVTh6akU2VkJ2bUJ4NzdyZndqRWE2emZNcWhtZmNYS0d0V3BCN3NHNVVrS3Bwck1tbDQ0MUE</guid></item><item><title>南太浩湖居民鼠疫检测呈阳性- KOLO | 8新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQektSVGZwaHJ0VEY1TU1TUVhPZHVWcy11VWZYQ2xyQTZDWlZ4Y2htaWVRSEpwNXR6M3ZtcEFjcVIyY2tYaklpMWtjblphTE5UUE04TThrcm90S3doWS1rdVh5Q1FfWFZrRFJ3MXhpOFJKVVIyU2dGeDhMZnV1Vmg2Y3ctZUtXdGxoa0HSAZ4BQVVfeXFMT2ZNWUJ5NjlmUjBjVXZ1aHFMY3F4ZWdRMlZkRkJ0czdjQnBhSmNhN3dWWjVrbUswR2FFTWxhcENPMHQxTkx4QzV2eDg3Mks2eHlubFBwSHcwUmJwaGphd2VKR2RGbkpHdHpxdVhDUFkzR2FWUmp4VDlmbVE3ZTduWWEzRlkxQ0N3WGpsbEgzQlhKRF95ZUNqMktDQ3hDUnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, California (KOLO) - A South Lake Tahoe resident has tested positive for the plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;El Dorado County health officials say the unidentified resident is under the care of a medical professional and is recovering at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Officials say they believe the person may have been bitten by an infected flea while camping in the South Lake Tahoe area. Health officials are investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Plague is naturally present in many parts of California, including higher elevation areas of El Dorado County, said Kyle Fliflet, El Dorado County’s Acting Director of Public Health. “It’s important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking and or camping in areas where wild rodents are present,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The bacteria that causes the plague, Yersinia pestis, is most often transmitted by the bite of fleas that have acquired the bacteria from infected squirrels, chipmunks, and other wild rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Symptoms typically show up within two weeks of exposure to an infected animal or flea. Symptoms include fever, nausea, weakness, and swollen lymph nodes. The disease can be effectively treated with antibiotics if detected early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Prior to this case, the most recent case came in 2020, with the patient likely being infected in the South Lake Tahoe area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Health officials say you should never feed squirrels, touch injured or dead rodents, and never allow your pets to play with sick, injured or dead rodents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="copyright |"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 KOLO.

Ideally, it would inform adult education programs that would seek to increase skills with demonstrable effects on quality of life. “People who have literacy and numeracy skills at lower levels often must develop alternative strategies for obtaining and acting on the information they need,” Jeff Fantine, executive director of the National Coalition for Literacy, &lt;a href="https://www.proliteracy.org/news/us-adults-need-stronger-skills-to-thrive-in-a-changing-world/" target="_blank"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; ProLiteracy. “When they take advantage of adult education to improve their skills, their self-efficacy increases because they are able to handle such tasks independently. But often these adults are not aware of educational opportunities that are available to them, so we must increase awareness of, expand access to, and build capacity for adult education.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-23" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="cw"&gt;Is there any correlation between PIAAC’s assessments and a ranking of the states based on their education programs?

Dr Fiona Willer, the president of Dietitians Australia, worries about the proliferation of the devices and questions whether some people may have “fallen down a wellness rabbit hole”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-glucose" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What is glucose?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Glucose, the sugar in our blood, is “there to help fuel all of our cells – our muscle cells, brain cells, all of them – and so we do need sugar in our blood. It’s a bit like the petrol in a car,” Willer says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Any form of carbohydrate that we eat, whether that’s lollies or wholegrain bread, is turned into glucose, which makes its way into our bloodstream.” The body can also recycle glucose from the stored energy of food we’ve already eaten, Willer says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Those with diabetes need to monitor their glucose levels because their bodies have &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/diabetes-and-insulin" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;trouble making or using insulin&lt;/a&gt; – the hormone created by the pancreas that helps move glucose from our bloodstream into the body’s cells to make energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The blood glucose of people who don’t have regulation issues still fluctuates across the day, going up and down depending on what we eat, physical activity level, as well as things such as whether we’re ill or going through puberty, Willer says. “For people who don’t have diabetes, that fluctuation will occur within a tighter range, while for people who do have diabetes, their blood glucose levels stray outside of what we would call the reference range.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-cgms-do" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What do CGMs do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People with diabetes previously had to use a finger prick test to measure their blood glucose levels. The CGM is a relatively new device that &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/continuous-glucose-monitors-cgms-for-type-2-diabetes-when-and-for-whom-are-they-useful" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;uses a sensor to measure glucose via the fluid between cells every few minutes&lt;/a&gt; and then sends the reading to a receiver or smartphone app. For people with diabetes, the reading can then help them manage their glucose levels by influencing how they eat or using some glucose-modifying drugs such as insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Clinical endocrinologist Prof Jenny Gunton says CGMs can “hugely improve the quality of life” for people living with type 1 diabetes, as well as pregnant women who have gestational diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes on insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-people-who-dont-have-diabetes" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What about people who don’t have diabetes?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Gunton, who heads the Centre for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/diabetes" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, Obesity and Endocrinology Research at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research, says outside of these groups, wearing a CGM can be useful to understand blood glucose levels after various foods and exercise, but warns that “like any device that gives lots of information, CGMs can sometimes increase anxiety and stress”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They are also expensive. For people who aren’t eligible for a government subsidy, it can cost more than $100 for a sensor that lasts just 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="should-people-without-diabetes-use-them" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;Should people without diabetes use them?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A study led by the University of the Sunshine Coast in 2022 found CGMs &lt;a href="https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijsnem/33/2/article-p121.xml" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;provide little benefit for healthy athletes without diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Separately, researchers who &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dme.15369" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;analysed the available evidence&lt;/a&gt; of the utility of CMGs among people not living with diabetes in 2024 said that due to the lack of evidence, “we urge for the commercial claims suggesting the utility of the device in [this population] to be labelled as misleading”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="32647e94-ea2b-4d80-8168-eb3615d3e3a3" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":17,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"What is hair and scalp oiling, and will it make my locks long like Rapunzel? | Antiviral","elementId":"32647e94-ea2b-4d80-8168-eb3615d3e3a3","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/09/hair-oiling-scalp-what-is-it-good-for-hair-benefits-fact-check"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":8,"display":0,"theme":1}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Willer welcomes people trying to understand how their body works, but says any idea of a “magic number” for glucose levels for someone who doesn’t have insulin resistance or diabetes is “completely imaginary”. She also says it could lead people to becoming unnecessarily restrictive with their diet and trying to control their body in a way that is not necessarily healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s a bit like calorie counting, in that it’s one metric that can give people the impression that it kind of wraps everything up together, that it is an indicator for everything. But just like calorie counting, it is actually hugely reductionistic, and it means that we lose so much context about why we eat, when we eat, the sorts of things we eat, and how food functions in our social and cultural experiences as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Willer recommends for people who are interested in living a healthier lifestyle and want an individual approach to speak to a health expert rather than buy a product online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Even if they have purchased a CGM, a dietitian or another health professional will help understand, to help them interpret what’s going on with their numbers against their actual behaviours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span data-dcr-style="bullet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span data-dcr-style="bullet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/antiviral" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Antiviral&lt;/a&gt; is a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claims&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="19b58638-5ce7-4089-89d7-fa8753b97765" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutBlockElementV2" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="CalloutBlockComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"callout":{"description":"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;What health trend&amp;amp;nbsp;do you want examined?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","prompt":"Share your experience","displayOnSensitive":true,"elementId":"19b58638-5ce7-4089-89d7-fa8753b97765","title":"Share your experience","isNonCollapsible":false,"formFields":[{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_is_your_namepseudonym","id":"172730135","hideLabel":false,"label":"What is your name/pseudonym?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_news_story_or_health_information_being_shared_on_social_media_have_you_seen_that_youd_like_us_to_examine","id":"172730137","hideLabel":false,"label":"What news story or health information being shared on social media have you seen that you’d like us to examine","hidden":false,"type":"textarea","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"do_you_have_a_link_to_an_example_you_can_share","id":"173258657","hideLabel":false,"label":"Do you have a link to an example you can share?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldRadio","name":"can_we_publish_your_response","options":[{"label":"Yes, entirely","value":"Yes, entirely"},{"label":"Yes, but contact me first","value":"Yes, but contact me first"},{"label":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous","value":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous"},{"label":"No, this is information only","value":"No, this is information only"}],"id":"172730143","hideLabel":false,"label":"Can we publish your response?","hidden":false,"type":"radio","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"email_address","description":"Your contact details are helpful so we can contact you for more information.

the most complete whole protein-based food,” she explained. “I always encourage whole foods first.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Carnahan advised people to focus on foods “in their whole state,” which include apples, bananas, carrot sticks, nuts and seeds, natural peanut butter, and plain Greek yogurt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These are all great foods that just take a little planning and are easy to consume with little preparation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data shows that more than half of daily calories in the UK and the US come from

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;cientists recently discovered a microbe with one of the tiniest genomes on Earth. More surprising, the creature is almost entirely dependent on its host: Its genes don’t support any of the functions of metabolism, one of the key processes of life. As such, it challenges fundamental notions of what it means to be a living organism.&lt;/p&gt;
      
    &lt;p&gt;The discovery was “pure serendipity,” says Takuro Nakayama, an evolutionary microbiologist at the University of Tsukuba in Japan. Takayama wanted to study the many microbes that live within a single-celled marine dinoflagellate, &lt;em&gt;Citharistes regius&lt;/em&gt;, a kind of plankton. But when he and his colleagues sequenced the genes of this microbial community, they kept turning up tiny, odd chunks of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that these DNA chunks belong to some unusual archaea—a branch on the tree of life populated by single-celled microbes that can often survive in extreme environments. (Archaea are similar to bacteria, but distinct in their structure, genetics, and metabolism.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did Sukunaarchaeum end up with such a strikingly tiny genome?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nakayama and his colleagues proposed the name Sukunaarchaeum mirabile for the newly-discovered microbe: Sukunaarchaeum after the Japanese dwarf deity &lt;em&gt;Sukuna-biko-na&lt;/em&gt;, and mirabile for marvelous. At only 238,000 base pairs, the number of genes in the DNA of Sukunaarchaeum is smaller than that of any other known archaea. The scientists described &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.02.651781v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;their finding&lt;/a&gt; in a bioRxiv preprint earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how did Sukunaarchaeum end up with such a strikingly tiny genome? Over the course of evolution, genetic instructions for life often become increasingly complex. But evolution can also go in the other direction, leading to greater simplicity in the genome. This so-called genomic reduction, where organisms end up with fewer genes than their ancestors, is typically observed in the domains of bacteria and archaea. What struck Nakayama and his colleagues about Sukunaarchaeum was the extent of reduction and specialization in its genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its stripped down genome, Sukunaarchaeum appears to be completely dependent on its host, &lt;em&gt;C. regius&lt;/em&gt;, for essential energy and nutrients. “It likely cannot produce its own cellular building blocks,” notes Nakayama. “No previously discovered microbe has shown such an extreme degree of metabolic dependence.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sukunaarchaeum seems to almost inhabit a new category of life, suspended somewhere between archaea and virus. It is like viruses—which aren’t typically considered to be “alive”—in that it has a tiny genome and is totally dependent on its host for metabolism. But unlike a virus, Sukunaarchaeum has its own ribosomes, cellular structures that synthesize proteins, and it can replicate itself without the help of a host.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a sense of just how unusual Sukunaarchaeum is, the researchers decided to scan the oceans for potential relatives. They analyzed environmental genetic sequence data from marine environments all over the world, focusing on spots where &lt;em&gt;C. regius&lt;/em&gt; is known to live. Using a database called the Tara Oceans project, they discovered a vast array of sequences that are comparable to that of Sukunaarchaeum, which they hypothesize could represent a new, deeply branching archaeal lineage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Nakayama, this additional finding suggests that many more microbes that challenge the definition of life may be out there, living in what Nakayama calls “microbial dark matter,” or microbes that can’t be cultivated in the lab. “The extreme, virus-like lifestyle we hypothesize for Sukunaarchaeum is a perfect example of the surprising outcomes found in this ‘natural laboratory of evolution,’” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mart Krupovic, a virologist and microbiologist at Institut Pasteur in France who wasn’t involved in the study, called the finding “remarkable.” Krupovic has studied giant viruses that, like Sukunaarchaeum, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4161/cib.18624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;defy categorization&lt;/a&gt;. These giant viruses have evolved larger and more complex genomes that include some of the genes for DNA translation, a characteristic thought to be reserved for cellular life. “I think that is fascinating,” says Krupovic, “how little we still know about the world which surrounds us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, Nakayama wants to culture and isolate Sukunaarchaeum in the lab, not just its genes, and take an image or video of it. He hopes this will help him better understand its biology, ecology, and how it is built—how it achieves this curious feat of living on the edge of life. &lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-13765" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;BELOIT, Wis. -- The Wisconsin Department of Health Services on Tuesday identified two public locations where people might have been exposed to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two locations were the Pilot Travel Center #289 at 3001 Milwaukee Road in Beloit and the Flying J Travel Center #470 at 1191 70th Ave. in Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exposure at the Roberts location may have happened between 7:15 a.m. and 10 a.m. on Aug. 4 and the exposure at the Beloit location may have occurred between 11:45 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. on Aug. 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were at one of the locations during the date and times identified, check your immunization status as soon as possible to ensure you have received an MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DHS said the exposure is from an out-of-state traveler who visited Wisconsin.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This study links the MIND diet to less neuron loss in the hippocampus, which is key to memory and learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participants who followed the MIND diet closely had a 22% lower chance of hippocampal sclerosis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These findings build on evidence that food choices may influence brain aging and dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Everyone wants to protect their memories. The idea of forgetting familiar faces or treasured moments drives many people to look for ways to protect their brain health. That motivation has fueled growing interest in lifestyle habits—especially diet—that could help keep the mind sharp.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One part of the brain researchers are particularly focused on is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-to-improve-your-memory-8415078" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;, a hub for learning and memory. When it sustains damage in the form of hippocampal sclerosis (a severe loss of neurons in this region) it’s often linked to dementia. These cells don’t grow back.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study, published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, offers intriguing evidence that what you eat may influence the odds of developing this type of brain damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It examined &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mind-diet-dementia-study-11748383" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;, an eating pattern built to support cognitive health, and found that people who followed it more closely were less likely to lose neurons in their hippocampus. It’s a new piece in the larger puzzle of how diet may help preserve brain function with age.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers analyzed data from 809 participants in the long-running Rush Memory and Aging Project, all of whom had agreed to donate their brains for research after death. None had dementia when they joined the study, and they completed annual food questionnaires for up to 18 years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Using these detailed diet records, scientists calculated a MIND diet score for each person, with higher scores reflecting closer adherence to the diet. After death, brain tissue was examined for signs of hippocampal sclerosis, hippocampal sclerosis with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE-NC), and general hippocampal neuronal loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The participants had an average age of 91 at death, and most were white.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Those with the highest MIND diet scores had about a 22% lower chance of having hippocampal sclerosis compared to those with the lowest scores. They were also less likely to have hippocampal sclerosis alongside limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE-NC) and had less overall neuronal loss in the hippocampus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The link held even after accounting for age, sex, education, total calorie intake, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893378/these-13-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-alzheimers-according-to-a-new-study/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, Alzheimer’s pathology and vascular disease in the brain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study also found that hippocampal sclerosis explained about 21% of the connection between the MIND diet and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-habits-dementia-study-11695904" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower odds of dementia&lt;/a&gt; at the time of death.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, the authors note important limitations: the study was observational, so it cannot prove the diet prevented brain damage. Other factors not measured could play a role. And because the participants were almost entirely non-Hispanic white older adults, the findings may not apply to all populations.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even though this study can’t prove that the MIND diet directly prevents neuron loss, it builds on earlier research showing the diet’s link to slower cognitive decline and a lower risk of dementia. Taken together, the evidence paints a consistent picture: your daily food choices may play a meaningful role in how well your brain ages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s about tipping the balance toward foods known to nourish the brain. That means: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eating &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-vegetable-for-better-gut-health-11717168" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;leafy greens&lt;/a&gt; most days of the week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Including berries a few times per week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choosing nuts, beans, whole grains and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-olive-oil-good-for-you-8766002" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;olive oil regularly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eating fish and poultry more often than red meat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limiting foods like butter, full-fat cheese, pastries, sweets, fried food and fast food&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If that sounds like a big leap from where you are now, start small. Picture your week of meals and identify one easy win: maybe swapping your usual side of fries for a green salad a couple of times, or tossing a handful of walnuts into your afternoon yogurt. Keep &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8062002/blueberry-recipes-to-make-forever/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a carton of blueberries&lt;/a&gt; in the fridge—or a bag in the freezer—so you can grab a brain-friendly snack without thinking twice. If you cook with butter by habit, try drizzling olive oil over vegetables instead and notice how quickly the swap becomes second nature.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're ready for a bigger overhaul, trying something like our weeklong &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-7-day-cognitive-health-meal-plan-11685540" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cognitive Health Meal Plan&lt;/a&gt; could be a great next step. We also love MIND diet recipes like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chicken-spinach-salad-with-creamy-feta-dressing-8417420" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chicken &amp;amp; Spinach Salad with Creamy Feta Dressing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lemon-garlic-chicken-casserole-8363311" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Lemon-Garlic Chicken Casserole&lt;/a&gt;, since they include big flavor, plenty of veggies and some whole grains, too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And these changes aren’t just good for your hippocampus. They may also improve heart health, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-avoid-for-chronic-inflammation-8644317" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and help you feel more energetic day to day—benefits you can notice long before any memory test. The beauty of the MIND diet is that you don’t have to overhaul your entire plate at once; you just have to start leaning, meal by meal, in the right direction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is the first human study to show that following the MIND diet is linked with a lower likelihood of hippocampal sclerosis, a type of neuron loss tied to dementia. While it can’t prove the diet directly prevents brain cell loss, it adds to a growing body of evidence that what you eat matters for brain health. Focusing on plant-rich meals, healthy fats, and limiting processed foods may be one step toward protecting your memory in the years ahead.&lt;br&gt;

Kennedy Jr. speaks as he attends a press conference with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz to discuss health insurance reform, at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 23, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Kevin Mohatt | Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Healthy Returns newsletter, which brings the latest health-care news straight to your inbox. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/healthy-returns-newsletter/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to receive future editions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/rfk-jr-cdc-panel-vaccines.html"&gt;gutted a key government vaccine panel&lt;/a&gt;, saying it was necessary to eliminate what he called "persistent conflicts of interest" on the committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2837784" target="_blank"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; from the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy &amp;amp; Economics appears to challenge that argument. Conflicts on that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel had been at "historic lows for years" before Kennedy restacked it with new members, some of whom are widely known vaccine critics, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the medical journal JAMA on Monday, also found that the type of conflict considered to be the "most concerning" – income from vaccine makers – had been virtually eliminated among members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conflicts of interest rates were also low on a separate panel of advisors to the Food and Drug Administration called the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC, according to the research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups are crucial to shaping U.S. vaccine policy: While the FDA committee advises the agency on whether to approve shots, the CDC panel determines who is eligible for jabs and whether insurers should cover them. The panels are typically made up of top experts in infectious diseases, pediatrics, immunology and public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has long contended that the advisors on those panels have close ties to the pharmaceutical industry. At his first Senate confirmation hearing in January, Kennedy claimed that 97% of the CDC panel members had conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before he was confirmed, I saw this 97% number and thought, wow, that's some serious stuff. But after looking at the vaccine data myself, I certainly couldn't see anything at that scale," said the study's lead author Genevieve Kanter, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Southern California, in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it will be reassuring to the public and to the [Trump] administration that issues that we thought were pretty serious or in the past were serious are not anymore," she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research comes as Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic himself, overhauls federal health agencies and pursues efforts that could change immunization policy and undermine vaccine uptake in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USC researchers analyzed reported financial conflicts of interest among experts on the two vaccine panels between 2000 and 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how conflicts of interest disclosures work on the panels, which meet several times a year to review vaccines: For each product being discussed, members must say if they have a tie to the vaccine maker or a competitor and disclose the nature of the relationship. People on the panel with conflicts either receive a waiver to participate if they are deemed to provide essential expertise, while those with conflicts considered too significant are recused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, an average of 6.2% of ACIP members and 1.9% of VRBPAC members have reported a financial conflict of interest at any given meeting, according to the paper. During that period, less than 1% of reported conflicts on both panels were tied to personal income from vaccine makers, including consulting fees, stock, royalties or ownership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates of reported conflicts among ACIP members fell to 5% by 2024, and stayed below 4% among VRBPAC members since 2010, including 10 years where there were no reported conflicts at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conflict of interest rates were significantly higher in the early 2000s, peaking at around 43% for ACIP in 2000 and 27% for VRBPAC in 2007, the researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study said the decline over the years may be due to policy changes in 2007 that cracked down on conflicts of interest on the FDA panel, and "greater awareness and scrutiny" of conflicts in agency decision-making. It's not clear when exactly the CDC committee began to do the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the study period, the most frequently reported conflict of interest was research support, which is generally considered less of a concern than financial ties associated with personal income. Kanter said that's a reflection of the panel members' areas of expertise that are relevant to evaluating the safety, efficacy and applicability of shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The dominant conflicts were grant support for research. In a way that makes sense because, who do we want on these committees? It's people with expertise on how to conduct research on these vaccines," Kanter said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These conflicts are not about personal gain, but related to measures of expertise." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some of the rates appear to be higher with ACIP members than with people on the VRBPAC panel, Kanter said it is not comparable because the CDC provides "far less granular" data on conflicts of interest. She added that the FDA panel typically reviews one product at a time during a meeting, while the CDC committee evaluates multiple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kanter said it is important to examine conflicts of interest and the influence of the pharmaceutical industry in many aspects of health-care regulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she added that "if we do want to focus on conflicts of interest, there may be other areas where the prevalence is a greater concern than what we've seen here with these vaccine panels." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at &lt;a href="http://nbcuni.com/?__source=newsletter%7Chealthyreturns" target="_blank"&gt;annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Latest in health care: UnitedHealth's Buffett bounce holds for now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett was just what the doctor ordered to stabilize &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-5"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/UNH/"&gt;UnitedHealth Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filing revealing a new stake of more than 5 million shares has helped lift the stock back above $300 — a far cry from the 52-week low of under $235 that it hit earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks Berkshire's first foray into the complicated area of managed care.

I'm attending Epic's annual &lt;a href="https://www.ugm.epic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Users Group Meeting&lt;/a&gt;, where thousands of health-care executives flock to the company's 1,670-acre headquarters to learn about the company's latest products and features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epic is a health-care software company best known for its electronic health record, or EHR software. An EHR is a digital version of a patient's medical record that's maintained by doctors and nurses over time. Epic is the dominant EHR vendor in the U.S., and its technology is used in 3,300 hospitals and 73,000 clinics and by 325 million patients around the globe, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence was front and center at UGM this year, much like it was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/21/epic-systems-ugm-2024-ai-tools-in-mychart-cosmos-.html"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. During a three-hour-long executive address Tuesday morning, Epic executives shared updates about the roughly 200 new AI features it's been developing for patients, clinicians and payers. Keep an eye out for additional coverage from CNBC that explains some of these upcoming features in more detail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epic confirmed that it is developing its own AI-powered clinical documentation tool, which was one of the most anticipated announcements of this year's event. These tools, which are often called AI scribes, are able to draft clinical notes in real time as doctors consensually record their visits with patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fiercely competitive AI scribing market has taken off as health-care executives search for solutions to help reduce staff burnout and daunting administrative workloads. Some AI scribing startups like Abridge and Ambience Healthcare have raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors, and there was a lot of speculation about whether Epic would ultimately join the fray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it is working on this feature in partnership with Microsoft, and that it will be available for limited use early next year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AI is here, it's accelerating, you can't wish it away, you've got to keep up with it," Epic's President Sumit Rana said during the address. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presentations took place in Epic's 11,400-seat underground auditorium called Deep Space, which is just one of the many &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/01/inside-epic-systems-mythical-campus-a-world-away-from-wall-street-.html"&gt;unique facilities&lt;/a&gt; on campus. Epic's office buildings are themed, with many inspired by science fiction and stories like "The Wizard of Oz," the Harry Potter series and "Alice in Wonderland." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UGM meetings are also themed, and Epic executives famously take the stage dressed in costume. This year's theme was "sci-fi," and Epic's 82-year-old founder and CEO Judy Faulkner wore a purple wig, bright green shoes and a metallic vest that appeared inspired by the fictional character, Buzz Lightyear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNBC had the opportunity to sit down with Faulkner earlier this summer in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/16/how-epics-82-year-old-ceo-judy-faulkner-built-her-software-factory.html"&gt;rare interview,&lt;/a&gt; where she reflected on her 46 years at the company's helm. During her presentation on Tuesday, Faulkner discussed Epic's AI initiatives and roadmap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are combining the intelligence and curiosity of the human being with the investigative capabilities of gen AI," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the new features Epic teased on Tuesday are still several months, or over a year, away. But it's clear that Epic is leaning in on AI, and they didn't let this year's UGM attendees forget it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about CNBC's interview with Faulkner &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/16/how-epics-82-year-old-ceo-judy-faulkner-built-her-software-factory.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Ashley at &lt;a href="mailto:ashley.capoot@nbcuni.com." target="_blank"&gt;ashley.capoot@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 20:03:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>科学家测试不使用激光治疗眼球的新型LASIK样系统-未来主义</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE9Xd0FUS1ZIeEVSRS1zOXU5bmZuTXNQUFRlbGEzWENzMTFqNnhDWml3VHBjN1B4VWE2aF9jSUh1ZEhDSEdGcHI4d0FEX3h0ZWwySmZnT0Nha2JwejJFd1Y1akFuTnZLTUJFM1ZiMkFB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content z-50 w-full p-3 space-y-4 bg-white border lg:-mt-6 md:p-4 md:border-gray-900 lg:ml-3 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;div class="space-y-4 lg:space-y-0"&gt;&lt;p class="block text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase lg:hidden font-c"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Image by Valeria Blanc / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have come up with a potentially groundbreaking — and entirely laser-free — alternative to LASIK, a popular surgical procedure that uses high-power lasers to reshape the cornea to correct vision problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a meeting of the American Chemical Society, a team of scientists led by Occidental College chemistry professor Michael Hill showed off a new approach, called "electromechanical reshaping" (EMR), that uses small jolts of electricity and a molded platinum "contact lens" to reshape the cornea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we're still many years away from being able to tell if the new technique will be a viable alternative to LASIK, there are reasons to be optimistic. LASIK surgery, which has been around for decades, can have rare but negative side effects including dry eyes or — in extreme cases — vision loss or infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMR could greatly simplify the process without relying on invasive surgery, the scientists say, and potentially lower costs as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The whole effect was discovered by accident," said team member and University of California, Irvine, professor Brian Wong in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-08-alternative-lasik-lasers.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "I was looking at living tissues as moldable materials and discovered this whole process of chemical modification."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that adjusting the pH of collagen-containing tissues in the body, such as corneas, allows them to become temporarily malleable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hill and his colleagues &lt;a href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/PC11941/PC1194107/Exploration-of-electromechanical-reshaping-of-rabbit-cornea/10.1117/12.2610383.short" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;previously demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; that EMR can be used to alter the shape of rabbit ears, for example, and even scar tissues in pigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments involving rabbits, the team used a platinum "contact lens" in the shape of a corrected cornea as a way to generate precise pH changes in the animal's tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly a minute later, around the time it takes to perform LASIK, the rabbit's cornea conformed to the contact lens — but with fewer steps and no incisions, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team successfully improved the shape of eyeballs, which were treated as if they had myopia, or nearsightedness, in ten out of 12 rabbit eyeballs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team suggests the new technique could reverse common reasons why patients choose to undergo LASIK, including nearsightedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could even reverse chemical-caused cloudiness, which conventionally can only be treated through a complete corneal transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite promising results — for all but two bunnies, at least — we're still many years away from determining if EMR can become a viable alternative to LASIK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the statement, Wong explained that he and his colleagues are gearing up for a "long march through animal studies that are detailed and precise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is also struggling with finding the required scientific funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a long road between what we've done and the clinic," said Hill in the statement.

              &lt;p&gt;Some of the most physically fit people in the world may have a unique health risk. New research uncovers a possible link between marathon running and colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oncologists at the Inova Schar Cancer Institute in Virginia conducted the study, which examined the colons of relatively young people who had run several long-distance races. They found these runners had a much higher rate of having potentially dangerous adenomas (a type of polyp) than would be expected for their age. Though the findings are preliminary and require more confirmation, they may point to a real connection between colorectal cancer and extreme physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It tells us there’s a signal here,” David Lieberman, a gastroenterologist and professor emeritus at Oregon Health and Science University not affiliated with the study, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the New York Times Tuesday. “We wouldn’t have expected these rates of high-risk adenomas, which are cancer precursor lesions, in an age group like this.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A mysterious trend&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Timothy Cannon was inspired to perform the study after he treated three young patients with colorectal cancer, all of whom had run ultramarathons (defined as any race longer than 26.2 miles). Not only were his patients fit, but they were also much younger than the typical case, the oldest being 40.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In 2022, Cannon and his colleagues &lt;a href="https://www.inovanewsroom.org/expert-commentary/2022/10/endurance-sports-and-colorectal-cancer-is-there-a-connection/"&gt;began&lt;/a&gt; recruiting endurance athletes for their prospective study. The volunteers had all run at least two ultramarathons or five regular marathons; they also had no family history of colorectal cancer or other apparent risk factors. All told, 100 athletes between the ages of 35 and 50 took part and were given colonoscopies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers went looking for advanced adenomas in the colons of their volunteers, relatively large or otherwise unusual polyps. Though these growths are themselves benign, they have a higher risk of turning cancerous than other polyps. Then they compared the rate of finding these polyps in their athletes to historical trends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 1.2% of people in their 40s at average risk for colorectal cancer would be expected to have advanced adenomas, according to the researchers. By sharp contrast, 15% of the runners they studied had them, while nearly half had polyps in general.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Consideration of refined screening strategies for this population is warranted,” the researchers wrote in their study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Much left to understand&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team &lt;a href="https://www.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/ABSTRACT491966"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; its results earlier this year at the annual conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. That means this study hasn’t yet undergone the formal peer-review process. The authors are also quick to note their work isn’t definitive proof that endurance running can cause colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Assuming this link is causative, there remains the burning question of why. As even weekend 5k joggers will know, running can occasionally trigger bouts of gastrointestinal distress (the namesake &lt;a href="https://sportsmedicine.mayoclinic.org/news/how-can-i-prevent-runners-diarrhea/"&gt;runner’s diarrhea&lt;/a&gt;). These injuries are sometimes caused by temporarily restricted blood flow to the intestines that damages nearby cells. It’s possible, the researchers speculate, that extreme runners who regularly experience this blood flow loss can develop the sort of chronic inflammation that makes cancer more likely to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, though, that’s only one hypothesis for what may be happening here. The researchers say future studies should try to confirm their findings as well as untangle the causes and risk factors that could explain this potential higher risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All that said, this research shouldn’t scare anyone away from running or any other form of cardio. The many health benefits of regular physical activity—which importantly include a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/health-benefits/lowers-risk-of-cancer.html"&gt;lower risk&lt;/a&gt; of at least eight different types of cancer—still far outweigh the risks for the average person.&lt;/p&gt;
              
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The 2025 updates represent a new accumulation of evidence that gives people better opportunities for longer and healthier lives,” said &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/file/daniel-w288890" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Daniel W.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;For people with high blood pressure, here are six main takeaways from the new guidelines:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-get-on-medications-sooner"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Get on Medications Sooner &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The new guidelines advise doctors to prescribe &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-lower-blood-pressure-5204833" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;medications for patients with high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; sooner, especially if three to six months of lifestyle changes don’t bring down their numbers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A key reason for quick action, Jones said, is that new research has confirmed that high blood pressure is also a factor in cognitive decline. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But even if you start taking blood pressure medications, your doctor will still encourage healthy habits like regular exercise and a balanced diet, said &lt;a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/jerome-scott/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Scott Jerome, MD&lt;/a&gt;, director of Ambulatory Services and Outreach for Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-lower-your-salt-intake-even-further"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Lower Your Salt Intake Even Further &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like the old guidelines, the update still calls for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-much-sodium-per-day-11729822" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;limiting sodium to less than 2,300 mg per day&lt;/a&gt; (about one teaspoon of salt) and working toward a goal of no more than 1,500 mg per day.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The AHA advises checking food labels because U.S. adults get most of their sodium from packaged and restaurant foods. Many restaurant chains also list sodium content online, and at dine-in restaurants, you can ask if they can limit salt or serve sauces on the side. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When cooking at home, try salt substitutes with potassium and add more &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-high-in-potassium-8414111" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potassium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; like bananas, spinach, mushrooms, and honeydew melon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-try-to-quit-or-limit-alcohol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Try to Quit or Limit Alcohol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The new guidelines advise &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-happens-when-you-quit-alcohol-for-a-month-8425698" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;abstaining from alcohol&lt;/a&gt;. For those who do drink, the advice is to have no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 2023 review of seven studies in &lt;em&gt;Hypertension &lt;/em&gt;found that every additional &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/alcohol-and-blood-pressure-11755471" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;alcoholic beverage may increase blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; over the years, even in people without high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The 2025 guidelines continue to advise healthy eating, especially &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/dash-diet-7487469" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on less salt and more produce, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, low—or no-fat dairy, poultry, and fish.

Covid-19 vaccine. Previously, the CDC advised vaccination for everyone six months and older with the latest available dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC currently advises that Covid-19 vaccinations for children aged six months through 17 years should be determined through “shared clinical decision-making”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The AAP recommends vaccination for anyone under 18 who is at higher risk of serious illness from Covid-19, resides in a longterm care or congregate living facility, has not previously been vaccinated, or shares a household with someone at elevated risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The academy has been making pediatric immunization recommendations since the 1930s, that has not changed,” Dr Susan Kressly, president of the AAP, told &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/leading-pediatrician-group-recommends-covid-vaccine-infants-toddlers/story?id=124756899" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“But what has changed is that this year, we’re doing it in the environment of misinformation, which makes it more important than ever that we provide clear and confident guidance, because the majority of American families really depend on us for this guidance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;AAP says infants and toddlers between six and 23 months face the greatest risk for severe outcomes from Covid-19 and vaccination offers protection against serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even as medical groups continue to disagree with federal agencies, insurers often &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/acip-cdc-and-insurance-coverage-of-vaccines-in-the-united-states/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;base coverage&lt;/a&gt; on guidelines from the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP). If ACIP declines to endorse a vaccine, families may have to pay out of pocket, and the shot may not be provided through the federally funded Vaccines for Children program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The US Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Human Services (HHS) communications director, Andrew Nixon, responded to the AAP’s updated recommendations with the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The American people deserve confidence that medical recommendations are based solely on science and public health. We call on the AAP to strengthen conflict-of-interest safeguards and keep its publications free from financial influence, ensuring every recommendation reflects only the best interests of America’s children. Instead, the AAP is undermining national immunization policymaking with baseless political attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The statement continues: “Secretary Kennedy has stood firm in his commitment to science, transparency, and restoring public trust.

&lt;p id="8d1a2f3f-63ef-4092-9cc9-69130d3f3599"&gt;Dental treatments from sheep’s wool and other hair could be used to coat teeth to repair enamel and prevent tooth decay, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After extracting keratin — a protein found in hair, skin and fingernails — from wool and applying it to teeth, scientists found that the substance formed a protective crystal-like coating that mimicked natural tooth enamel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="8d1a2f3f-63ef-4092-9cc9-69130d3f3599-2"&gt;The finding could support sustainable, low-cost treatments for early tooth decay within the next two to three years, according to the researchers.They reported their findings August 12 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202502465" target="_blank" data-url="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202502465" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Advanced Healthcare Materials&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="934397ad-c8ad-4e7d-92ec-58b3f48f4d6e"&gt;"Keratin offers a transformative alternative to current dental treatments," study coauthor&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/sara-gamea" target="_blank" data-url="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/sara-gamea" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Sara Gamea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a dentistry researcher at King's College London, said in the statement. "Not only is it sustainably sourced from biological waste materials like hair and skin, it also eliminates the need for traditional plastic resins, commonly used in restorative dentistry, which are toxic and less durable. Keratin also looks much more natural than these treatments, as it can more closely match the color of the original tooth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untreated tooth decay is the world's &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/oral-health" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/oral-health" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most common oral health condition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, affecting some 2 billion people worldwide. Over time, acidic foods, poor oral hygiene, and everyday wear and tear can break down the protective enamel that covers a person's teeth. Losing that enamel can lead to pain, cavities and tooth loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unlike bones and hair, enamel does not regenerate," study coauthor&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/sherif-elsharkawy" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/sherif-elsharkawy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Sherif Elsharkawy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher specializing in prosthodontics at King's College London, said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1094554" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1094554" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Then they mixed the keratin with water, where it formed a thin film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After applying the keratin film to a tooth sample, the scientists found that it formed an ordered, strong and crystal-like coating similar to biological enamel when it came in contact with minerals in saliva. Over the course of a month, the coating attracted calcium and phosphate ions, building up a hard, protective layer over the tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f2228bdb-e927-4ab7-ab51-b87250ac2faf"&gt;The scientists are exploring ways to bring the keratin treatment to the public. Keratin toothpastes for daily use or professional coatings applied at a dentist's office could be available within the next few years, according to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are entering an exciting era where biotechnology allows us to not just treat symptoms but restore biological function using the body's own materials," Elsharkawy said. "With further development and the right industry partnerships, we may soon be growing stronger, healthier smiles from something as simple as a haircut."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting off blood flow can prematurely age the bone marrow, weakening the immune system's ability to fight cancer, according to a new study from NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Published online in &lt;i&gt;JACC-CardioOncology,&lt;/i&gt; the study showed that peripheral ischemia–restricted blood flow in the arteries in the legs–caused &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/breast+tumors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;breast tumors&lt;/a&gt; in mice to grow at double the rate seen in mice without restricted flow. These findings build on a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-07-breast-cancer-deadlier-heart-survivors.html"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; by the same team that found ischemia during a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+attack/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; to have the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemia occurs when fatty deposits, such as cholesterol, accumulate in artery walls, leading to inflammation and clotting that restrict the flow of oxygen-rich blood. When this happens in the legs, it causes peripheral artery disease, which affects millions of Americans, and can increase the risk of heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study shows that impaired blood flow drives cancer growth regardless of where it happens in the body," says corresponding author Kathryn J. Moore, Ph.D., the Jean and David Blechman Professor of Cardiology in the Department of Medicine, Leon H. Charney Division of Cardiology, NYU Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This link between peripheral artery disease and breast cancer growth underscores the critical importance of addressing metabolic and vascular risk factors as part of a comprehensive cancer treatment strategy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the research team found that restricted blood flow triggers a shift toward immune cell populations that cannot efficiently fight infections and cancer, mirroring changes seen with aging.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Systemic skewing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the mechanisms behind the link between &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cardiovascular+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; and cancer growth, the study authors developed a mouse model with breast tumors and induced temporary ischemia in one hind limb. The team then compared cancer growth in mice with and without impaired blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings build on the nature of the immune system, which evolved to attack invading bacteria and viruses, and, under normal conditions, to detect and eliminate &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;. These protective functions rely on stem cell reserves in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bone+marrow/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bone marrow&lt;/a&gt;, which can be activated as needed to produce key white blood cell populations throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the immune system responds to injury or infection by ramping up inflammation to eliminate threats, then scaling back to avoid harm to healthy tissue. This balance is maintained by a mix of immune cells that either activate or suppress inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that reduced &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+flow/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood flow&lt;/a&gt; disrupts this equilibrium. It reprograms stem cells in the bone marrow to favor the production of "myeloid" immune cells (monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils) that dampen immune responses, while reducing output of lymphocytes like T cells that help to mount strong anti-tumor responses.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;The local environment within tumors showed a similar shift, accumulating more immune-suppressive cells– including Ly6Chi monocytes, M2-like F4/80+ MHCIIlo macrophages, and regulatory T cells—that shield cancer from immune attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experiments showed that these immune changes were long-lasting. Ischemia not only altered the expression of hundreds of genes, shifting immune cells into a more cancer-tolerant state, but also reorganized the structure of chromatin–the protein scaffolding that controls access to DNA–making it harder for immune cells to activate genes involved in fighting cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results reveal a direct mechanism by which ischemia drives cancer growth, reprogramming &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stem+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; in ways that resemble aging and promote immune tolerance," says first author Alexandra Newman, Ph.D., a postdoctoral scholar in Dr. Moore's lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings open the door to new strategies in cancer prevention and treatment, like earlier cancer screening for patients with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/peripheral+artery+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;peripheral artery disease&lt;/a&gt; and using inflammation-modulating therapies to counter these effects."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the research team hopes to help design clinical studies that evaluate whether existing inflammation-targeted therapies can counter post-ischemic changes driving tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;

            We all know that influenza is a common and serious viral infection, but it’s good to be reminded ahead of the upcoming flu season, which typically starts in October.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimiand000e3b6n6x338ked@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were an estimated 47 million to 82 million flu illnesses in the United States between October 2024 and May 2025, resulting in between 610,000 and 1.3 million hospitalizations, according to preliminary estimated ranges from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Most fatalities occur in older individuals, but children can also die from the flu. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/children.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; that flu-related deaths in children have generally ranged from 37 to 199 deaths each flu season.

            Now, a new study in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2836871?guestAccessKey=cf976c38-c219-4f1e-968a-5728eafd28e6&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=073025&amp;amp;utm_source=BulletinHealthCare&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=073125&amp;amp;utm_content=NON-MEMBER&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_alert-morning_rounds_daily&amp;amp;utm_uid=3402323&amp;amp;utm_effort=DAMR01" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt; has examined a rare but severe complication that can occur in children who contract the flu. This complication, called acute necrotizing encephalopathy, or ANE, carries a mortality rate of 27%  despite intensive care and treatment, according to the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimiand000h3b6n48962y7h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I wanted to learn more about complications associated with the flu, specifically about ANE, what researchers learned about children with ANE, and how can ANE be prevented. And what should parents and families know ahead of the next flu season?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimiand000i3b6nmvksvqp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimb0gc00003b6nafep23lj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What are complications associated with the flu? Who is most at risk?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b2000n3b6nftdr5rix@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Most people who have the flu will recover without complications. They may go through days or even weeks having fever, runny nose, headache and fatigue, but these symptoms generally resolve without long-term consequences.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b3000o3b6n17zwjdsy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people, though, experience &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/children.html" target="_blank"&gt;complications&lt;/a&gt; that could result in severe illness or even death. These complications include pneumonia, sinus and ear infections, brain and neurological conditions, and the worsening of existing medical problems such as heart and kidney disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b3000p3b6n8pzucpdz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People at higher risk for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;flu complications&lt;/a&gt; include individuals 65 years and older, children younger than 2 and pregnant women. In addition, there are a variety of chronic medical conditions that increase risk, including chronic lung disease, diabetes, heart disease, liver disorders, kidney dysfunction and any condition that makes you immunocompromised.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What exactly is ANE, and how common is it?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b3000r3b6nw2w7lero@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ﻿&lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;ANE is a &lt;a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions/acute-necrotizing-encephalopathy#:~:text=Acute%20necrotizing%20encephalopathy%20(ANE)%20is,often%20influenza%20(the%20flu)." target="_blank"&gt;rare but very serious condition&lt;/a&gt; that occurs as a result of influenza infection. It causes inflammation and swelling in the brain, and it &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6636323/#:~:text=Acute%20necrotizing%20encephalopathy%20(ANE)%20of,noted%20on%20neuroimaging%20%5B4%5D." target="_blank"&gt;can lead to&lt;/a&gt; seizures, impaired consciousness, coma, long-term brain damage and death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b3000s3b6n0j1ump97@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not known precisely how common this condition is or whether the incidence has been changing in recent years. It can also occur after other viral illnesses, but it has been most closely associated with influenza, and most often in children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What did researchers in this study find out about children with ANE?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2836871?guestAccessKey=cf976c38-c219-4f1e-968a-5728eafd28e6&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=073025&amp;amp;utm_source=BulletinHealthCare&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=073125&amp;amp;utm_content=NON-MEMBER&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_alert-morning_rounds_daily&amp;amp;utm_uid=3402323&amp;amp;utm_effort=DAMR01" target="_blank"&gt;They sought&lt;/a&gt; information from US pediatric hospitals and public health agencies regarding cases of pediatric ANE treated between October 2023 and May 2025. In total, they included 41 children with influenza-related ANE.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b3000v3b6n2hpnxjqi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The median age of these children was 5, and about 3 out of 4   were previously healthy. Importantly, just 16% of those for whom vaccination history was available had received the flu vaccine that season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b3000w3b6n4h3ejknl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All these patients became very ill, and all developed encephalopathy, or altered brain function. Sixty-eight percent had seizures. Most had abnormalities in their platelet count, liver enzymes and spinal fluid composition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b3000x3b6n0povwkw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most patients received a combination of therapies, including steroids and immunoglobulins. Out of 41 patients in the analysis, 11 died. The median period between symptom onset and death was just three days; most of the children who died had such severe brain swelling that the pressure forced the brain downward, crushing vital areas that control breathing and heart function. All but one of the children who died had not received the latest flu vaccine. Among the survivors included in the analysis, 63% had at least moderate disability.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b3000y3b6nf2r078w0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The first takeaway for me is that ANE, while rare, is extremely serious, with high morbidity and mortality. It can be deadly within a short period of time, which means prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential. Second, most children with ANE were previously healthy. Third, while some vaccinated children also became ill, most of those with ANE and nearly all of those who died had not received the flu vaccine that season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;It is not known why most people who contract flu never develop ANE, but some do. It’s also not known whether there is anything that be done once someone contracts the flu to prevent ANE.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b300113b6n9ojvlvno@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

This JAMA study also suggests that vaccination reduces the likelihood of developing ANE and of dying from it. The article and an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2837136?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jama.2025.13003" target="_blank"&gt;accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt; emphasize the importance of everyone being up-to-date with the flu vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Influenza is a common illness that can have serious complications, including in previously healthy individuals. Getting the flu vaccine is helpful both for reducing the chance of contracting the flu and for lowering the likelihood of developing complications. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html#:~:text=Everyone%206%20months%20and%20older,%2C%20pregnant%20women%2C%20and%20adults." target="_blank"&gt;recommends the flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; for virtually everyone 6 months and older. Parents should be sure that their children receive the flu vaccine in the fall and that they and others in the family are vaccinated, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeimj1b300143b6nx69k5l3y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of course, flu is not the only contagious respiratory illness that can spread in fall and winter months. It’s important for people who have fever and active respiratory symptoms to stay away from others, especially those most vulnerable to severe illness. Good hand hygiene can lower the risk of spreading contagious diseases, as can taking precautions like masking in indoor crowded settings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Archaeologists at Magna Roman Fort have uncovered leather footwear that is unusually large for the period, in some cases longer than 12 inches, with one example measuring roughly 12.8 inches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of the discovery stands out in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-roman-concrete-offers-lessons-for-sustainable-building/"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; archaeology and raises fresh questions about who was wearing what on Hadrian’s Wall. The find is not a one-off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the season’s assemblage at Magna, about a quarter of the shoes exceed 11.8 inches, while a nearby site, Vindolanda, shows only a tiny fraction of supersized examples in its long-studied collection. That contrast invites careful comparison rather than quick conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uwo.ca/classics//about-us/greene.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr Elizabeth Greene&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Professor at &lt;a href="https://www.uwo.ca/arts/"&gt;West&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uwo.ca/arts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uwo.ca/arts/"&gt;rn University&lt;/a&gt; and the Vindolanda Trust’s footwear specialist, and &lt;a href="https://ajaonline.org/author/4743/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr Andrew Birley&lt;/a&gt;, CEO and Director of Excavations at the &lt;a href="https://romanarmymuseum.com/about-vindolanda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vindolanda Trust&lt;/a&gt;, are among the researchers interpreting the new material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-surprising-size-for-roman-shoes"&gt;Surprising size for Roman shoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/317-skeletons-from-the-roman-empire-found-beneath-an-old-shopping-center/"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; footwear usually mirrors modern feet more than myths suggest, which is why Magna’s outliers get attention. Eight shoes longer than 11.8 inches have been logged so far this season, including the current Trust record at about 12.8 inches, taken from a defensive ditch just outside the fort wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What explains the upsizing here but not next door at Vindolanda, where more than 5,000 Roman shoes have been cataloged over decades of work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hypothesis is a garrison or community with different body types or supply habits, but the data set is still small and under conservation, so restraint is wise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoes are not just sizes and soles. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/archeologists-discover-sculptures-that-could-be-almost-life-size-representations-of-a-roman-family/"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; cobblers built layers of cowhide into sturdy platform shoes and pegged them with iron hobnails, so the outsole gripped and lasted on rough surfaces, which helps archaeologists read use, wear and gait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When leather survives with seams, thongs, and nail patterns, it can point to workshop traditions, supply routes, and even rank or role within a unit or household. Those are testable lines of inquiry at Magna as conservation advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clues-from-the-soil"&gt;Clues from the soil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shoes survive because the ditch fills at Magna have been at least partly anaerobic, meaning oxygen was limited and decay slowed way down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low oxygen, high groundwater, and fine sediments together create &lt;a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/preserving-archaeological-remains/heag100e-appendix4-water-monitoring-for-archaeological-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;preservation pockets&lt;/a&gt; where organic finds hang on for centuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those conditions also seal in fragile traces of daily life, like insect parts, seeds, and parasite eggs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team at Vindolanda, just a short walk east along the frontier, previously recovered roundworm and whipworm eggs from drain sediments linked to a latrine, which adds a health dimension to material culture studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-preserving-ancient-roman-shoes"&gt;Preserving ancient Roman shoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same chemistry that protects leather can be undone by drying soils, fluctuating water tables, and shifts in oxidation reduction potential (&lt;a href="https://www.gov.nt.ca/sites/ecc/files/oxidation-reduction_potential.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ORP&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Site monitoring on Hadrian’s Wall has documented the vulnerability of waterlogged archaeology to modern weather patterns, which is a polite way of saying that climate variability can accelerate loss of information in a single hot, dry season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Vindolanda, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94853-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scientists&lt;/a&gt; have paired portable X-ray fluorescence with microbial DNA surveys to track how buried conditions shape preservation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work provides a technical baseline for interpreting the state of organic artefacts and for planning how to stabilize deposits before they turn aerobic and start crumbling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can only celebrate and marvel at the diversity and differences of these people if we can still see them in the archaeological data we gather today,” said Birley, pointing to the bigger picture that sits behind a single large sole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-watch-as-analysis-continues"&gt;What to watch as analysis continues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservators expect modest shrinkage during treatment, so final measurements may tick down a hair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the current proportions already push the edges of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nasas-roman-space-telescope-hopes-to-solve-the-dark-matter-mystery/"&gt;Roman&lt;/a&gt; footwear known from Britain and justify careful comparison to the long-run dataset at Vindolanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wear patterns, nail layouts, and any surviving uppers will help distinguish winter boots from everyday shoes, and medical padding from sizing differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Context matters, so associated pottery and construction phases inside the fort will anchor the footwear in time and use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-frontier-that-keeps-teaching"&gt;Frontier that keeps teaching&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hadrian’s Wall is famous for stone and turf, but its quieter story is the organic record below the grass. When that record holds together, it can show how soldiers and families shopped, worked, walked, and stayed warm, right down to what got tracked through a doorway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why Magna’s ditch fills matter beyond a headline about big feet. They give archaeologists more than a snapshot, they give a sequence of choices across seasons and supplies that we cannot reconstruct from pottery alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-hygiene-and-the-small-stuff"&gt;Health, hygiene, and the small stuff&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists are also looking for tiny traces in the same layers, since these deposits can contain important health-related evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24141513/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paleoparasitology&lt;/a&gt; integrates microscope work with site context to trace infections across time and place, and it already has a track record in Roman Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Vindolanda, the latrine drain eggs confirmed gastrointestinal infections that were widespread across the empire, a pattern echoed by independent &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/roman-toilets-gave-no-clear-health-benefit-and-romanisation-actually-spread-parasites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; of Roman sanitation and parasite prevalence. That kind of evidence sits in the same micro-environments that keep leather intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simplest next step is the hardest: patient conservation, measurement, and context-by-context analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only then will the statistics settle enough to test whether Magna’s footwear points to taller people, different supply chains, or colder kit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the preservation question will not wait forever.

We have received about 49 patients in the whole of 2024 but this year, 2025, we have received 497 diphtheria cases during the last four months alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Deaths had risen from 13 to 42, according to a report by Ahmed’s hospital this month. The report described the resurgence of diphtheria as “one of the most urgent and dangerous threats to public health”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Earlier this month, the health ministry said it had recorded 1,616 cases and 87 deaths from the disease so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;MSF’s Somalia medical coordinator, Frida Athanassiadis, said: “We are seeing a rapid increase in diphtheria among children under 15 in central Somalia,” adding that they accounted for roughly 97% of cases. “Low vaccination coverage, vaccine hesitancy and poor living conditions are driving the spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Athanassiadis said that in some medical centres the basic resources were “insufficient to cope with rising caseloads”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;MSF said while teams initially had a small emergency stock of the antitoxin, it had now been exhausted, with the health ministry and the World Health Organization helping to distribute the “limited available stock based on needs”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In July, Save the Children warned that since April cases of measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, cholera and severe respiratory infections in Somalia had doubled from roughly 22,600 to more than 46,000. About 60% of the cases were children under five, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The sharp rise in vaccine-preventable diseases is linked to the recent aid cuts, which have impacted the health system’s capacity to deliver essential services, including routine immunisation, and to treat and run catch-up campaigns to increase the immunity necessary to halt the outbreak,” the NGO &lt;a href="https://www.savethechildren.org/us/about-us/media-and-news/2025-press-releases/infectious-diseases-in-somalia-double-in-3-months" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In Mogadishu, one resident, Abdiwahid Ali, said: “Many children in my neighbourhood are sick, some of them hospitalised.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Anab Hassan, a grocer, said people were concerned about the outbreak. “A friend of mine lost a five-year-old daughter who was diagnosed with diphtheria, and several others told me their children are sick and coughing,” she said. “We hear about children getting sick every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 17:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQS3ZkYm1YR0N0QjhyVGlaZ084dndNMmNvUEsxTm43OFdqczFHVVA1S3dlZzJ5QVJ4bElfSUNGT2NSd0FtbFBLYVRvV0F5dEd1RWJqM2RBd0dGS1FEbzhEV2tPejdsZGt1RnJjM2FYTnFTQl9oQlJIMEpCQ1NhS3VpQkpYMlpxcUds</guid></item><item><title>整个费城地区西尼罗河病毒感染率不断上升-费城6abc</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPclNEOXQyRG1jYnNWY1ZpWl9WdVU5OHAzRTZWMklYT0pzRHJZWlpobVpzUkdieDkyY0pKTkJMWkNQOW5tX2ctTzlGcjhZUEZwVGZ0STdXR2c4WksxSTB5MkxCUFBhRkVNQ1NWMjR6TVpUNERqMTZ4T0oxNHh2enlLaDE4cUhGZHlRODZTSNIBkgFBVV95cUxNSXJVUy1VMnlzOF8wdjF0dXBYbzhzME5IUnRuSS1qYkF6YlM3eS1PSzVBWFEtOG5MaXVyaHMwVkJPbUQtdk9JZ2VxN0YzZU1PU0tLYlNRNG5VZGFleEpCcVl4cDNxbEExb1ktamdLT3BBdm5XcncwUHA1b21aMmxiWl80aEtSTXU1R2h3bXh4a2RFUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="theme-e FITT_Article_main__body oBTii mrzah " data-testid="prism-GridColumn"&gt;&lt;div class="dHdHP jLREf zXXje aGO eCClZ nTLv jLsYA gmuro TOSFd VmeZt sCkVm hkQai wGrlE MUuGM fciaN qQjt DhNVo Tgcqk IGLAf tWjkv "&gt;&lt;p class="kCTVx qtHut lqtkC HkWF HfYhe kGyAC " data-testid="prism-headline"&gt;&lt;h1 class="vMjAx eeTZd tntuS eHrJ "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Rates of West Nile Virus increasing throughout Philadelphia region&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="QHblV nkdHX mHUQ kvZxL hTosT whbOj " data-testid="prism-byline"&gt;&lt;div class="VZTD mLASH BQWr OcxMG oJce "&gt;&lt;div class="kKfXc ubAkB VZTD rEPuv "&gt;&lt;div class="VZTD mLASH gpiba "&gt;&lt;p class="jTKbV zIIsP ZdbeE xAPpq QtiLO JQYD "&gt;Tuesday, August 19, 2025 4:42PM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="LeadVideoWrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="ScrollSpy_container"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="VideoCaption nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU eEzcu lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Officials say West Nile Virus has been detected in mosquitoes in nearly every Pennsylvania county.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="XQpSH " data-testid="prism-divider"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;The rates of West Nile Virus are increasing throughout the Philadelphia region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This is placing people at significant risk for the mosquito-borne illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;No one has tested positive for West Nile in Pennsylvania this year.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="47" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy0zc00123b79n5u3ef2f@published"&gt;I recently started casually online dating after leaving an abusive marriage, and it’s been going great! There have been lots of nice guys, and we have had some sexy fun. That said, I’ve run into a weird situation that I’m almost certainly overthinking but am baffled by.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy11a00133b79nfn96917@published"&gt;I used to work in adult retail in my early 20s and am a very empathetic and sex positive person, all of which is information I share either before meeting or on the first date. I went on a first date last night with a great, interesting, funny guy that I got along very well with, who told me after dinner that he has a medical condition that causes incredibly painful erections and, because of this, has had difficulty with intercourse (and subsequently, online dating). Being the curious and empathetic person I am, I asked if he wanted to take me back to my place, and we had some really incredible foreplay.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy13700143b79ftv82enj@published"&gt;When his pants came off, I found that his penis was bent upwards in a U shape with his head pointing back towards his stomach. I saw a decent assortment of penises in my porn store days and am good at keeping my face neutral when I see something new at this point (with my apologies to the guy with the micropenis I slept with when I was 19), so I modified my usual blowjob routine to work with what I had and we were able to have relatively satisfying PIV intercourse, that he initiated. I have two questions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="201" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy15700153b793pq807gi@published"&gt;How can I balance wanting to make sure he’s not in pain and is enjoying things as we try stuff out with not completely killing the mood every time we switch to something new, especially since there isn’t a blanket answer to what will or won’t be painful on a given encounter? He has the type of personality where I’m concerned he might not vocalize that he’s in pain, so I don’t feel weird about the whole thing, but I don’t want to be causing him discomfort. My other question, and I feel bad for saying this, is… I love a good dick. So much. And after getting out of a bad marriage with bad sex, I was really looking forward to exploring the world of dicks for a while. I’ve been open with him about the fact that I’m just casually dating at this point, so I’m not especially concerned that I’m leading him on, but am I a total … dick if I come to realize that it’s a deal-breaker for me? And if it is, how do I say or not say that so that I don’t make this sweet man feel any more awkward about his condition?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="3" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy19900173b79g0g4bd1p@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Getting Bent,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy1bb00183b79anb32nxu@published"&gt;Talk to him about how, in general, you need to feel like your sexual partners will let you know if they’re in discomfort. Make it clear that this is something important to you, regardless of the individual’s body or any rare differences, but, you know, without emphasizing the latter excessively. Ask him whether he feels like he’s able to do that. If he’s unsure, find out what might be holding him back from doing so. If you still aren’t comfortable assuming he’ll say something in the moment, that’s a cue to move along.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy1da00193b79jljbdqo5@published"&gt;You almost certainly already have some awareness of his facial expressions, body language, and vocalizations during sex. During this initial phase, focus a little extra on understanding what he looks and sounds like when he’s having a good time, and when he’s experiencing discomfort, until you feel like you have a pretty good grasp of his individual lexicon. If you’re inclined to notice tactile cues, such as certain parts of his body developing tension, make note of those as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy1fg001a3b79tbx11m18@published"&gt;From there, it’s the same reliance on the twin pillars of “I trust this person to usually notice and speak up if they’re uncomfortable” and “I trust myself to usually notice if their signs of pleasure stop or signs of pain start” that we tend to have in sexual encounters. Even together, the two aren’t completely foolproof. But they are the best we can do without the ability to read minds.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy1i0001b3b79zkaaeu4g@published"&gt;As for whether it’s a dick move to decide that the sex isn’t working for you in a way that your partner can’t do anything about, broadly speaking, I’d say no. No more than it’s a dick move to decide you’re unwilling to relocate to a different city, live a significantly different type of lifestyle, or date people of genders outside your sexual orientation. What would be a dick move, though, is focusing entirely on people’s dicks as a metric of whether you’re interested in continuing to see them. I suspect that when you’re considering your dates, you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; factoring in many other features. So, as much as this man’s member is quite the outlier, keep an eye on the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioy1k2001c3b792051ppil@published"&gt;If you do decide to end the relationship, remember that no matter how gentle you are, you can’t control how he reacts. There’s one possible world where you let him know that you’re no longer interested in seeing each other, and he’s relieved because he’s been trying to figure out a way to break things off with you. There’s another where you end the relationship over, say, political views, and he still makes it out to be a rejection over his dick. One thing you can do at this stage, while you’re waiting to find out what your feelings are toward him (and his anatomy), is resist any temptation to see him every other day or stay in constant contact—keep things as casual as you’ve told him they’re going to be.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="200" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfg001p3b79cnpsqc16@published"&gt;As a 21-year-old woman who is a virgin, I know I’m late to sex. I’d ideally like to start having some—but be it because of my generation’s sex recession, my own shyness, or the complete absence of dating culture, the opportunity has never really presented itself. I never dated in high school (I wasn’t interested, and was too focused on getting into college to have a relationship), and by the time I got to college, I just kind of assumed it would happen on its own. But in truth, there isn’t much of a culture of hookups or dating at my college, as it’s very small and competitive. Everyone is pretty awkward all around. I’ve had a longer-term relationship with a guy before, but he was religious and wanted to wait until marriage, so nothing ever happened (we broke up for reasons unrelated to sex). Hinge led to a handful of OK first dates, and Tinder led to six cancellations and two honestly terrible in-person encounters. I’ve since deleted the apps to focus on school and just to get off my phone. At this point, I’m not even sure if I’m into men, or if I might lean more lesbian.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfi001q3b7982ulrkgn@published"&gt;I felt like my college years were hyped up as a time of casual sex, exploration, and fun. I genuinely don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’m decently attractive, funny, and have plenty of friends at school and work; in all other ways but this, I have my life together. My parents and relatives frequently question why I’m not in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfi001r3b790ze6kzvp@published"&gt;Is there any way forward in this situation? I’m not looking for a long-term relationship right now, but should I try for one just to see where things go? Redownload the apps, or try a different platform? Or just surrender and accept that my virginity doesn’t really matter to anyone but me?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfj001u3b7957lp7tzj@published"&gt;I’m guessing that part of your perception of college as a time of casual sex, exploration, and fun comes from the media you were exposed to growing up—be that social media or television and film. But both memes and movies tend to distort reality. A whole bunch of people in previous generations got through college and then found themselves feeling they’d missed out on a big bacchanal. Also, &lt;a href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/i-lived-through-peak-indie-sleaze-gen-z-need-to-stop-glamourising-it"&gt;a lot of Millennial hook-up culture took place in a context of large quantities of alcohol and substances&lt;/a&gt;, which has a way of removing inhibitions. Given the ways that inebriation clouds consent, it’s for the best that this former fad has faded.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfj001v3b796ivzd88g@published"&gt;Another cultural institution that seems to be transforming is the dating app. Where 15 to 20 years ago, dating apps often felt like they were opening up a whole world of romantic and sexual partners we might be more likely to share interests and desires with, many people now describe them with a lot of frustration, often lamenting that they’re full of scammers and profiles that seem to be bots. Mostly, though, lots of people—including your peers, and maybe even some of your classmates—are having the same desire you describe of wanting to get off their devices.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="188" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfj001w3b79xa7fmuh0@published"&gt;So get out there and meet people. Join a club, bring any schoolwork that can be done in a public space to a cafe or similar, and go out with friends. Do whatever you can to put yourself in situations where you might socialize. Keep an open mind about whether the people you’re meeting will fit in your life at all, and especially what form being in your life might take. Maybe you make some new friends, you find someone to hook up with, or you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; find someone you want to develop something longer-term and romantic with (and who wants the same with you). Yes, there will likely be some awkward moments. Those uncomfortable moments often decrease with experience and practice. Most of your cohort are probably in a similar position—they all went through the upheaval of COVID lockdowns in their high school years, too, and you’re all part of the same generation that is reportedly going through a “sex recession” (however &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/04/gen-z-generation-sex-abstience-puriteen-research-studies.html"&gt;actually accurate&lt;/a&gt; that is). Even if sparks aren’t flying, you can support each other through the experiences you’re having and longings you’re hoping to fulfill.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeioyvfk001x3b79cd71yxzs@published"&gt;Your virginity likely won’t matter to most people nearly as much as it matters to you—although every once in a while someone does make a big deal of it in one way or another—but &lt;em&gt;it matters to you&lt;/em&gt;. Build a support network that will hopefully help you through that, and you might meet someone whose desires align with yours along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the past several years, we’ve slowly incorporated various toys into our sex life to great success. Our most prized possessions are a few large dildos that have become part of our standard repertoire. My wife loves being stretched out, and I love pleasuring her with them. It’s a win-win, and we have a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiozc66002b3b79iakjoy2p@published"&gt;Over the past year or two, however, my wife has been getting sporadic UTIs and yeast infections, and they’ve always come on the heels of a session with the big boys. We always do our best to keep everything sanitized, and we always make sure that the toys are cleaned thoroughly with anti-bacterial soap after each use and stored separately in their own bags. The dildos are never used for anything other than vaginal insertion.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiozc67002c3b793ot8s0vd@published"&gt;A few months ago, we decided to start putting condoms over the dildos to prevent any infection. (We still maintain the old cleaning routine, too. That hasn’t changed.) Things were going great until our last session, when my wife got yet another yeast infection after an evening with her largest toy wrapped up in a condom. We are both feeling frustrated and stumped. We love playing with the toys but it’s crushing for me to see her in discomfort and pain the day after a fun evening. Is this just a normal risk of using large toys? Are there better precautions that we could be taking? Is there something we’re missing?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeiozc67002e3b7900ypzlrg@published"&gt;It’s worth your wife making a trip to her gynecologist, explaining the situation, and asking for some extra testing to confirm that what she’s experiencing really is recurring UTIs and yeast infections. So many different factors can throw off a vaginal microbiome, and more than one can result in the kind of discharge that looks like a yeast infection or the symptoms that read as a UTI, but it could be &lt;a href="https://www.bannerhealth.com/healthcareblog/better-me/is-it-a-yeast-infection-or-something-else"&gt;something else entirely&lt;/a&gt;. She should call the office, explain the situation briefly, and ask when it is best to come in—sometimes the doctor needs to see the issue when it’s active, and sometimes they want certain tests run before the appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

Since both of you enjoy this practice, it might be that big toys need to be a special occasion activity and reserved for times when she’ll be able to recover in comfort afterward. The good news is that there’s a whole wild world of sexual practices outside of big toys, and a significant chance that you’ll be able to find something else you both love just as much to fold into your repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;

But one health gym-goer revealed she was drinking so much it nearly killed her (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a piece for &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/08/water-hydration-exercise-heat-hyponatremia.html"&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;, Cameron wrote on&lt;span&gt; top of her water consumption she would consume more liquid through her 'morning coffees, a soda here and there, food (water filled!)', and any other drinks she happened to have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The writer explained: 'Altogether, I was getting too much water. Way, way too much. And now I was in danger.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Mayo Clinic, women should drink about 11.5 cups of water per day (2.7 liters), while men should consume 15.5 cups (3.7 liters).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, if you're exercising in the heat, aim for four to eight ounces every 20 minutes, depending on the intensity of the workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cameron was drinking to keep hydrated but she wasn't replacing the sodium lost from her sweat through sodium-rich foods and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sports drinks packed with electrolytes are one of the most convenient options for athletes or those engaging in intense physical activity to keep their sodium levels in check. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthy sodium levels in the blood typically range from 135 to 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) or millimoles per liter (mmol/L) and a level below this range is considered hyponatremia, or low sodium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cameron did not reveal what her reading was, just that it was below the healthy level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hyponatremia occurs when drinking too much water within a short time frame overwhelms the body's organs, namely the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Normally, the kidneys filter out extra water and waste, producing urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Thunder Jalili, a professor of nutrition and integrative physiology at the University of Utah, previously told the Wall Street Journal that a person's kidneys can typically filter out one liter of water every hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you drink more than a liter of water an hour, that's when you run into the risk of potentially diluting your electrolytes,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;John Putnam (pictured), then 74, suffered heart attack-like symptoms after drinking too much water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include sodium, which is vital for regulating the amount of fluid in the body, but having too little of it causes water to build up around the body's cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cells then swell, leading to nausea, vomiting, headaches, confusion, muscle weakness, dizziness, and restlessness. But in more severe cases, such as Putnam's, it can lead to heart attack-like symptoms such as chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cameron said her doctor's response was 'blunt' and she was told that if she didn't change her habits she would be 'risking far worse than a headache.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was told to drink no more than a liter of fluid daily for several days in order to bring her sodium levels back to a healthy baseline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a person used to drinking up to four liters a day, she found that cutting back was 'hard.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years on from her initial diagnosis, Cameron wrote that she is better at monitoring her water intake but she is still not perfect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concluded: 'Have I learned my lesson? Sort of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’ve been diagnosed with hyponatremia more than once since that first instance; my doctor thinks I’m one of those people that just run a little low on sodium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I have made changes. I make a conscious effort to notice my thirst while exercising. When I know I’m going to be sweating a lot, I also take an electrolyte mix called LMNT, which I order online; it contains almost half of my daily recommended sodium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I also feel entirely at liberty with the table salt. It’s working for me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cameron's story comes about a year after Texas resident John Putnam, then 74, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13714529/texas-man-rushed-hospital-water-toxicity-heart-attack.html"&gt;suffered heart attack-like symptoms after drinking too much water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Putnam was working as a landscaper in June 2024 when the temperatures reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time he mowed his second lawn of the day, Putnam was so thirsty he had consumed almost three gallons of water within five hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he was overcome with nausea and fatigue, which turned into chest pain and trouble breathing by evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Putnam was rushed to the hospital for what he believed was a heart attack. Instead, doctors told him he had suffered water poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have suspected that water toxicity is on the rise due to an increase in heat waves across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that the condition affects anywhere from 3million to 6million Americans every year, or at least one in 100 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hyponatremia can also be more common in older adults like Putnam. According to the Mayo Clinic, this is because older patients are more likely to take medications or suffer from conditions that lower their sodium levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases of hyponatremia, brain cells swell and lead to pressure inside the skull. Blood flow to the brain then becomes reduced, resulting in seizures, coma, and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for hyponatremia depends on the severity of the condition. For mild cases, doctors may restrict fluids. However, more severe cases may require medications to manage low sodium levels or replacing sodium intravenously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But one health gym-goer revealed she was drinking so much it nearly killed her (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a piece for &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/08/water-hydration-exercise-heat-hyponatremia.html"&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt;, Cameron wrote on&lt;span&gt; top of her water consumption she would consume more liquid through her 'morning coffees, a soda here and there, food (water filled!)', and any other drinks she happened to have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The writer explained: 'Altogether, I was getting too much water. Way, way too much. And now I was in danger.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Mayo Clinic, women should drink about 11.5 cups of water per day (2.7 liters), while men should consume 15.5 cups (3.7 liters).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, if you're exercising in the heat, aim for four to eight ounces every 20 minutes, depending on the intensity of the workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cameron was drinking to keep hydrated but she wasn't replacing the sodium lost from her sweat through sodium-rich foods and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sports drinks packed with electrolytes are one of the most convenient options for athletes or those engaging in intense physical activity to keep their sodium levels in check. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthy sodium levels in the blood typically range from 135 to 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) or millimoles per liter (mmol/L) and a level below this range is considered hyponatremia, or low sodium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cameron did not reveal what her reading was, just that it was below the healthy level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hyponatremia occurs when drinking too much water within a short time frame overwhelms the body's organs, namely the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Normally, the kidneys filter out extra water and waste, producing urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Thunder Jalili, a professor of nutrition and integrative physiology at the University of Utah, previously told the Wall Street Journal that a person's kidneys can typically filter out one liter of water every hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you drink more than a liter of water an hour, that's when you run into the risk of potentially diluting your electrolytes,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;John Putnam (pictured), then 74, suffered heart attack-like symptoms after drinking too much water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include sodium, which is vital for regulating the amount of fluid in the body, but having too little of it causes water to build up around the body's cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cells then swell, leading to nausea, vomiting, headaches, confusion, muscle weakness, dizziness, and restlessness. But in more severe cases, such as Putnam's, it can lead to heart attack-like symptoms such as chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cameron said her doctor's response was 'blunt' and she was told that if she didn't change her habits she would be 'risking far worse than a headache.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was told to drink no more than a liter of fluid daily for several days in order to bring her sodium levels back to a healthy baseline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a person used to drinking up to four liters a day, she found that cutting back was 'hard.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years on from her initial diagnosis, Cameron wrote that she is better at monitoring her water intake but she is still not perfect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concluded: 'Have I learned my lesson? Sort of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’ve been diagnosed with hyponatremia more than once since that first instance; my doctor thinks I’m one of those people that just run a little low on sodium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I have made changes. I make a conscious effort to notice my thirst while exercising. When I know I’m going to be sweating a lot, I also take an electrolyte mix called LMNT, which I order online; it contains almost half of my daily recommended sodium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I also feel entirely at liberty with the table salt. It’s working for me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cameron's story comes about a year after Texas resident John Putnam, then 74, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13714529/texas-man-rushed-hospital-water-toxicity-heart-attack.html"&gt;suffered heart attack-like symptoms after drinking too much water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Putnam was working as a landscaper in June 2024 when the temperatures reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time he mowed his second lawn of the day, Putnam was so thirsty he had consumed almost three gallons of water within five hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he was overcome with nausea and fatigue, which turned into chest pain and trouble breathing by evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Putnam was rushed to the hospital for what he believed was a heart attack. Instead, doctors told him he had suffered water poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have suspected that water toxicity is on the rise due to an increase in heat waves across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that the condition affects anywhere from 3million to 6million Americans every year, or at least one in 100 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hyponatremia can also be more common in older adults like Putnam. According to the Mayo Clinic, this is because older patients are more likely to take medications or suffer from conditions that lower their sodium levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases of hyponatremia, brain cells swell and lead to pressure inside the skull. Blood flow to the brain then becomes reduced, resulting in seizures, coma, and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for hyponatremia depends on the severity of the condition. For mild cases, doctors may restrict fluids. However, more severe cases may require medications to manage low sodium levels or replacing sodium intravenously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A once-vanquished disease spread by mosquitoes may be making inroads into the United States. New Jersey officials are now investigating whether a resident’s malaria infection was locally acquired.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New Jersey Departments of Health (NJDOH) and Environmental Protection &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2025/approved/20250818a.shtml"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on the case Monday. The resident hadn’t recently traveled, suggesting they likely caught it from homegrown mosquitoes. If so, this would be the first locally acquired malaria case seen in the state in over three decades, though not the first such case reported in the country this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The blood-loving parasite&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/index.html"&gt;Malaria&lt;/a&gt; is caused by several species of the single-celled parasite &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt;. When an infected mosquito transmits the disease to a person, the parasites will first invade certain tissues (usually the liver), reproduce, and then infect red blood cells. A small percentage of the parasites in the bloodstream will develop into a stage of life that can newly infect and grow inside mosquitoes that bite the person, starting the cycle all over again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The symptoms of malaria, which include fatigue, chills, and other flu-like illnesses, are caused by the damage the infection causes to our blood cells. Though most people survive their bout of malaria, it can also cause life-threatening complications like seizures, kidney failure, and sepsis. Even with available treatments today, malaria still &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria"&gt;kills&lt;/a&gt; roughly 600,000 people worldwide every year—making it one of the deadliest diseases around.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Malaria was once a common threat in the U.S., particularly in warmer areas during the summer. But a dedicated public health campaign, which included mosquito spraying programs and the removal of breeding sites, eradicated the disease by the 1950s. Since then, just about all malaria cases reported in the U.S. are travel-related, originating from places where the disease is endemic. But the potential for malaria to make a comeback remains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A mosquito mystery&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Malaria is spread by the bite of a female &lt;em&gt;Anopheles&lt;/em&gt; mosquito, and there are native species in the U.S. that can transmit the disease to humans, including in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though officials are unsure about the origin of this latest case, it’s possible that a person with travel-related malaria arrived in the area and was bitten by a mosquito that may have then bitten someone else. According to health officials, roughly 100 travel-related cases are reported annually in the state. If this new case is confirmed as local, this would be the first homegrown case documented in New Jersey since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Officials say that malaria’s threat to the greater public is minimal, but other recent cases have been locally acquired. In 2023, for instance, there were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00496.html"&gt;three separate clusters&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, Texas, and Maryland (at the time, they were the first local U.S. cases documented in two decades). And earlier this month, Washington officials &lt;a href="https://tpchd.org/news/we-are-investigating-possible-locally-acquired-case-of-malaria/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; their own possible homegrown case of malaria, quite possibly the first ever found in the state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Low as people’s risk of malaria may be, we should still do our best to prevent mosquito bites. There are other diseases that mosquitoes in the U.S. can spread outside of malaria, including West Nile virus, Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), and even dengue fever. We can personally reduce bites by using insect repellent and wearing long-sleeved clothing. And people should also do their part to clean up areas around their homes that could turn into literal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I urge the public to continue taking steps to eliminate standing water around their properties, which will go a long way to reducing the risk of mosquito breeding,” said Shawn M. LaTourette, NJ Environmental Protection Commissioner, in a &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2025/approved/20250818a.shtml"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “As the summer winds down, taking this simple but necessary step will help ensure quality of life and protect public health.”&lt;/p&gt;

The signals vary widely from person to person and from one moment to the next, which means no one should rush to treat a single breath reading as proof of recent use or impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/people/jennifer-berry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jennifer L. Berry&lt;/a&gt; is a research chemist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (&lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NIST&lt;/a&gt;). She worked alongside colleagues from the same institution and a partnering medical campus who contributed to the study’s design and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-thc-breath-tests-matter"&gt;Why THC breath tests matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long wanted a simple roadside tool, but chemistry keeps getting in the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THC and related &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11264354/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabinoids&lt;/a&gt; are large, sticky molecules that ride in airborne droplets rather than cleanly evaporating like alcohol, which complicates collection and measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why teams now test both aerosol capture devices and exhaled breath condensate (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2170898/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EBC&lt;/a&gt;) approaches that chill the breath to trap what comes out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with these methods, prior studies found THC hanging around before any observed use, a reminder that abstinence windows and device sensitivity can skew results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-study-learned"&gt;What the study learned&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study enrolled 29 adults, asked them to abstain ahead of time, and collected breath samples before consumption and again at about 47 minutes, 92 minutes, and 180 minutes after eating their own labeled edible product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two devices were used, one designed to catch aerosol particles and another that collects a cooled condensate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then analyzed each sample for THC and 10 other cannabinoids using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the abstinence requests, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/popular-new-thc-variant-delta-8-is-not-harmless-despite-marketing-claims/"&gt;THC&lt;/a&gt; appeared in pre-use breath from 27 of 29 participants, ranging from trace levels to more than 0.4 ng per device. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After edible ingestion, 19 participants showed a significant increase at one or more post-use time points, 4 showed no change, and 6 showed a significant decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This proof-of-concept study shows that THC concentration in breath can increase after the ingestion of cannabis-infused edibles, but the uncertainty of breath measurements and a longer time window need to be further explored,” wrote Berry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-thc-breath-tests-and-baseline-issues"&gt;THC breath tests and baseline issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The finding of detectable and/or quantifiable THC before cannabis use shows how challenging it is to interpret a single THC concentration measurement in breath with no prior information about THC at baseline,” wrote Berry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most striking pattern, beyond the individual variability, is the high rate of detectable THC before anyone ate an edible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That baseline problem is not unique to breath. A 2025 systematic &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12032524/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of studies connecting blood THC to driving performance found that most papers reported no linear relationship, even when driving metrics like lateral control and reaction time were measured with care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oral fluid tests are popular because they are easy to use, but their purpose matters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35640367/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of over 18,000 paired samples found that although THC in oral fluid can show whether THC is present in the blood, using it to identify drivers above standard blood limits would lead to many false positives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIST’s own breath work in cannabis smokers supports taking repeated measurements rather than a one-off reading, since THC often falls sharply within hours and device methods differ in what they capture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, the new edible study adds a missing piece, but it does not turn breath into an instant yes or no test. It suggests that trends over time, not single snapshots, are more promising for identifying recent use across routes of administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means"&gt;What this means&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffic safety policy has leaned on numerical cutoffs for alcohol for decades. Cannabis does not play by the same rules, and federal safety agencies have said as much in &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/documents/812440-marijuana-impaired-driving-report-to-congress.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; to Congress that caution against equating blood THC numbers with impairment in the way we do for alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have chronic users versus infrequent users, they have very different concentrations correlated to different effects,” said &lt;a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/library/podcast/whats-known-and-unknown-about-marijuana-part2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frances Scott&lt;/a&gt;, a physical scientist at NIJ’s Office of Investigative and Forensic Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also tracked other cannabinoids. In many participants, CBN and CBG rose and fell in step with THC, while CBD sometimes did not, a hint that multi-analyte panels or ratios may carry more information than THC alone when the goal is to pinpoint recent use after edibles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern echoes earlier breath work showing some non-THC &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trema-micrantha-brazilian-plant-contains-cbd-without-thc-found-in-cannabis/"&gt;cannabinoids&lt;/a&gt; appear only after use and could act as markers when combined with THC kinetics. It is a direction that calls for standard methods, shared reference materials, and longer sampling windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-for-thc-breath-tests"&gt;Next steps for THC breath tests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a small, carefully designed study without standardized dosing, and participants brought their own edibles labeled &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-relieves-anxiety-without-the-risks-that-come-with-thc/"&gt;THC&lt;/a&gt; that the researchers did not independently verify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sampling ended at 3 hours, which likely missed some peak values, and device differences could influence capture and recovery. None of the breath measures were tied directly to driving performance in this experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A credible breath test will require validated collection protocols, calibration standards, and clear guidance on how to interpret rising or falling readings over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those pieces are starting to come together in studies that map breath changes minute by minute and compare matrices side by side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the message is measured. Breath can carry THC after edibles, the kinetics can be tracked, and multi-timepoint strategies may be the fairest and most informative way to use that signal in real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jat/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jat/bkaf063/8196217" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Analytical Toxicology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 15:05:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPU3hHNkxqQ25ZTEcxeDFWeC1LN0MyMDdRVzdoUnFmZjVNRmQ1YjJnMzNHdjRKU3hveWRRRGhhcXVOanBHbURlek45dDJtTE1JUDJKUzVFX1hJZldjNlpvN3dGSWRRcWdxOFJFMHNkNkFQNjJ1YnlsZGFPTENqVFh2dGt4aTFvaFBuNDNrdGQ2VHNFT1hfS2VVVDNveXhoc3U4MlZzRjdYQkJpb09KQWJHUHlEeEJJS3BFMDJKNg</guid></item><item><title>茶的温度可能会使您面临某些癌症的风险- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxPLXEzQ1VvWW1zeXNxYkFaRzNxZTVYQWFDZENqTm5zTG8tYTl3eFA5ZExNLXRZUkdqVHUzc1VYcDhLQUFqOEV5RThlbmFMbUw2TnF0SHlXZFB2NkY5NVM5R29OR3lHbUZxMG5vVWRETmg0bmZ4YkFUaXlTalBzaGJjNE9RbGVGRWNPTzVqR0hwSnJWZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

The exact temperature to brew tea or serve coffee for the best flavour is &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-11-30/ordering-extra-hot-coffee-does-it-change-flavour/101708102"&gt;hotly debated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there may be something else you're not considering: your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coffee-doesn-t-cause-cancer-but-extremely-hot-beverages-might-who-says"&gt;Coffee Doesn't Cause Cancer, But Extremely Hot Drinks Might, Says WHO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, hot drinks can be too hot – and are even linked to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="171735" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. So, let's take a look at the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What's the link between hot drinks and cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence for a link between hot drinks and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20395127/"&gt;throat&lt;/a&gt; cancer and the evidence for a link between hot drinks and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22296352/"&gt;stomach cancer&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2363606/pdf/84-6691561a.pdf"&gt;unclear&lt;/a&gt;. But there is a link between hot drinks and cancers of the "food pipe" or &lt;a href="https://www.canceraustralia.gov.au/cancer-types/oesophageal-cancer"&gt;oesophagus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the International Agency for Research on Cancer &lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pr244_E.pdf"&gt;classified&lt;/a&gt; drinking very hot beverages, meaning above 65°C, as "probably carcinogenic to humans" – this is the &lt;a href="https://monographs.iarc.who.int/list-of-classifications"&gt;same risk&lt;/a&gt; category as emissions from indoor wood smoke or eating a lot of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171737" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171737" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hot_tea_cancer1_642.jpg" alt="hot coffee" class="wp-image-171737 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hot_tea_cancer1_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hot_tea_cancer1_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hot_tea_cancer1_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171737" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Gulping down hot beverages could be as risky for cancer as eating red meat.

Researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.24445"&gt;first proposed&lt;/a&gt; this link almost 90 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we know about how hot drinks can damage the oesophagus mainly comes from animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very hot water may accelerate cancer growth. One &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexmp.2016.02.005"&gt;animal study&lt;/a&gt; from 2016 studied mice that were prone to developing cancer. Mice given very hot water (70°C) were more likely to develop precancerous growths in the oesophagus, and sooner, compared to mice given water at lower temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpgi.1999.276.6.G1322"&gt;Another theory&lt;/a&gt; is that heat damage to the oesophagus lining weakens its normal barrier, increasing the risk of further damage from gastric acid reflux (from the stomach). Over time, this chronic damage can increase the chance of oesophageal cancer developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Does how much you drink matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of cancer may depend on how much hot liquid you drink in one sitting and how quickly. It seems drinking a lot in one go is more likely to damage the oesophagus by causing a heat injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.13.1.24"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers measured the temperature inside the oesophagus of people drinking hot coffee at different temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found the size of the sip the person took had more impact than how hot the drink was. A very big sip (20 millilitres) of 65°C coffee increased the temperature inside the oesophagus by up to 12°C. Over time, large sips can lead to sustained heat injury that can damage cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171739" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171739" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hot_tea_cancer2_642.jpg" alt="woman sipping from a cup" class="wp-image-171739 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hot_tea_cancer2_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hot_tea_cancer2_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/hot_tea_cancer2_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171739" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sipping your hot drink can significantly lower the temperature it hits your esophagus.

But over years, drinking large amounts of very hot drinks could very well increase the risk of oesophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, what's a safe temperature?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1750-3841.14699"&gt;brewing temperatures&lt;/a&gt; for drinks such as coffee are very high – often close to the boiling point of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, takeaway hot drinks &lt;a href="https://foodsci.oregonstate.edu/sites/agscid7/files/foodsci/attachments/hot-bev-temp.pdf"&gt;may be sometimes&lt;/a&gt; be served at very high temperatures (around 90°C) to allow for cooling when people drink them later at the office or home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18226454/"&gt;One study from the United States&lt;/a&gt; calculated the ideal temperature for coffee, factoring in the risk of heat injury to the oesophagus while preserving flavour and taste. The researchers came up with an optimum temperature of 57.8°C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips to consume hot drinks safely&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow down, take your time and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allowing time for a very hot drink to cool is important and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.14699"&gt;research has shown&lt;/a&gt; a hot drink's temperature can drop by 10–15°C in five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other things that may help cool a hot drink:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, small sips are a good idea to test the temperature, given we know having a large amount has a significant impact on &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1411981/"&gt;the temperature inside the oesophagus&lt;/a&gt; and potential damage to its lining.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261256/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

But then a patient’s neurons try to react to that, and fire up again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But stimulating neurons, Fregni said, seems to help regulate chronic pain by initially overactivating the neurons involved in pain processing, and then the neurons relax, bringing down the pain circuit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;His &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2835058" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2835058"&gt;recent study &lt;/a&gt;used electrical brain stimulation, along with exercise, and pain education for 112 women with fibromyalgia, and found the approach effective for helping to manage pain. The researchers taught the participants how to operate the brain stimulation device at home, and they were instructed to do this five times a week for four weeks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Fregni said the pain relief benefits started to decrease four weeks after the treatments ended.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Whatever is causing fibromyalgia, [brain stimulation] is not reaching the cause of whatever may lead to dysfunction in brain plasticity,” he said. The stimulation “is trying to balance the plasticity, trying to create an environment to better decrease pain, but whatever is causing it is still there.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;a href="https://med.uth.edu/psychiatry/2022/11/11/rodrigo-machado-vieira-md-phd-msc/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://med.uth.edu/psychiatry/2022/11/11/rodrigo-machado-vieira-md-phd-msc/"&gt;Dr. Rodrigo Machado-Vieira&lt;/a&gt;, a psychiatry professor at the McGovern Medical School at &lt;a href="https://www.uthouston.edu/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; UTHealth Houston&lt;/a&gt;, was lead researcher in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03305-y" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03305-y"&gt;study published last year&lt;/a&gt; involving 174 adults with moderate to severe depression.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;They were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: electrical brain stimulation, or inactive stimulation, which used the same device but did not provide a current. Participants were taught how to use the device at home and followed a 10-week course of treatment. Those who received the electrical stimulation showed significant improvements in the severity of their depression, compared to those who used the inactive device.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Machado-Vieira said some patients respond better to electrical versus magnetic stimulation, and vice-versa, but researchers still don’t understand why. One benefit of electrical rather than magnetic, however, is that the electrical devices being tested now are much smaller and lighter than the magnetic ones typically only used in doctors’ offices. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Machado-Vieira and other scientists said getting federal regulators to approve small electrical stimulation devices that can be used at home would make the treatment more widely accessible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“In terms of convenience for people who live far away, or who cannot travel to sessions at the clinic, that’s a clear advantage of the [electrical devices], but that doesn’t mean that they are going to respond better to that,” compared to magnetic stimulation, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Machado-Vieira also said brain stimulation alone, without medications, is probably not powerful enough to treat major depression. But he understands as a clinician who has long treated patients, that some just won’t stick with their medications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt; “Psychiatric medications have some level of stigma,” he said. “There are some groups of patients who really are not willing to take antidepressants and would benefit from this [brain stimulation] type of intervention.”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

In 2019, there were over 9,000 cases, up from less than 1,000 cases reported each year in 2000. The spike has alarmed researchers and health officials since it appears that cases might continue to climb in the years to come as a result of climate change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is Valley Fever? Here's what we know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus that causes Valley Fever, sometimes called coccidioidomycosis or “cocci,” develops in the soil in various areas of California and other southwestern states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both humans and animals are susceptible to the Valley Fever, and it is transmitted via airborne spores that are inhaled into the lungs. It causes respiratory symptoms like fever, coughing, chest pain, and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/unsettled-cdc-shooter-patrick-joseph-white-was-armed-with-five-firearms-report-101754789178438.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="CDC"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;), it is frequently misdiagnosed or goes untreated due to its symptoms' resemblance to those of other respiratory illnesses, including pneumonia and even COVID. As a result, some patients may receive poor treatment or have delays in receiving the proper care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Read:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/google-issues-red-alert-as-new-cyber-attack-targets-gmail-users-using-ai-with-indirect-prompt-injections-101755600288240.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Google issues red alert as new cyber attack targets Gmail users using AI with ‘indirect prompt injections’"&gt;Google issues red alert as new cyber attack targets Gmail users using AI with ‘indirect prompt injections’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some people may inhale the spores and not become unwell, while others are prone to acquire a more serious sickness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who are particularly susceptible include pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems, people over 60, people with diabetes, and people who work in construction or other jobs where they are frequently exposed to dust and dirt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As per the CDC, 1 percent of individuals who contract Valley Fever may experience an infection that expands from their lungs to other parts of their body, including their skin, bones, joints, or brain, and 5 to 10 percent may experience severe or permanent lung difficulties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While many patients can recover on their own in a few weeks or months without therapy, some may need treatment, hospitalisation and antifungal medication for more severe infections.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 14:08:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>马拉松和其他极限跑步是否与结肠癌有关？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE1Lb21CQ240QlJSRk5OUlBYMWJwY0xBT2luajdSLW9Oc1BQNFpPeUF6VUpEaEhhVHpTZ1FnMEx2UFR0cXFVdm9XWGdRRVNvSlB4V2llRHd6ZHhieHhPUENwNXh2ek5nRVctOUU4LXVEUnBXTWFscnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 14:00:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1Lb21CQ240QlJSRk5OUlBYMWJwY0xBT2luajdSLW9Oc1BQNFpPeUF6VUpEaEhhVHpTZ1FnMEx2UFR0cXFVdm9XWGdRRVNvSlB4V2llRHd6ZHhieHhPUENwNXh2ek5nRVctOUU4LXVEUnBXTWFscnc</guid></item></channel></rss>
