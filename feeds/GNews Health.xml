The team ran tests on both &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_softening"&gt;soft water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_water"&gt;hard tap water&lt;/a&gt; (which is richer in minerals).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added in nanoplastics and microplastics before boiling the liquid and then filtering out any precipitates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-food-packaging-is-shedding-microplastics-into-every-meal-study-reveals"&gt;Your Food Packaging Is Shedding Microplastics Into Every Meal, Study Reveals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tap water nano/microplastics (NMPs) escaping from centralized water treatment systems are of increasing global concern, because they pose potential health risks to humans via water consumption," &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00081"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the researchers &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00081"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, up to 90 percent of the NMPs were removed by the boiling and filtering process, though the effectiveness varied based on the type of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course the huge benefit is that most people can do it with what they already have in their kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This simple boiling water strategy can 'decontaminate' NMPs from household tap water and has the potential for harmlessly alleviating human intake of NMPs through water consumption," &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00081"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; biomedical engineer Zimin Yu from Guangzhou Medical University and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A greater concentration of NMPs was removed from samples of hard tap water, which naturally forms a buildup of limescale (or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_carbonate"&gt;calcium carbonate&lt;/a&gt;) as it is heated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commonly seen inside kitchen kettles, the chalky substance forms on the plastic's surface as changes in temperature force the calcium carbonate out of solution, effectively trapping the plastic fragments in a crust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results showed that nanoplastic precipitation efficiency increased with increasing water hardness upon boiling," the team &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00081"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For example, from 34 percent at 80 mg L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to 84 percent and 90 percent at 180 and 300 mg L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of calcium carbonate, respectively."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in soft water, where less calcium carbonate is dissolved, roughly a quarter of the NMPs were snagged from the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any bits of lime-encrusted plastic could then be removed through a simple filter like the stainless steel mesh used to strain tea, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004565352030686X"&gt;Past studies&lt;/a&gt; have measured fragments of polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate in potable tap water, which we're consuming daily in varying quantities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144609" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144609" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AbstractGraphicRemovingNMPFromTapWater.jpg" alt="Graphic depicting boiling water to remove NMPs" class="size-full wp-image-144609" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AbstractGraphicRemovingNMPFromTapWater.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AbstractGraphicRemovingNMPFromTapWater-600x257.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144609" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This simple boiling water strategy can 'decontaminate' NMPs from household tap water.

As &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;senior fitness writer, I interview experts weekly in an attempt to cut through this noise and bring readers accessible, effective tips that benefit their &lt;a href="/news/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter which expert I’m speaking to, there are several underlying features of a nutritious adult &lt;a href="/topic/diet"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; that remain largely undisputed: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-1k7glnk-1 dDVXDN irZnNR"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat a wide variety of plant-based foods including plenty of vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose wholefoods where possible &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus on hitting fibre requirements – at least 30g per day &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consume adequate protein from lean sources&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foods with excessive saturated fat and added sugar should form only a small portion of your diet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consume an appropriate number of calories for your build and activity levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were to follow this advice consistently, chances are your health would be in a pretty positive place. Add regular &lt;a href="/topic/exercise"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; into the mix and you’re running in the right direction. But there are other key tips that have stayed with me in 2025 – which I have compiled for you below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prioritise nutritious foods you can add to your diet &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Appetite is finite,” &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FEverything-Fat-Loss-Definitive-Bullsh%2Fdp%2FB0BT733QD8%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C2883459%7CB0BT733QD8%7Cindependentcouk_web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything Fat Loss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; author and experienced trainer Ben Carpenter tells me. “I like focusing on adding nutritious foods into your diet because they tend to displace other foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, one study Carpenter cites found that children encouraged to eat more apples – a food rich in nutrients and high in fibre – actually lowered their daily caloric intake. The fruit had elbowed other less nutritious, energy-dense food out of the picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says most people have a good idea what is meant by nutritious food, but adds that opting for items that “tend to be slightly less processed” is a good rule of thumb to follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, fruits and vegetables, lean proteins [white fish, white meat, soy, tofu], beans, lentils and wholegrains,” Carpenter lists. “Even things like rice and oats as opposed to donuts, pancakes and waffles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/bold-bean-co-gut-health-recipes-b2842333.html"&gt;How fibremaxxing became the secret to better gut-health and easy recipes to use now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bHmhpR"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/20/8/43/iStock-2150137406.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/20/8/43/iStock-2150137406.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/20/8/43/iStock-2150137406.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Incorporating more nutritious foods in your diet can displace more energy-dense, less nutritious alternatives" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-519624"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Incorporating more nutritious foods in your diet can displace more energy-dense, less nutritious alternatives&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Balance wins over ultra-extreme every time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From carnivore to keto, extreme diets will continue to grab headlines – yet the definition of diet isn’t something short-term, but rather the foods you habitually eat. By this logic, it makes sense to stick with something sustainable and health-promoting, rather than following an unmanageably restrictive regime for a few weeks before inevitably falling back into old habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather than being ultra-extreme, focus on balance,” advises &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/eating-a-balanced-diet/"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; GP Dr Radha Modgil. “One of the big things we can all do is look at how many fruits and vegetables we’re eating each day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They don’t have to be fresh, they can be canned, dried or frozen, but the evidence shows that if we at least eat our five a day, we have a lower risk of heart disease, stroke and some cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Modgil points to the NHS’s Eatwell Guide as an example of how to structure a balanced diet. It recommends that a third of the food we eat should be fruit and vegetables, another third should be starchy foods high in fibre such as wholegrains, then the remainder should comprise items such as beans, pulses, lean protein sources and dairy (or dairy alternatives). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods such as chocolate, cakes, biscuits, sugary soft drinks, butter and ice cream are non-essential additions to your diet, “so should be eaten less often and in smaller amounts”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 kSPTgz"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/05/22/15/eatwell-guide.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/05/22/15/eatwell-guide.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/05/22/15/eatwell-guide.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="NHS GP Dr Radha Modgil says the Eatwell Guide provides a good template for constructing a healthy meal and wider diet" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-519625"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;NHS GP Dr Radha Modgil says the Eatwell Guide provides a good template for constructing a healthy meal and wider diet&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Public Health England)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-reduce-diabetes-risk-b2878819.html"&gt;What the shape of your buttock muscles might mean for your future health – and how to change it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alter your food environment &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human body and brain like to take the path of least resistance, particularly when your schedule becomes hectic. If you can make healthy options more practical, you drastically increase your chance of choosing them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to do this. Preparing your lunches in advance is the most obvious, stopping you from splashing the cash on fast food during office days. But there are other quick things you can do that will push your eating habits in a positive direction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooking up a lean protein source like a chicken or block of tofu at the start of your week, then having it in your fridge, can make it easier to whip up nutritious meals when you’re short on time in the evenings. Having fruit on your desk in the office can encourage smarter snacking, while placing nutritious snacks such as carrots and hummus in compartments at the front of your fridge or cupboard means you can mindlessly graze on these nourishing foods with minimal effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One final tip is omitting products high in saturated fat and added sugars – such as crisps and chocolate – from your weekly food shop, meaning you have to leave the house and buy them if you want to eat them. Putting an extra hurdle between you and the action you’re looking to cut back on makes you less likely to do it, and if you do pop to the shops you’ll be adding a bit of extra movement into your day – a win-win. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/exercise-snacking-workouts-heart-health-b2859776.html"&gt;The science-backed two-minute daily workouts for improving heart health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dywRpZ"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/03/14/14/iStock-883982334.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/03/14/14/iStock-883982334.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/03/14/14/iStock-883982334.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Preparing nutritious meals in advance can make healthy choices easier to take later in the week" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-519626"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Preparing nutritious meals in advance can make healthy choices easier to take later in the week&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Focus on fibre as well as protein &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both protein and fibre are essential,” says Dr Karan Rajan, a surgeon and author of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FThis-Book-Save-Your-Life-ebook%2Fdp%2FB0BY1R4D7V%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C2883459%7CB0BY1R4D7V%7Cindependentcouk_web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Book May Save Your Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “There are plenty of foods and meal combos where you can get both, but if I had to over-index on one, it would be fibre. I’d say the average person probably consumes enough protein and nowhere near enough fibre.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-diet-and-nutrition-survey-2019-to-2023/national-diet-and-nutrition-survey-2019-to-2023-report"&gt;National Diet and Nutrition Survey&lt;/a&gt;, 96 per cent of UK adults are falling shy of their 30g daily fibre requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it comes to human physiology, there [aren’t many processes that] fibre isn’t involved in, either directly or indirectly,” Dr Rajan continues. “Its benefits include regulating hormones, metabolism, appetite, the gut microbiome, mood, bowels and more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibre can be found in plant-based foods such as lentils, beans and peas, as well as wholegrains such as oats and barley, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is also important, playing a role in many bodily processes such as building and repairing tissues (including, most notably, muscle) and supporting immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The recommended nutrient intake for protein in the UK is 0.75 grams per kilogram of body weight,” says &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/javier-gonzalez"&gt;Professor Javier Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of nutrition and metabolism at the University of Bath’s Centre for Nutrition, Exercise and Metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are some good arguments that a little higher than this – up to 1.2g/kg – may have additional benefits for muscle health and weight control. The requirements of athletes can be even higher than this – up to around 1.8g/kg.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most experts I speak to argue that the majority of people are already consuming enough protein. However, as Dr Gonzalez explains above, those who exercise may benefit from a slightly higher daily intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, Nichola Ludlam-Raine, a specialist registered dietitian and author of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FHow-Not-Eat-Ultra-Processed-life-changing%2Fdp%2F1529940117%2Fref%3Dasc_df_1529940117%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C2846584%7C1529940117%7Cindependentcouk_web"&gt;How Not to Eat Ultra-Processed&lt;/a&gt;, recommends aiming to include both protein and fibre in your snack choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think apple and cheese, berries and yoghurt, carrots and hummus, or nuts and dried fruit,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/food-and-drink/features/ultra-processed-food-lancet-medical-journal-b2868062.html"&gt;The five ultra-processed food ingredients to avoid on packaging – and what to buy instead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 laKbvU"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/30/09/houmous.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/30/09/houmous.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/30/09/houmous.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Dietitian Nichola Ludlam-Raine recommends aiming to include both fibre and protein in your snacks – for example, carrots and hummus" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-519627"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Dietitian Nichola Ludlam-Raine recommends aiming to include both fibre and protein in your snacks – for example, carrots and hummus&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eat your CAP&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/gut-health-nutrition-diet-b2789919.html"&gt;Gut health&lt;/a&gt; is a buzz term in the fitness industry right now. Fermented items such as kimchi, &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/kombucha-drink-health-benefits-scoby-equinox-b2848346.html"&gt;kombucha&lt;/a&gt; and sauerkraut are widely seen as the key to a more settled stomach – something that plugs into a huge range of systems in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Johnny Drain, a fermentation expert and author of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FAdventures-Fermentation-Culinary-Frontiers-Exploration%2Fdp%2F0241699134%2Fref%3Dasc_df_0241699134%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C2765194%7C0241699134%7Cindependentcouk_web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adventures in Fermentation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, says his golden rule for gut health is to “eat your CAP” – an acronym for “colourful array of plant-based foods”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are associations between a more diverse gut microbiome and improved mood and cognition, improved mental health, improved immune function and improved digestion,” Dr Drain explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Humans are essentially a tube – you put something in at the top and other stuff comes out of the bottom. The game is getting as many nutrients from it as possible in the process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microbes in our gut help us extract nutrients from the food we eat. Research, such as this 2023 study from the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2023-12-15-study-shows-diverse-gut-bacteria-communities-protect-against-harmful-pathogens"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, suggests improved gut microbiome diversity is associated with better health outcomes, and vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People that have some diseases, such as metabolic diseases, might have a less diverse microbiome,” explains Dr Drain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Gut Health (or Microsetta Initiative) study showed that consuming 30 or more different plant foods per week can increase gut microbiome diversity, and consequently gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These foods include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds and even herbs and spices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of fermented foods with live cultures such as kefir, live yoghurt, sauerkraut, kimchi and miso has also been associated with positive impacts on gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-healthy-habits-every-day-b2837119.html"&gt;Do these five things daily for 90 days to see a ‘profound difference’ in your health, fitness and energy levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 gFcOVD"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/16/17/25/iStock-2233021362.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/16/17/25/iStock-2233021362.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/16/17/25/iStock-2233021362.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Fermented foods such as kimchi can contribute to a more diverse gut microbiome and improved gut health" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-519628"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Fermented foods such as kimchi can contribute to a more diverse gut microbiome and improved gut health&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Know where to find polyphenols&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyphenols are plant-based dietary compounds found in a wide variety of foods and drinks, from berries to green tea to dark chocolate. They overlap heavily with fibre, although emerging research points towards these compounds having health perks in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Rajan, they have anti-inflammatory properties, they can improve cardiometabolic function and they support endothelial function (related to the lining of the blood vessels). Polyphenols may also aid lipid modulation and directly impact gut microbiome health, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A review article, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163725000790"&gt;Ageing Research Reviews&lt;/a&gt; journal in 2025, also pointed towards polyphenols having anti-ageing effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where can you find them? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-1k7glnk-1 dDVXDN irZnNR"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Berries – especially blueberries, blackberries and strawberries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cocoa and dark chocolate – 70 per cent cocoa or higher&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Green tea and coffee &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grapes and red wine – “Though alcohol obviously has downsides for gut health and it is more generally linked to increased risk of cancers, so grapes are better,” says Dr Rajan &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apples and pears &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turmeric – curcumin is the active compound – and other herbs and spices &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Olive oil &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts such as almonds or walnuts &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Onions and garlic &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than targeting specific polyphenols in the supermarket, Dr Rajan recommends shaping your wider diet to include several sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A Mediterranean-style diet is naturally rich in polyphenols,” he says. “Small daily choices, like opting for black coffee, snacking on a couple of squares of dark chocolate, eating some mixed berries and having olive oil with meals, will add up over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/diet-and-exercise-advice-for-longevity-b2833750.html"&gt;Scientists reveal the small lifestyle changes that can reduce your risk of heart disease and add 10 years to your life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-awdjp1-0 eFcuEG"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/22/14/iStock-1337021714.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/22/14/iStock-1337021714.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/22/14/iStock-1337021714.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Blueberries, almonds and dark chocolate all contain polyphenols" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-519629"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Blueberries, almonds and dark chocolate all contain polyphenols&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prioritise wholefoods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed food (UPF) is another phrase that has hit the mainstream in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Chris van Tulleken, a professor of global health and infection at University College London, and author of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=3658&amp;amp;platform=independentcouk_web&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FUltra-Processed-People-Stuff-That-Isnt%2Fdp%2F1529900050%3Fascsubtag%3DIN%7C2883459%7C1529900050%7Cindependentcouk_web"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ultra-Processed People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, applies the working definition: “If the packaging you are reading has an ingredient that you don’t typically find in a domestic kitchen, like an emulsifier or a flavouring, then it’s very likely to be an ultra-processed food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of UPF continues to stir up debate, but a systematic review published in &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/ultra-processed-food"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt; medical journal this year detailed a link between UPF consumption and non-communicable diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can find a way of eating real food, we’re very sure that’s better for you,” says van Tulleken. “You don’t have to believe any of the evidence around ultra-processed food to say that’s true – that’s established in nutrition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, he recommends asking yourself a simple question before you buy or eat any food and drink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Was this food prepared with the purpose of protecting my health and nourishing me? If the answer to that question is no, then I think you should contemplate if you want to eat it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Count your drinks in your diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we drink is often seen as separate diet, but everything we put in our body will have some sort of impact – large or small, positive or negative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Water is always the healthiest option of any drink,” says Dr Modgil. “Our brains are nearly 80 per cent water, so it’s something we obviously need to stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to drink regularly throughout the day and avoid sugary drinks.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes the usual suspect such as energy drinks and fizzy drinks, as well as limiting fruit juices and smoothies to one small glass per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though there is fruit in there, they are still quite high in sugar,” Dr Modgil explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other small changes you can make include adding less sugar to your tea and coffee, and drinking alcohol in moderation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current guidelines are 14 units per week,” says neuropsychopharmacologist and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com/?cuid=xid:fr1765816255343fda&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fsentiaspirits.com%2Fpages%2Fabout&amp;amp;articleId=b2846549&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;Sentia&lt;/a&gt; co-founder Professor David Nutt. “If you can stick within those, the harms of alcohol are relatively minor.

And don’t stockpile. If you’re going to try and stick to the 14 units, don’t take them in one go because that’s going to be more deleterious to your brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/food-and-drink/features/food-inflation-rising-why-climate-change-meat-price-b2868901.html"&gt;Inflation is down – so why is your food shop getting even more expensive?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQWUNQUmlwR2QwY01UbFpOeHJzV2FYVngxQVg0Qm0weHhFYnZ2WURLMGI2QkNUV1c0ZXJfVlJxQWNISmdzQTBiTEw3Njg1eDZtVnFVYzF0WWFPMkRvT051RGE0UXBySXlWV25aY2k2OFF1RUlYcTFkbFByR1lGNk1lNEhoS3FSRVF0X0R3dnRLUUVOLWYxZ0QzOUpwbks2ZHlQQ2h5YjN1WQ</guid></item><item><title>专家质疑丹麦的疫苗计划是美国的典范--《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/29/world/europe/denmark-vaccine-schedule-rfk.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:01:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPQ285OFRBTWFqUmZXVU96T21kcWFjNXhzdHVBQUNGUmxZNndIRXZVZE5WOGh3ZmVhSjY1R1JXUTJvOHRaS3NJVTJFYWpMNVZMQ0s3eGp6cHFsaERmbkQ5clRyOFlzWEtDNVY4MmFuRmlQLVVqcnhNQUVBN29JTlZac0x2RkhFY2VK</guid></item><item><title>Kratom和7-OH产品可广泛使用。它们也是公共卫生辩论的核心。：短波- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/12/29/nx-s1-5633323/kratom-fda-drug-addictive-opioids</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Kratom and 7-OH products are available in many smoke shops. Some people use them instead of opioids. Others say they're addictive – and should be better regulated.

They're available in many smoke shops, but the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-steps-restrict-7-oh-opioid-products-threatening-american-consumers" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Drug Administration says&lt;/a&gt; certain products are highly addictive — and could lead to the next wave of the opioid epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time kratom has come under scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nearly a decade ago, the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, &lt;a href="https://www.dea.gov/press-releases/2016/08/30/dea-announces-intent-schedule-kratom" target="_blank"&gt;wanted to classify&lt;/a&gt; the active ingredients in kratom in the same category as heroin. That meant products would have gone from being widely available to highly&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;restricted.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Following the announcement, there was a massive wave of protest from advocates and lawmakers — including people who said they used kratom products to wean themselves off opioids.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The DEA decided not to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Today on the show, we dive into what could happen with the FDA's scheduling change, and what researchers do – and don't – know about kratom and 7-OH.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interested in more of the science behind drugs and supplements?

So it is critical to identify it early, right during the process of artery blockage. Let's take a closer look at a related condition called atherosclerosis, where plaque builds up inside the arteries. This subsequently leads to blocked arteries, which reduce or stop blood flow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Saurabh Juneja, Director &amp;amp; HOD, Cardiology, ISIC Multi-Speciality Hospital, shared with HT Lifestyle how one can detect it early.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;He explained the condition, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Atherosclerosis is a formidable and often silent adversary, a chronic condition characterised by the gradual hardening and narrowing of arteries due to the build-up of plaque.” This condition is progressive in nature, and the cardiologist noted that the initial stages are usually asymptomatic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also shared how this condition leads to blocked arteries, “&lt;span&gt;Atherosclerosis is a progressive disease that typically begins with damage to the inner lining of an artery. The damage initiates an inflammatory response, leading to the accumulation of plaque. As plaque continues to grow, it stiffens and narrows the arteries, impeding the smooth flow of blood.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why is atherosclerosis a ‘silent killer’?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Juneja flagged this condition as a ‘silent killer' as it can grow slowly in the body for years without showing any visible symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later on, it appears only after significant damage has already occurred, often without the individual being aware. The cardiologist warned of major emergencies such as heart attacks, strokes and severe cardiovascular conditions. This happens as eventually the artery becomes narrowed or completely blocked. It is alarming, as Dr Juneja remarked, one can live for decades without any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Risk factors and vulnerable groups&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some lifestyle and pre-existing factors that make a person more likely to develop this condition. Dr Juneja listed the risk factors:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;High cholesterol (particularly high LDL, "bad" cholesterol)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Smoking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Diabetes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Obesity and physical inactivity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unhealthy diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, certain groups of people are more vulnerable to developing atherosclerosis. Dr Juneja outlined these groups, making it important for individuals in them to be especially vigilant about presentation and early detection:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals with metabolic conditions:&lt;/strong&gt; Those diagnosed with hypertension, dyslipidemia (high cholesterol), or diabetes are at a substantially elevated risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smokers&lt;/strong&gt;: Tobacco use is one of the most potent risk factors, directly damaging arterial walls and accelerating plaque formation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals with unhealthy lifestyles: &lt;/strong&gt;Sedentary habits and diets rich in saturated/trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium contribute significantly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Older age: &lt;/strong&gt;The risk of atherosclerosis increases with age, typically becoming more prevalent after 45 for men and 55 for women.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family history:&lt;/strong&gt; A strong family history of early heart disease or stroke indicates a genetic predisposition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic inflammatory conditions: &lt;/strong&gt;Conditions like chronic kidney disease and certain autoimmune diseases can also heighten susceptibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Since this condition is asymptomatic in its early stages, it is vital to stay on top of your health and undergo regular tests. Dr Juneja recommended these tests, especially for those with multiple risk factors, a family history of heart diseases or for people over the age of 40:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood tests:&lt;/strong&gt; Cholesterol panel (lipid profile), blood sugar, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood pressure monitoring: &lt;/strong&gt;Regular checks are essential for identifying hypertension.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI):&lt;/strong&gt; A simple test comparing blood pressure in the ankle to that in the arm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carotid ultrasound: &lt;/strong&gt;Visualises plaque buildup in the neck arteries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) score: &lt;/strong&gt;A CT scan measuring calcium deposits in heart arteries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMT (Treadmill Test) / Stress Echo: &lt;/strong&gt;These tests assess heart function under stress to detect blockages in coronary arteries that might not be apparent at rest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;A large Swedish &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214343?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; reported a lower risk of dementia among middle-aged and older adults who consumed higher amounts of full-fat cheese and cream. The findings may sound like welcome news but they need careful interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study followed 27,670 participants for 25 years, during which 3,208 developed &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/dementia-283"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among people without a known genetic risk for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="186945" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, eating more than 50 grams of full-fat cheese per day was associated with a 13%–17% lower risk of Alzheimer's. No such reduction was seen among people who carried genetic risk factors for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-drug-stalls-alzheimers-development-in-breakthrough-trial"&gt;New Drug Stalls Alzheimer's Development in Breakthrough Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming more than 20 grams of full-fat cream per day was linked to a 16%–24% lower risk of dementia overall. No associations were found for low-fat or high-fat milk, fermented or non-fermented milk, or low-fat cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are notable given longstanding public &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/milk-and-dairy-nutrition/"&gt;health advice&lt;/a&gt; to choose low-fat dairy to reduce cardiovascular risk. This matters because heart disease and dementia share many risk factors, including high blood pressure,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="186945" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When evidence from previous studies is combined, analyses suggest that cheese consumption may also be linked to a lower risk of heart disease, and that full-fat dairy does not necessarily increase cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other studies have explored whether similar patterns apply to brain health, but the results are mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186949" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186949" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/TwoPeopleDrinkingTakeawayCoffeesorMilkshakes-642x361.jpg" alt="Two young adults enjoying takeaway drinks on a bench outdoors" class="size-medium wp-image-186949" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/TwoPeopleDrinkingTakeawayCoffeesorMilkshakes-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/TwoPeopleDrinkingTakeawayCoffeesorMilkshakes-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/TwoPeopleDrinkingTakeawayCoffeesorMilkshakes-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/TwoPeopleDrinkingTakeawayCoffeesorMilkshakes.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186949" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;No need to add extra cream… (FatCamera/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38043604/"&gt;overall&lt;/a&gt; suggests that studies conducted in Asian populations are more likely to report benefits of dairy consumption for cognitive health, while many European studies do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation is that average dairy intake tends to be much lower in Asian countries, meaning modest consumption may have different effects than higher intakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, one Japanese study reported a reduced dementia risk among people who ate cheese, but overall consumption levels were very low and the research was sponsored by a cheese producer. In contrast, another &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37335358/"&gt;Japanese study&lt;/a&gt; funded by government grants found no protective effect of cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some long-term European studies have also reported benefits. In a Finnish &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-022-02834-x"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 2,497 middle-aged men followed for 22 years, cheese was the only food associated with a lower dementia risk, reduced by 28%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumption of milk and processed red meat was linked to poorer performance on cognitive tests, while fish consumption was associated with better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-022-00615-2"&gt;UK study&lt;/a&gt; following nearly 250,000 people found that eating fish two to four times a week, fruit daily and cheese once a week was associated with lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these studies have important limitations. What people eat is usually self-reported, and changes in memory can affect both eating habits and how accurately people remember what they have eaten. To deal with this, the Swedish researchers took two extra steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, they excluded anyone who already had dementia when the study began. Then they repeated the same calculations after removing people who went on to develop dementia within the first ten years of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This did not mean starting the study again or recruiting new participants. It simply meant re-checking the results using a smaller group of people who remained dementia-free for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for doing this is that the early stages of dementia can subtly change behaviour long before diagnosis. People may eat differently, lose their appetite, or struggle to recall their usual diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By focusing on participants who stayed cognitively healthy for many years, the researchers reduced the chance that these early changes were influencing the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important question is whether substitution played a role. Some of the apparent benefits may reflect replacing red or processed meat with cheese or cream, rather than an effect of dairy itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting this idea, the Swedish study found no association between full-fat dairy and dementia risk among participants whose diets remained stable over five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, foods should not be considered in isolation. Dietary patterns matter more than individual ingredients. Diets such as the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-022-00615-2"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, which is consistently associated with lower risks of both dementia and heart disease, include cheese alongside vegetables, fish, whole grains, and fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186951" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186951" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-642x361.jpg" alt="Flatlay of various fresh healthy foods" class="size-medium wp-image-186951" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186951" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Eating a healthy, varied diet can help protect brain health. (AlexRaths/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Swedish study, people who consumed more full-fat cheese and cream were also more educated, less likely to be overweight, and had lower rates of conditions linked to dementia, including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and diabetes. All of these factors independently reduce dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that higher cheese intake tended to occur within healthier overall lifestyles, rather than alongside excess calorie consumption or poor metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-6-key-depression-symptoms-that-predict-dementia-risk"&gt;Scientists Identify 6 Key Depression Symptoms That Predict Dementia Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the evidence does not support the idea that full-fat dairy causes dementia, nor that fermented milk products reliably protect against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full-fat cheese contains several nutrients relevant to brain health, including fat-soluble  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="186945" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; A, D, and K2, as well as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="186945" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; B12, folate, iodine, zinc, and selenium. These nutrients play roles in neurological function and may help support cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the data do not justify eating large amounts of cheese or cream as protective foods against dementia or heart disease. The most consistent message remains that balanced diets, moderation, and overall lifestyle matter far more than any single item on the cheese board.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/272138/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/eef-hogervorst-1283596"&gt;Eef Hogervorst&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Biological Psychology, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/loughborough-university-1336"&gt;Loughborough University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Snacking before bed is fine—if you pick sleep-friendly foods like nuts, yogurt, oats, or tart cherries that curb hunger and support restful sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nutrients like fiber, magnesium, tryptophan, and melatonin can boost sleep quality while keeping you satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skip sugar, alcohol, caffeine, and heavy or spicy foods at night, as they can disrupt sleep and digestion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s all too common to feel &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/stop-late-night-cravings-11836290" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nagging hunger pangs&lt;/a&gt; in the hours between dinner and bedtime. Unfortunately, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/heart-healthy-snacks-for-late-night-cravings-11777163" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nighttime snacks and drinks&lt;/a&gt; often have a not-so-healthy reputation—it’s easy to reach for the most convenient (and crave-worthy) options after a day of making nutritious choices. While those late-night treats may be delicious, some can interfere with sleep quality and leave you feeling unsatisfied. That’s a frustrating double whammy, especially since good sleep is a cornerstone of overall health and wellness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news? Needing a snack before bed isn’t a problem—with the right choices, a nighttime snack can be both satisfying and nourishing. Here, experts share some delicious, healthy options that curb hunger and support restful sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-optimal-nutrients-for-healthy-nighttime-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Optimal Nutrients for Healthy Nighttime Snacks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Foods with these nutrients aren’t just healthy for you, but also support a good night’s rest—so they’re perfect healthy night snacks. When midnight hunger comes knocking, reach for:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fiber supports optimal health&lt;/a&gt; by regulating the blood sugar response, lowering cholesterol levels, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-to-help-you-poop-11769125" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;encouraging healthy digestion&lt;/a&gt;, increasing satiety after eating (ideal for evening snacks!), and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-gut-health-11833113" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;supporting the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. A thriving gut microbiome supports the immune system, brain health, and several other body systems. And interestingly enough, a &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/fo/d2fo01178f" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; showed that fiber’s positive impact on the microbiome may be linked to better sleep by supporting the gut-brain axis and reducing symptoms of several sleep disorders. &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-fiber-foods-11690551" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;Fiber is found largely in plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt; including fruits, veggies, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Magnesium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most common dietary supplements for those with sleep troubles is magnesium. “Magnesium, found in nuts, seeds, spinach, and tart cherry juice, may improve sleep quality so that you feel more rested and may help you fall asleep faster,” says Bianca Tamburello, RDN. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35184264/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;2023 review&lt;/a&gt; on this key mineral supports these benefits. Though further research is warranted, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/foods-high-in-magnesium" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; are undoubtedly healthy additions to your after-dinner snack, too, as they promote better bone, heart, and metabolic health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ever elusive &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-get-more-vitamin-d-11807401" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D is essential&lt;/a&gt; for optimal immune, heart, metabolic, and bone health, but emerging research is also finding it to be &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/vitamins-for-better-sleep-8660402" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;super beneficial for sleep&lt;/a&gt;. This is thanks to a handful of proposed mechanisms, including: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D’s role in serotonin and melatonin production that are essential to healthy circadian rhythms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D receptors on the brain stem that play an important role in sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D’s impact on certain pain disorders (like &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.994545/full" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;restless leg syndrome&lt;/a&gt;) that may negatively impact sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These impacts have been found in a multitude of studies, but are well summarized in this &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8912284/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;2022 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; published in Nutrients. Some great dietary sources of vitamin D include cod liver oil, salmon, swordfish, tuna, sardines, beef liver, egg yolk, fortified orange juice, fortified dairy and plant milks, and fortified cereals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Omega-3 Fatty Acids &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Research shows that omega-3 supplementation &lt;a href="https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2021/01/28/Study-says-omega-3-supplements-improve-sleep-in-people-with-low-fish-consumption" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;may improve sleep&lt;/a&gt; for those eating few omega-3 rich foods,” Tamburello says. This could be thanks to the fatty acid’s role in melatonin regulation. “Eating more &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;foods high in omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt; like salmon, walnuts, and chia seeds, may improve sleep by promoting higher melatonin levels,” she adds. Plus, omega-3s promote heart, brain, and immune health, among many other impressive benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Antioxidants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Antioxidant-rich micronutrients like plant compounds, vitamin E, and vitamin C are also food additions to a bedtime snack. They help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/anti-inflammatory-foods-11684448" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, promoting overall health and immunity, while also aiding in pain alleviation that may interfere with quality shut-eye. Foods especially high in antioxidants include berries, citrus fruit, leafy greens, beets, nuts, seeds, and whole grains—though most plant-based foods contain at least some.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Tryptophan &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’ve all heard the common trope that the &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/tryptophan-foods-6823810" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tryptophan found in turkey&lt;/a&gt; is to blame for the Thanksgiving nap many of us take after the big meal. And as it turns out, some of this may be true. “Tryptophan, which is often associated with turkey, but also found in dairy, chicken, and fish, can help &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/mind-mood/mood-boosting-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;boost serotonin&lt;/a&gt; levels to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33942088/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;positively impact sleep&lt;/a&gt;,” Tamburello explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Melatonin &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Melatonin is a hormone produced naturally by the body to promote sleep, but can also be found as a supplement and in foods including tart cherry juice, walnuts, almonds, oats, and grapes,” Tamburello says. And there’s plenty of evidence to back this up, with research pointing to its role in improving symptoms of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36064286/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sleep disorders&lt;/a&gt;, while also helping you to fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walnuts are packed with sleep-promoting &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-omega-3-11695043" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, while both almonds and walnuts are filled with fiber, antioxidants, melatonin, and magnesium—plus a bit of plant protein, too. These nutritional perks will encourage overall health, satiety, and sleep. Plus, if you opt for lightly salted nuts, it can help to curb your salty cravings after dinner.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The satisfying sweetness of a smoothie bowl is perfect after dinner. Smoothies are also an ideal vehicle for sleep-inducing additions like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/tart-cherry-benefits" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tart cherries&lt;/a&gt; (or tart cherry juice), frozen berries, grapes, and even oats.

This is due to its omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D. Salmon from Chile is especially beneficial in this regard as it is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25108414/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;particularly high&lt;/a&gt; in omega-3s. Smoked salmon is nothing short of a *chef’s kiss* when served on whole wheat crackers with a swipe of cream cheese and a sprinkle of fresh dill.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overnight oats can save the day at night—not just at breakfast time. They contain omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin, magnesium, fiber, and antioxidants found in ingredients like oats and chia seeds. Top with berries and a splash of milk to help with those sugar cravings.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The tryptophan found in turkey (and chicken!) will help you have a more complete night’s sleep, making turkey roll-ups the perfect slightly salty nighttime snack. Roll up nitrate-free, low-sodium deli turkey with lettuce, tomato, your condiments of choice, and maybe a slice of cheese.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The tryptophan and vitamin D found in yogurt, especially, will also promote healthy sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Crunchy foods are a common craving in the hours after dinner. High-fiber popcorn and protein-filled edamame are excellent choices, but don’t sleep on fresh-cut veggies and a satisfying dip. Dip them in vitamin D and tryptophan-rich cottage cheese to promote sleep and add an irresistibly savory bite. I top my cottage cheese with everything bagel seasoning for extra flavor. If you’re really not a cottage cheese fan, hummus, yogurt dip, or guacamole are delicious, savory, filling options too!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you need something truly zero-fuss—just a light, airy, crunchy bite—reach for a few handfuls of plain or lightly salted popcorn. This snack is technically a whole grain that'll provide a bit more fiber than other late-night, bagged snacks like potato chips or pretzels. Try a pre-bagged option from the grocery store that's easy on the sodium levels, made with little to no oils, and doesn't have any or much added sugar.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Believe it or not, cheese one of the simplest—and most delicious—ways to induce sleep when you're snacking before bed. Cheese contains tryptophan&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, an amino acid that carries sleep-regulating properties. Additionally, the calcium found in cheese mixes with tryptophan to produce melatonin—the sleep-inducing hormone. Seriously, think about all those times you felt a bit lethargic after eating from a cheese board; you weren't just imagining it!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

If you happen to be up late and your stomach's aching for a snack, consider whipping up an egg or two to satiate you (and lull you to sleep). Plus, it's a relatively easy meal to make when you're short on time and energy!

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the other side of the coin, there are certain &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-you-should-never-eat-before-bed-11684466" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods you should avoid before bed&lt;/a&gt; because they can disrupt nightly sleep or leave us still-hungry and lacking satisfying nutrients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol, high-sugar products, ultra-processed foods: &lt;/strong&gt;These include alcohol, ultra-processed foods, and added sugars. As pro-inflammatory agents, these foods can hurt sleep quality, potentially causing stomach upset, interfering with normal sleep patterns (as is the case with &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleepadvances/article/3/1/zpac023/6632721" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://mana.md/sugar-and-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;added sugar&lt;/a&gt;), or promoting spikes in energy, which added sugar tends to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/should-you-drink-coffee-before-bed-7255700" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Caffeine-rich drinks&lt;/a&gt; and foods—certain teas, coffee, energy drinks, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-caffeine-in-chocolate-8383422" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;chocolate&lt;/a&gt;—should also be approached with caution post-dinner, as caffeine is a stimulant that promotes stamina and wakefulness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spicy foods and high-saturated fat foods: &lt;/strong&gt;“Additionally, spicy foods and hard-to-digest high-fat foods can cause acid reflux if eaten too close to bedtime, interfering with healthy sleep patterns” Tamburello adds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you feel that you’re ravenous soon after dinner, it’s possible that you’re restricting too much,” Tamburello says. “For maximum nutrition and filling power, aim to make half your plate a fiber-rich veggie, a quarter of your plate a lean protein, and a quarter of your plate a whole grain or complex carbohydrate.” This winning combination of nutrients should &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/most-satiating-foods-8424198" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;leave you feeling satisfied&lt;/a&gt; well after you’ve finished your meal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/why-am-i-craving-sugar" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sugar cravings&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/why-do-i-crave-salt" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;salt cravings&lt;/a&gt; hit you at night, it’s important to look at the whole picture of your daily life—these cravings can be brought on by stress, habitually consuming higher amounts of these foods regularly, dehydration, and (ironically) poor sleep habits. The healthy snacks highlighted above should help to curb some of these cravings, while &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/mindfulness-activities-7555756" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;practicing mindfulness&lt;/a&gt; can be beneficial, too. The practice of mindfulness helps us tune into our bodies to determine whether we’re actually hungry, experiencing an empty craving, snacking out of a behavioral habit, or actually have another need, like drinking more water.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-whats-the-best-time-for-a-nightly-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What’s the Best Time for a Nightly Snack? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In terms of when the best time for a nighttime snack is, “some research suggests that eating &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9092657/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;four to six hours&lt;/a&gt; before bed is best to prevent digestion from interfering with sleep, while &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/nutrition/is-it-bad-to-eat-before-bed" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;other experts recommend&lt;/a&gt; eating up to 2 hours before bed,” Tamburello says. In other words, there are several schools of thought, and it really depends on you, your appetite, and other contextual factors. “The bottom line: If you’re hungry, you should eat something,” she says.

If your symptoms have reached the point where you’re turning to medication to feel better, you’re likely feeling pretty lousy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s often important to give the body the rest it needs to recover, other times, you just need the pain to go away so you can power through your day. After all, there’s probably a lot you want to get done. In these moments, you’re likely relying on your &lt;a href="https://parade.com/living/good-morning-memes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:morning;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;morning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-happens-when-you-drink-coffee-every-day" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cup of coffee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cup of coffee&lt;/a&gt; even more to help energize you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, not all medications are designed to work instantly, and most of us have been told again and again not to expect immediate relief. Many pain relievers, allergy meds, and even everyday supplements can take a while to absorb, which only adds to the frustration when you’re already dragging yourself through the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s why people get curious about anything that might make their medication kick in faster—whether it’s timing your dose with food, taking it on an empty stomach or pairing it with hydration. And since caffeine is already part of so many morning routines, it’s natural to wonder if that daily cup could give you a lift in more ways than one. Maybe you’ve even noticed moments where medication seems to “hit” you harder after your &lt;a href="https://parade.com/food/coffee-jokes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:latte;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;latte&lt;/a&gt; or espresso, making you question whether there’s something actually happening there instead of pure coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to hear the best news ever?

Dr. Mieses Malchuk explains that caffeine likely enhances ibuprofen’s ability to stop pain signals in the brain, and may specifically help ibuprofen work more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1093169757/sarah-m-bobker" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Sarah Bobker, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Sarah Bobker, MD,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a clinical associate professor in the NYU Grossman School of Medicine’s Division of Headache Medicine, says that it isn’t just coffee that can have this effect; anything with caffeine can. So if you’re not a coffee drinker, you can take your ibuprofen with caffeinated tea instead and get a similar result, although Dr. Bobker says that coffee has more caffeine than tea, so the impact won’t be as dramatic. She also points out that many pain relievers are formulated with caffeine, so taking one of these medications is another way to get the boosted benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-starbucks-protein-coffee-order-according-to-dietitian" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:'I'm a Registered Dietitian—Here's My Go-to Starbucks Protein Coffee Order';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;'I'm a Registered Dietitian—Here's My Go-to Starbucks Protein Coffee Order'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Does Food Impact Ibuprofen's Effectiveness?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of how other foods and drinks can impact ibuprofen, all three doctors say that there aren’t any specific foods that make the medication more or less effective. However, you may want to avoid taking it after a big meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Food does not specifically make ibuprofen less effective, but it may slow down ibuprofen's absorption. After a big meal, for example, it will take your stomach more time to digest everything inside. This can delay the positive effects of ibuprofen on your pain,” Dr. Bobker says. Dr. Mian says this too, explaining that fatty meals can especially make ibuprofen take longer to reach peak levels, meaning it would take longer to feel the effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, ibuprofen can be tough on your stomach, especially if taken regularly. Taking ibuprofen with food can help mitigate these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The One Drink You Shouldn’t Take Ibuprofen With&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one drink in particular that all three doctors warn against taking with ibuprofen: alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Taking ibuprofen with alcohol significantly increases the risk of bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract,” Dr. Mieses Malchuk says, explaining that common signs of a GI bleed include vomiting blood, black, tarry stools and maroon-colored blood streaked on your stool or from your rectum. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, you should see a doctor ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/never-combine-these-over-the-counter-medications-according-to-doctors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2 Over-The-Counter Medications You Should Never, Ever Combine, According to Doctors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2 Over-The-Counter Medications You Should Never, Ever Combine, According to Doctors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to increasing the risk of a GI bleed, Dr. Mian says that taking ibuprofen with alcohol puts added stress on the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/normal-pain-that-could-signal-kidney-issues" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kidneys;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;kidneys&lt;/a&gt;, which can be especially dangerous for older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself taking ibuprofen frequently, Dr. Mieses Malchuk recommends seeing your healthcare provider to make sure there isn’t a more serious underlying problem. While it’s okay to take ibuprofen occasionally, it shouldn’t be a regular habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, there’s nothing the body needs more than rest, and trying to power through your symptoms is only going to prolong your illness. But when it’s a headache, muscle aches, menstrual cramps or minor joint pain holding you back, taking ibuprofen with coffee may be just the trick to feeling better as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/medications-to-never-mix-with-multivitamins" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: 5 Medications You Should Never, Ever Mix With Your Multivitamins Without Talking to Your Doctor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: 5 Medications You Should Never, Ever Mix With Your Multivitamins Without Talking to Your Doctor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.usnews.com/doctors/fawad-mian-1236522" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Fawad Mian, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Fawad Mian, MD,&lt;/a&gt; neurologist and founder at &lt;a href="https://prolohealing.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ascend Regenerative;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ascend Regenerative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dralexamieses.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Alexa Mieses Malchuk, MD, MPH,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Alexa Mieses Malchuk, MD, MPH,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/1045384/marynliles/family-quotes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:family;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; medicine physician at Geisinger in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1093169757/sarah-m-bobker" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Sarah Bobker, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Sarah Bobker, MD,&lt;/a&gt; clinical associate professor in the NYU Grossman School of Medicine’s Division of Headache Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derry, S., Wiffen, P.J., Moore, R.A.

"He was a premature baby, but other than that, he’s had inhalers and stuff, but that’s been years ago," she said. "He was telling everybody he was fine, he felt fine. And then, I guess he started throwing up that night and had a seizure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Watkins was a fifth-grade student at Hueytown Intermediate School.

Days later, he had a seizure and was taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The page said, at one point, Watkins was placed on a ventilator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sabrina made an emotional &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1DPnM6A6VL/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Facebook;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; post on Dec. 28, writing, "I just want to say..

    &lt;p&gt;Ancient scientists can be easy to dismiss. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greek philosopher &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus"&gt;Thales of Miletus&lt;/a&gt;, often described as the West’s first scientist, believed the whole Earth was suspended on water. Roman encyclopaedist &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder"&gt;Pliny the Elder&lt;/a&gt; recommended entrails, chicken brains, and mice cut in two as topical remedies for snakebite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lone ancient Greek thinker who believed Earth orbits the Sun – &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos"&gt;Aristarchus of Samos&lt;/a&gt; – was universally dismissed by his contemporaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because these scientific beliefs are so different from our own, it may seem we have nothing to learn from long-dead scientists. However, thinkers 2,500 years ago already faced many problems that are today amplified by social media and artificial intelligence (AI), such as how to tell truth from fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are five lessons from ancient Greek and Roman science that ring surprisingly true in the face of misinformation in the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Start with observations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every ancient scientific text offers advice about observing or collecting data before making a decision. For example, in a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomica_(Manilius)"&gt;1st century CE text&lt;/a&gt; about astronomy, author &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Manilius"&gt;Marcus Manilius&lt;/a&gt; explains that his scientific predecessors learned via detailed, long-term observations. He says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;they observed the appearance of the whole night sky and watched every star return to its original place […] by doing this repeatedly, they built up their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancient astronomers, Manilius says, would look around and gather evidence before drawing any conclusions. Greek and Roman scientists wanted their readers to do the same, and to be suspicious of any claims that are not backed up by data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Think critically&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancient scientists insisted their readers think critically, encouraging us to analyse the claims made by other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Aetna/text*.html"&gt;Aetna&lt;/a&gt; is an anonymous text that explains how volcanoes work. Its unknown author warns readers about two potential sources of misinformation: other authors and other people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether these groups intend to mislead their audiences or are simply misinformed, the book urges us to scrutinise their claims carefully and think about whether they are consistent with the evidence of our own senses and &lt;em&gt;ratio&lt;/em&gt; (the Latin term for the powers of reasoning).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancient scientists encourage us to think critically about information we read or hear, because even well-meaning sources are not always accurate. Writers like the Aetna author want us to think before accepting other people’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Acknowledge what you don’t know&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another skill ancient scientists encourage is acknowledging our limits. Even Greek and Roman scientists who claimed to be experts in their field frequently admitted they didn’t have all the answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://files.libertyfund.org/files/2242/Lucretius_1496_Bk.pdf"&gt;On the Nature of Things&lt;/a&gt;, Roman philosopher &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretius"&gt;Lucretius&lt;/a&gt; proposed three different explanations for solar eclipses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Moon passing in front of the Sun &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some other opaque body passing in front of the Sun, or &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Sun’s light temporarily growing dim for some reason. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucretius says he cannot determine which is more likely without additional evidence. In fact, he says it would be “unscientific” to eliminate any of these theories just for the sake of appearing more certain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple explanations seem unsatisfactory to us because they make ancient scientists’ theories seem less precise. Yet writers like Lucretius should be praised for their honesty in admitting they simply don’t have all the answers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greek and Roman scientists knew that people who claim they have no doubts can be very persuasive. However, as Lucretius demonstrates, a source that acknowledges its limits may actually be more trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Science is part of culture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ancient medical text from the school of Hippocrates called &lt;a href="https://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/sacred.html"&gt;On the Sacred Disease&lt;/a&gt; sought to explain the causes of epilepsy. Contrary to what the title might lead us to expect, the author argues vehemently that there is nothing “sacred” about epilepsy or any other illness, and is determined to discover its physical causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancient Greek doctors were divided on the causes of disease, and on whether they were supernatural or not. A patient might be given very different answers and advice depending on the perspective of the person they consulted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancient thinkers understood that science was part of culture rather than separate from it, and that an individual’s beliefs and values will have a significant impact on the information they promote as “factual” or “truthful”. Greek and Roman scientists remind us about this because they want readers to think about where information is coming from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Science is for everyone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Roman astronomer Manilius says the only essential for students of science is “a teachable mind”. In other words, the ability to acquire new knowledge is all about interest and willingness to learn, rather than possessing any innate skill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anonymous Aetna author says something similar: “Science is no place for genius.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancient scientists understood the importance of deferring to specialists and listening to expert advice. However, they were also keen for their readers to understand where scientists acquire knowledge and how scientific facts can be verified. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These hard-won lessons about how to figure what’s true and what’s not helped build the foundations of modern scientific knowledge – and they can still help us navigate a world where truth is just as slippery as it was for ancient Greeks and Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There's an unwritten rule in publishing, or so I've been told: Don't write about COVID. Our collective attention span has been saturated by those endless months holed up in attics and cramped corners of apartments, staring out at a world we could no longer take part in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the worst of it passed, we felt an urge to close that chapter, to padlock it behind a heavy latch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in doing so, we also tuck away the hard-won lessons of that time: how quickly systems buckle, how two decades of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/coronavirus-5830"&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; warnings &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2022.07.009"&gt;accumulated without adequate preparedness&lt;/a&gt;, and how the very mechanisms we rely on for safety can become the scaffolding of a next disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-first-death-from-h5n5-bird-flu-strain-reported-in-us"&gt;World's First Death From H5N5 Bird Flu Strain Reported in US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matters now as another threat is taking shape: highly pathogenic avian  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="186706" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt;, known as bird  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="186706" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bird flu still poses a low‑probability threat of sustained human transmission. But that doesn't make the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="186706" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The H5  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="186706" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.dw.com/en/virus-has-killed-almost-9-million-birds-and-counting/a-74972319"&gt;brutally lethal&lt;/a&gt; to birds – 9 million have died outright, and hundreds of millions have been culled to contain the spread. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/h5n1-bird-flu-cases-spike-in-europe-how-worried-should-we-be-269962"&gt;Alarming&lt;/a&gt; is the virus's expanding reach into mammals. So far, at least 74 mammal species, from elephant seals to polar bears, have suffered die‑offs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The individual cases are situated within a broader shift. Dense poultry farms create opportunities for the virus to hop species. Over a &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-virus-type-h5n1-us-dairy-cattle"&gt;thousand US dairy herds&lt;/a&gt; have tested positive in the past two years, and viral fragments have even been detected in milk – &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5600125/bird-flu-risk-outbreak-trump-administration"&gt;a worrying route&lt;/a&gt; of spillover. Every jump is a probe for new footholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe is &lt;a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/news/avian-influenza-europe-enhanced-surveillance-and-strict-biosecurity-needed-detections-surge?"&gt;seeing a surge too&lt;/a&gt;. From early September to mid-November 2025, 1,444 infected wild birds were found across 26 countries: a quadrupling compared with the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cases remain rare: only &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/influenza/h5n1-human-case-cumulative-table/cumulative-number-of-confirmed-human-cases-for-avian-influenza-a(h5n1)-reported-to-who--2003-2025ac90dee8-f1c4-4ff6-b891-f92e0df414cb.pdf?sfvrsn=447db8c4_3&amp;amp;download=true"&gt;992&lt;/a&gt; confirmed H5N1 infections worldwide since 2003, though with a near‑50% fatality rate. But the numbers are increasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Americas have logged 75 cases since 2022, and in November, the US recorded its &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj.r2480"&gt;first H5N5 death&lt;/a&gt; in a patient with existing health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186710" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186710" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/CowsOnADairyFarm-642x361.jpg" alt="Multiple cows on a dairy farm" class="wp-image-186710 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/CowsOnADairyFarm-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/CowsOnADairyFarm-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/CowsOnADairyFarm-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/CowsOnADairyFarm.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186710" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;More than 1,000 US dairy herds have tested positive in the past two years. (TinaFields/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And although no human cases have been reported in Europe, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Zoonotic_influenza_pre_pandemic_scenarios_SARMS%20FINAL%20VERSION2.pdf"&gt;warns&lt;/a&gt; that the widespread animal circulation raises the risk of spillover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My research focuses on how warnings collapse before catastrophe, from geopolitical shocks to intelligence failures and industrial accidents. The pattern is often the same. Frontline observers spot something early, but the signal fades as it moves upward, diluted by bureaucracy, competing interpretations, or institutional forgetfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent Hong Kong fire is yet another tragic example: residents at Wang Fuk Court &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-hong-kong-fire/"&gt;had raised multiple alarms&lt;/a&gt; about the styrofoam boards that ignited with a lighter, the uncertified netting and the pattern of ignored safety notices long before the blaze, yet those concerns never gained traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The failures I study share recurring blind spots: weak signals drowned out by noise, bureaucratic habits that slow or soften uncomfortable messages, and the political instinct to downplay problems that threaten established narratives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you see warning as a chain running from detection to decision, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/isr/article/27/1/viaf009/8109154"&gt;collapse is often partial&lt;/a&gt;. Some links hold. Others jam at the moment they are most needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bird flu now sits inside that kind of chain. The technical ability to detect change is there: veterinarians, virologists and surveillance systems are picking up signals, sequencing viruses and logging outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the infrastructure meant to catch the virus in its early stages is &lt;a href="http://npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5600125/bird-flu-risk-outbreak-trump-administration"&gt;fraying&lt;/a&gt;. The agencies that once charted the terrain of emerging  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="186706" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; threats have been hollowed out – budgets trimmed, staff evaporated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Surveillance falters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of 31 European nations warned that COVID exposed a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/34/2/402/7603330"&gt;"critical gap in preparedness"&lt;/a&gt; and urged standardised indicators and open data as the foundation for any future response. The EU's freshly launched &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/scenarios-pre-pandemic-zoonotic-influenza-preparedness-and-response"&gt;pre-pandemic plan&lt;/a&gt; is a good step, but it cannot mask the gaps in day-to-day monitoring and response that still leave countries exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the Atlantic, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/01/nx-s1-5619764/months-of-tumult-and-waves-of-staff-cuts-take-a-toll-on-the-cdc"&gt;cuts&lt;/a&gt; have left the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scrambling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American scientists warn that federal reporting has slowed: the United States Department of Agriculture &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/health/h5n1-usda-gisaid-genetic-sequences"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; too little genetic data on the outbreak in cattle and other affected animals, released it late, and in formats researchers could not use. It left scientists unable to track how the virus was evolving or spreading across herds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.midlandfarmer.co.uk/2025/12/04/uk-poorly-prepared-for-animal-disease-outbreaks/"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt;, domestic surveillance capacity has equally faced strain, with reduced access to European disease intelligence and chronic vet shortages weakening early detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the signal dims within institutions, it dims for the public as well. And a weak warning rarely travels far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2025.308080"&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; shows this clearly: most Americans don't even register bird flu as a credible threat. What doesn't help is that symptoms in humans can be so mild that they slide past notice. A &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2024/05/bird-avian-flu-h5n1-cows-pandemic-threat.html"&gt;case&lt;/a&gt; in a dairy worker earlier this year looked like nothing more than conjunctivitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this means a new pandemic is imminent. Health authorities still say the chance of an efficient human-to-human outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/bird-flu-poses-risk-pandemic-worse-than-covid-frances-institut-pasteur-says-2025-11-27/"&gt;is low&lt;/a&gt;. These viruses rarely make that leap. And we're not helpless. We're &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2024/05/bird-avian-flu-h5n1-cows-pandemic-threat.html"&gt;better prepared&lt;/a&gt; than we were before COVID: We have vaccine candidates, clearer protocols and agencies that learned painful lessons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spikes-of-bird-flu-in-cats-could-be-a-warning-of-a-future-pandemic"&gt;Spikes of Bird Flu in Cats Could Be a Warning of a Future Pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But low isn't none. And if it were to occur, the consequences could be catastrophic. Most people have some immunity to the seasonal flu strains. We probably have &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/bird-flu-poses-risk-pandemic-worse-than-covid-frances-institut-pasteur-says-2025-11-27/"&gt;none&lt;/a&gt; to H5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And influenza doesn't restrict itself to the frail in the way COVID often did; past flu epidemics killed healthy adults in large numbers. Adding to the concern, health expertise itself &lt;a href="https://www.apha.org/topics-and-issues/public-health-under-threat"&gt;has come under attack&lt;/a&gt;, weakening the very authority that should turn signals into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we avert our eyes from the bird flu threat because our systems have grown inattentive, underfunded and unprepared, we risk repeating that same pattern. And the next alarm will arrive too late for anyone to claim they didn't see it coming.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271765/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

																										&lt;p&gt;Questions about the nature of &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/category/consciousness/"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt; remain among the most perplexing areas of modern &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/category/science/"&gt;scientific research&lt;/a&gt;, with implications for neuroscience and &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/lost-in-thought-how-meditation-can-sometimes-unsettle-the-mind/"&gt;the human mind&lt;/a&gt;, as well as our broader &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/darpas-inspire-program-seeks-to-revolutionize-our-understanding-of-how-the-brain-constructs-reality/"&gt;concept of reality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, many new thresholds in this complex area of study were crossed, with empirical inquiry into our questions about the nature of consciousness occurring within fields such as &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/category/neuroscience/"&gt;neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/category/psychology/"&gt;psychology&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/category/health/"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Many advancements in this area over the last year have also challenged long-held assumptions about where and how consciousness originates, how widespread it may be, and how profoundly &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/study-finds-mindfulness-training-may-induce-altered-states-of-consciousness/"&gt;altered states&lt;/a&gt; can reshape human perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at just a few of the major stories involving consciousness, the mind, awareness, and the science behind it all that &lt;em&gt;The Debrief &lt;/em&gt;has covered in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did ‘Universal Consciousness’ Exist Before the Big Bang? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the year’s most provocative work about consciousness, one controversial peer-reviewed paper published in &lt;em&gt;AIP Advances &lt;/em&gt;proposed that “&lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/new-study-claims-universal-consciousness-existed-before-the-big-bang-and-still-shapes-our-reality/"&gt;universal consciousness&lt;/a&gt;” may have existed before the Big Bang, functioning not as a byproduct of matter but as a foundational feature of reality itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_27271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-27271" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-27271 lazyload" data-src="https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness.jpg" alt="Consciousness" data-srcset="https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness.jpg 2324w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness-300x182.jpg 300w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness-1024x621.jpg 1024w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness-768x466.jpg 768w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness-1536x932.jpg 1536w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness-2048x1243.jpg 2048w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness-770x467.jpg 770w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness-1400x849.jpg 1400w" data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" src=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-27271" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Image Credit: Pixabay)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such claims are nothing new and remain hotly debated by researchers, although they reflect a growing willingness among scientists to explore questions about consciousness, whether it is purely emergent or could play a deeper role in shaping the universe. The result has been a reignition of discussions long relegated to philosophy, now increasingly framed through modern cosmology and theoretical physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consciousness May Be Far More Widespread Than Previously Believed &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closer to Earth, neuroscientists and cognitive researchers have increasingly argued that consciousness may be far older and more widespread than traditionally believed. Studies examining simple organisms, brain networks, and evolutionary pathways this year, undertaken by researchers at Ruhr University Bochum, suggested that rudimentary forms of awareness &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/scientists-say-consciousness-is-far-older-and-more-widespread-than-we-ever-realized/"&gt;could predate complex nervous systems&lt;/a&gt; throughout the animal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than being the apex of the human evolutionary process, the researchers argue in a pair of papers that appeared in &lt;em&gt;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B,&lt;/em&gt; consciousness “rather represents a more basic cognitive process, possibly shared with other animal phyla.” This reframing has major implications not only for how scientists define consciousness but also for how humans understand their relationship to other life forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychedelic Therapy and Related Discoveries  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most tangible advances came from renewed interest in altered states of consciousness, particularly through psychedelic research. Multiple studies in 2025 demonstrated that psychedelic compounds &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/psychedelics-can-quickly-reorganize-our-brain-functions-offering-promise-for-lasting-therapeutic-approaches/"&gt;can rapidly reorganize brain networks&lt;/a&gt;, temporarily dissolving rigid patterns of thought associated with depression, trauma, and addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_39629" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39629" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-39629 lazyload" data-src="https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/magic-mushrooms.jpg" alt="psilocybin" data-srcset="https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/magic-mushrooms.jpg 800w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/magic-mushrooms-300x199.jpg 300w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/magic-mushrooms-768x509.jpg 768w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/magic-mushrooms-360x240.jpg 360w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/magic-mushrooms-770x510.jpg 770w" data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" src=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-39629" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Image Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, scientists explored non-drug pathways to similar states, such as research into &lt;a href=""&gt;ancient breathwork techniques combined with modern neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; that suggests altered states resembling psychedelic experiences could be induced through controlled breathing alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, long-term studies also continued to examine the social and spiritual dimensions of psychedelic experiences. Decades of research now suggest that such states often produce a heightened sense of connection—to other people, to nature, and to perceived transcendent realities. In 2025, &lt;a href=""&gt;experiments involving participants from diverse religious backgrounds&lt;/a&gt; highlighted how profoundly personal belief systems shape the interpretation of these experiences, even when the underlying neurochemical mechanisms are shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pitting Consciousness Theories Against Each Other &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, researchers &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/i-think-therefore-i-am-study-pitting-top-theories-of-consciousness-against-each-other-reveals-its-findings/"&gt;made rare progress on a long-standing scientific impasse: competing theories of consciousness&lt;/a&gt;. Chris Plain, reporting for &lt;em&gt;The Debrief&lt;/em&gt; in May on a 2025 Allen Institute study, described Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT), a pair of differing approaches to consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting research revealed functional connections between neurons within the visual areas of the brain and the brain’s frontal areas, which the researchers behind the study say helps them “understand how our perceptions tie to our thoughts” while also reducing the typical emphasis on “the importance of the prefrontal cortex in consciousness, suggesting that while it’s important for reasoning and planning, consciousness itself may be linked with sensory processing and perception.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University of Virginia Researchers Study Support Gaps for NDE Experiencers &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, 2025 saw increased attention to near-death experiences (NDEs) as a legitimate area of study. Researchers at the University of Virginia &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/university-of-virginia-researchers-identify-support-gaps-for-people-recovering-from-near-death-experiences/"&gt;identified significant gaps in psychological and medical support for people who report NDEs&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom struggle to integrate these experiences into their lives. While interpretations of NDEs vary widely, the research emphasized a growing consensus: regardless of cause, such experiences can be deeply transformative—and ignoring their impact may carry real mental health consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these stories reveal a year in which consciousness research moved decisively out of the shadows. Whether probing the origins of awareness in the early universe, mapping its neural signatures, or exploring its therapeutic potential, scientists in 2025 treated consciousness not as an unspeakable mystery—but as a frontier worth confronting directly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="156" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna93js001n3b78set17ghu@published"&gt;I have always been curious about group sex. I’ve dabbled in the world of Feeld lately, and have received some interest from hot men for potential threesomes/more and have been tempted to try it but something keeps holding me back. I’m so afraid of feeling like the odd one out or the less enticing person in the party. It’s an insecurity I would say I have in many areas of life beyond sex—I often feel like the one who gets left out in the friend group or the social gathering and I’m so afraid of feeling rejected in that way in a sexual context. Is there a way to protect against that? Am I completely off base to even worry that someone would inevitably get left out, and that someone would be me? I just don’t want to walk away from something that was supposed to be really hot, feeling like I didn’t get picked again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="153" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna93us001q3b786d0sx1ub@published"&gt;The fear of being left out is so common it must be up there with fears of heights and snakes. This can be especially pronounced in vulnerable situations like sex, when rejection feels that much more personal as a result of what has been revealed (your body, your desires, etc.). However, when it comes to pursuing sex, rejection is always a possibility, and that’s how it has to be. People must have the ability to revoke consent at any moment for whatever reason, and the hurt feelings of those who are denied is merely collateral. It can suck, but you know what makes it suck less? Being rejected! You get used to it. You see that it’s not really a big deal, that it’s often not personal, and that you’ll live to see another dick. It can actually be character-building and I think it would be a good thing for you to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna93yi001r3b78cm748l37@published"&gt;If you can’t bear the thought of being rejected, I don’t think you should be on Feeld or any app for that matter—it’s just a matter of time before you find yourself enormously disappointed. Working through this fear of rejection via means other than exposure could also benefit you. For example, you may want to talk to a therapist about your strong feelings here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="205" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna942b001s3b78acegjfrt@published"&gt;However, I do think that your fear in the context you wrote about is somewhat overblown. You are afraid of being left out of group sex that you will have coordinated. While it is true that interacting on apps and in person are two very different modes of communication, you can assume that people are going to be showing up because you have attracted them via what you look like, what you’re offering, and your overall vibe. When people leave their house to have sex (or open their home to host it), they want to have a good time. No one is joining in this group with the objective of leaving you out—that would contradict the point of getting together in the first place. You can help safeguard against being left out, though, by enlisting only straight guys to participate. I don’t think it would be wrong of you to say that you want to be the focus and so all action should involve you. I know gay bottoms that take this approach to group sex/gangbangs and it works out for them. This is one situation where it’s really OK to express your selfishness. I think a lot of guys will just find that hot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna949i001u3b78ssh6imbi@published"&gt;I am a 48-year-old man, and for the last year I thought I was suffering from ED, but it turns out that I just can’t get it up for my wife anymore.  When it comes to porn, I’m back in business. What can I do to rekindle the flame with her?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna94jl001x3b78p7z2suxf@published"&gt;Your assessment sounds right—usually when erectile dysfunction is situational (that is, you can get hard in some situations but not others), it’s regarded as being a psychologically rooted issue (as opposed to a physiological one as a result of, say, diabetes). That said, you are 48 and it’s likely that your testosterone levels aren’t what they used to be. If you aren’t regularly seeing a doctor/getting bloodwork, now’s the time.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="193" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna94nm001y3b78c39txzum@published"&gt;Rekindling could look like a lot of things. If you are having wood issues with your wife, she must be noticing and so a conversation may be useful. It’s common in long-term relationships for desire to wane—Esther Perel’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mating-Captivity-Unlocking-Erotic-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B000UODXP0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2KFLDW9XS3D4&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.9TBgqJH8OXaXJ6KF-p0h2kiUlcEoJVKlMs9LiYHOqbmj3Ltj7tID5mjXlzIy3vFrG-ffA-RkeZjl5zQROs7-3kM8mUhqQUWNxRLL3FauXHkiHYn8o8qVtOT_87IekJCsF76G9rzN0dgy_WDoRNyLXuy62WJsygbNVXDhP6yrk2mODHIW0D6GwNKpTZH-ZlPyxA09WKWnURyMj5NUW4QmHLe1hhXeCS78p77v1q5h6S0.CEYYxaVRazv_Twik-AToMJu7pLXiTSTRs2ZBbnKTNlI&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=mating+in+captivity+esther+perel&amp;amp;qid=1766454898&amp;amp;sprefix=mating+in+ca,aps,137&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mating in Captivity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (my go-to recommended read for these types of situations) explores how closeness is often at odds with eroticism. It wouldn’t be surprising at all if your wife were having similar issues. If you can have an honest (but considerate!) conversation about the underwhelming state of your sex life, you can begin a collaboration to get things back on track. This might mean trying things (like kink, toys, and roleplay) that you’ve been curious about but have been too timid to ask for. It might mean exploring consensual non-monogamy. It might mean putting into practice some of the distancing techniques that Perel writes about (such as moving your sex outside of your home to, say, a hotel with some kind of regularity). It might mean something as simple as enjoying porn together instead of watching it alone. It might mean ongoing conversations and/or enlisting the help of a couples counselor or sex therapist/coach.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, they might as well have cut off another organ. My erections are much less frequent and not the same as they used to be. I don’t think I can get hard enough for penetration (haven’t tried). Pills do nothing. Yet I still think about sex a lot, so the drive is there. Is this normal?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="186" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna957f00243b78uqk3s12y@published"&gt;Sexual dysfunction is common in people who have undergone limb amputation. In a 2015 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26030200/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of people with a limb amputation in the Netherlands, the intro/review of previous literature points out that post amputation, people “may be confronted with a variety of sexual problems, such as problems with arousal and/or orgasm, due to both the physical and/or psychological consequences of a limb amputation.  Furthermore, depression, (sexual) performance anxiety and an altered body image may influence the amputee’s sexual adjustment. Moreover, pain related to the amputation and medication use (to treat this pain) may also affect both sexual interest and activity.” There is a lot stacked against you, and one of the findings of this study’s survey was that there was very little discussion of sexuality during the rehabilitation process. Again, this was a study of Dutch subjects, but it’s hard to believe that elsewhere is doing much better to support these patients. In this study, 56 percent of participants reported at least one sexual problem and 20 percent reported sexual dysfunction(s). The problems included sexual desire (31 percent), sexual arousal (25 percent), and orgasm (21 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna95cg00253b780lu1x163@published"&gt;A more recent &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28359182/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from 2018 of only people with lower limb amputations found that only half were sexually active, and of that group, about 60 percent were sexually dysfunctional. The study’s authors highlighted the need for psychological and psychosexual assessment and intervention after amputation. “Depression, anxiety and body image issues were significantly associated with sexual dysfunction in the current sample of individuals with lower limb amputation,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="143" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna95fr00263b78eeuuqsbk@published"&gt;So yes, it’s hardly surprising that your erections aren’t what they used to be. Diabetes, also, can have detrimental effects on erection quality. You have tried pills, but you may need to look into other options like injectable ED meds (like Trimix) or even an implant. Have you been to therapy or sex coaching regarding your amputation and/or sexual dysfunction? That might also be helpful. You should search for a provider who specifically deals with amputation that is near you or otherwise reachable. You may also want to think about expanding your definition of sex to incorporate things that don’t require an erection—toys, roleplay, forms of BDSM and kink, dressing up, even talking dirty. Don’t give up on your search for a reliable erection, but this is an opportunity to think beyond that and to enter a realm that many take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s believed that the measure will also protect vulnerable patients from infection by measles, which is still surging in the Upstate, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By taking this proactive step, we can help ensure our hospitals remain safe places for our patients to receive high-quality care,” Jacie Volkman, executive director of Prisma’s Department of Infection Prevention, said in the release. “Exceptions may be allowed for circumstances such as the imminent death of a loved one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More suggestions to prevent and protect against the flu, and other respiratory viruses, include frequent handwashing, and staying home or away from others while sick, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://dph.sc.gov/"&gt;South Carolina Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any visitors who feel sick should not visit hospitals. Additionally, it’s recommended that all visitors wear masks to help avoid the spread of respiratory illnesses, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;Flu season&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seasonal flu activity is increasing in most areas of the country, including South Carolina and Tennessee, where Prisma has hospital locations, according to the release. Nationwide, the &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; estimates that there have been at least 4.6 million illnesses, 49,000 hospitalizations and 1,900 deaths from flu so far this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current flu season started Sept. 28, according to the South Carolina Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/flu"&gt;Symptoms can include&lt;/a&gt; a sudden onset of fever, cough, headache or muscle aches, tiredness, sore throat and nasal congestion or stuffiness, the S.C. Department of Public Health said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://dph.sc.gov/sites/scdph/files/2025-12/2025-Flu-Watch-MMWR-WK-51.pdf"&gt;seven flu-related deaths&lt;/a&gt; this season in South Carolina, according to the state Department of Public Health. The Palmetto State has reported more than 6,100 cases of the flu, and has exceeded 700 hospitalizations, S.C. Department of Public Health data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="11" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;Prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the CDC and S.C. Department of Public Health recommend that everyone 6 months of age and older get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination to prevent flu is particularly important for people who are at increased risk of complications from flu, including young children, adults aged 50 years and older, pregnant women and people with certain chronic medical conditions, Prisma officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu vaccines offered at Department of Public Health clinics are available by appointment.

About half of that comes from beverages, but much of the rest is sneaked into cereal, salsa, prepared sandwiches, dairy products, bottled sauces and baked goods, including many brands of whole-grain bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ea3274" class="body-graf"&gt;To help control sugar intake, start by checking the nutrition label. Since 2021, food companies have been required to list the quantity of added sugars separately from total sugar content. But the plan backfired, Avena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d3d9ff" class="body-graf"&gt;Companies reduced common sweeteners like refined beet sugar and high-fructose corn syrup but added alternatives, such as monk fruit and the sugar alcohol erythritol, which aren’t considered “added sugars” under FDA regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-622a60" class="body-graf"&gt;“Now our foods are even more sweet than they were back in 2020,” Avena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b21085" class="body-heading"&gt;What should you do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f2bc00" class="body-graf"&gt;Collin Popp, a dietitian and professor at NYU Langone Health, said the current FDA recommendation allows for some flexibility. People should get no more than 10% of their calories from added sugar, which amounts to about 50 grams per day if eating 2,000 calories, or a bit more than what’s in a typical can of soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9e3502" class="body-graf"&gt;But that might be too flexible, Popp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2c5e2a" class="body-graf"&gt;“I would actually like to see that be less than 5%, and closer to zero for some, if they have diabetes or prediabetes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-23db2f" class="body-graf"&gt;The key is to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/food-safety"&gt;be mindful of what you’re eating&lt;/a&gt;, even if the product &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/28e626562c88439b96056e843215aa8d"&gt;seems healthy&lt;/a&gt; or if the package is labeled organic, Popp said. Roasted nuts, plant-based milks and wasabi peas, for example, can include a surprising amount of added sugars. So can English muffins and Greek yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b317d3" class="body-graf"&gt;One Chobani black cherry yogurt, for example, has zero grams of fat but 9 grams of added sugar, or more than 2 teaspoons. Silk brand almond milk has 7 grams per cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b28053" class="body-graf"&gt;Popp recommends taking control of how much sugar goes into your food. That could mean buying plain yogurt and adding honey or berries, or asking the barista if you can put your own oat milk into your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-311372" class="body-heading"&gt;Taking from one column to add to another&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e05cdd" class="body-graf"&gt;Although they lower the calorie content of foods, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coke-cane-sugar-corn-syrup-better-d7a70ebd4aef1564e409dd087f6a69c3"&gt;artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt; like stevia and sugar alcohols may not be better because they can encourage people to overeat, Avena said. She said research shows that sweet flavors are what activate the reward center of the brain, not the sugar itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57ead7" class="body-graf"&gt;That’s not to write off sugar alternatives, including allulose for people with Type 1 diabetes since it doesn’t affect blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c63c93" class="body-graf"&gt;But for the general public, minimizing dependence on the overall sweetness of food is key to improving health, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-093690" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Don’t let the food companies decide how much sugar you’re eating,” Avena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 16:40:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQRXdZdFBxYlpCdHc5bExyaDNTVm1PYmx1TU1CczlTck1MVkNEeHVmVXBWdjdwTjdabWV2TDByYVE3Wm5YM2dWTENKYVFSVHZqNVc4cG5uMzZtUWNfODVfcVZTWE1GS05SSk9aWV9UUTdUQTh4blFXVFN4QzNZZ2RWMVBNREXSAVZBVV95cUxNbkZoN2p1blhKY3pGdFdPcndzNU1RbXFzbDV1cGtFS2lGNGxLakpZTTJQeVZZUEhPTmwtMzZTcmRNQ18zMGZZdnpVY3d6UGVyMUhMdmEzQQ</guid></item><item><title>您认为“适度”饮酒无害吗？一项62项研究综述提出了癌症问题-研究结果</title><link>https://studyfinds.org/moderate-drinking-review-raises-cancer-concerns/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AdobeStock_284853124-1200x800.jpeg" alt="Portrait of one caucasian man watching tv"&gt;&lt;p class="post-featured-image-caption"&gt;Even an occasional drink could be putting you at risk.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breast cancer dominates:&lt;/strong&gt; Nearly 40% of the 62 studies reviewed found links between alcohol and breast cancer, making it the most common alcohol-related cancer&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No beverage is safer:&lt;/strong&gt; Results varied, but beer, wine, and spirits all showed cancer connections in multiple studies; the type of drink doesn’t eliminate risk&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderate drinking matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Even a few drinks per week showed elevated cancer risk across studies; heavier and more frequent drinking increased risk further&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite alcohol being classified as a Group 1 carcinogen, warning labels and public health messaging rarely mention cancer risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new analysis of 62 studies delivers an unsettling message for Americans who drink: alcohol consumption is consistently tied to breast, colorectal, and liver cancer. Data from tens of millions of American adults showed a link to breast cancer in nearly 40 percent of all studies reviewed. This makes it the single most common cancer associated with drinking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Cancer Epidemiology&lt;/em&gt;, the review found results by beverage type were mixed. Some studies found links across beer, wine, and spirits, while others found wine or beer stood out more than liquor. In a few cases, there was no clear difference &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/alcohol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;between beverage types&lt;/a&gt;. Colorectal cancer was the second most frequently identified cancer in 13 studies, while liver cancer appeared in 10.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heavy-drinkers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Heavy drinkers&lt;/a&gt; aren’t the only ones at risk. People who &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/drinking-kill-brain-cells-alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;drink “moderate” amounts&lt;/a&gt; (a few drinks per week) also showed elevated cancer risk across all three cancer types. Risk tended to rise as drinking increased. While findings at very low levels were sometimes mixed across studies, the overall pattern leans toward “less is better.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-researchers-found-the-alcohol-and-cancer-connection"&gt;How Researchers Found the Alcohol and Cancer Connection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers searched major medical databases for any U.S.-based research examining connections between alcohol consumption and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/hereditary-cancer-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; in adults 18 and older, published between January 2015 and June 2025. After reviewing thousands of potential studies and removing duplicates, they identified 62 studies that met their criteria. Sample sizes ranged from 80 participants to nearly 100 million, giving researchers access to data on tens of millions of American adults.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The review included different types of studies. Some followed people over time, while others compared groups with and without cancer. The review also covered many other cancer types, including &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/gum-disease-head-and-neck-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;head and neck&lt;/a&gt;, esophageal, gastric, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/melanoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt;, though results weren’t always the same across every cancer type. Interestingly, some studies found alcohol was associated with reduced risk of glioma (a type of brain tumor) and multiple myeloma.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pattern across most studies was clear: more drinking was linked with more risk. Both quantity (how much) and frequency (how often) mattered. There’s no universally agreed-upon safe amount where alcohol becomes harmless.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-faces-the-greatest-alcohol-and-cancer-risk"&gt;Who Faces the Greatest Alcohol and Cancer Risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Race and ethnicity emerged as the most frequently mentioned individual risk factor, appearing in 46 of the 62 papers reviewed. Age came in second, mentioned in 42 studies. Certain population groups face disproportionate risk due to factors like healthcare access, socioeconomic status, and genetic variations in how the body processes alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/parenting-style-economic-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;higher socioeconomic status&lt;/a&gt; tend to drink more alcohol overall, but those with lower socioeconomic status experience worse outcomes when they do drink, facing barriers like reduced access to quality healthcare. Racial and ethnic minorities, people experiencing homelessness, and those with mental health conditions all face greater alcohol-related health consequences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption often comes bundled with other health problems that could further increase cancer risk. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; showed up in eight studies, alcoholic liver disease in five studies, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; in four. These interconnected health issues create a web of risk factors that amplify each other over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-people-don-t-know-about-the-alcohol-cancer-connection"&gt;People Don’t Know About The Alcohol-Cancer Connection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The strong link between alcohol and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; appeared in nearly 40 percent of the studies. In many cases, the connection held regardless of beverage type, though some research found wine specifically increased risk for certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite being classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, alcohol remains one of the most commonly used substances in the United States. Many Americans don’t know about alcohol’s cancer risk or underestimate how their drinking habits might affect long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current public health policies around alcohol, such as taxes on alcoholic beverages and limits on liquor store density, rarely mention cancer risk in their messaging. People make decisions about alcohol consumption without complete information about the health consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-there-s-no-safe-level-of-alcohol-consumption"&gt;There’s No ‘Safe’ Level Of Alcohol Consumption&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is what researchers call a “leading modifiable risk factor” for cancer. Unlike genetics or age, it’s something people can change. But change requires accurate information about what drinking habits mean for health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research delivers a straightforward message: less is better when it comes to cancer risk. An &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/any-amount-alcohol-brain-damage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;occasional drink &lt;/a&gt;might not dramatically spike an individual’s risk, but in many studies, regular drinking (even moderate amounts) was linked with higher cancer rates over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Questions naturally follow. Should alcohol packaging carry &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/surgeon-general-vivek-murthy-alcohol-advisory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer warnings&lt;/a&gt;? Should doctors routinely screen patients for alcohol use and discuss cancer risk? This research makes these questions harder to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: Americans deserve honest information about &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/drinking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;how their drinking habits&lt;/a&gt; affect their health. With that knowledge, they can decide for themselves whether the next drink is worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-study-limitations"&gt;Study Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This systematic review has several important limitations that readers should keep in mind when interpreting the findings. First, the researchers focused exclusively on descriptive, observational, qualitative, and experimental studies, which means they excluded case reports, letters to the editor, published conference abstracts, and grey literature. Some relevant evidence may not have been captured as a result, though the researchers worked with an experienced librarian to develop a comprehensive search strategy to minimize omissions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, the 62 studies included in the review varied substantially in their population characteristics, study procedures, and definitions of what constitutes different levels of alcohol consumption. This variation makes it difficult to compare studies directly and limits the uniformity of the data. While researchers used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist to assess study quality and reduce bias, differences in methods across studies remain a consideration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Third, the inclusion and exclusion criteria limited findings to at-risk populations within the United States. While this focus provides valuable insights about American adults specifically, it may limit how well these findings apply to other countries and excludes potentially relevant international research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fourth, more evidence is needed to distinguish between independent risk factors related to alcohol consumption and confounding factors when examining associations with cancer development over time. For example, people who drink alcohol frequently may also have other risk factors like smoking or poor diet that contribute to cancer risk. Teasing apart these interconnected factors requires careful statistical analysis and, in some cases, more targeted research designs.&lt;/p&gt;

He claimed nearly three-quarters of his patients have improved since beginning an exercise regimen.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'The psychoanalytic way of thinking has always been that there were other approaches other than the use of medications,' said Gilberg, who also helps A-list actors delve into the minds of their characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You get some benefit from the medication, but it does have a numbing effect… that's why I'm very reluctant about them.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Arnold Gilberg (pictured) is a leading psychiatrist at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles and trained psychoanalyst who is reluctant to prescribe antidepressants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gilberg's method of treating patients with mild to severe anxiety and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-e67d12d0-d799-11f0-a57f-b5ccfc25dd93"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; was shaped by the teachings of his mentor Franz Alexander, a psychoanalyst who learned the theories and techniques from Sigmund Freud himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alexander, who is widely considered the father of psychosomatic medicine, instilled in Gilberg the importance of treating the whole person within the context of their life, not just a set of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a patient's first 50-minute session at Gilberg's office, the primary focus is delving into current crises they are experiencing rather than exclusively exploring more profound childhood trauma. This might be a divorce, bereavement, problems with a child or job stress, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gilberg is also a big fan of yoga, framing it as an 'opportunity' for patients to actively participate in their own healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm very holistic,' he told the Daily Mail. 'I encourage all my patients to do yoga and meditate, and there are all these modalities of care that we have available to us.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise acts as a powerful, natural antidepressant by increasing the brain's production of endorphins and other mood-regulating neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also reduces the body's stress hormones, such as cortisol and adrenaline, helping to alleviate both depression and anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Harvard researchers reported in 2019 that committing to a manageable bout of exercise, such as 15 minutes of brisk walking, can reduce the risk of depression &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/more-evidence-that-exercise-can-boost-mood"&gt;by 26 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This isn't to say that Gilberg and other psychoanalysts have stopped rooting out trauma.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead they address the most immediate problem, such as a sudden loss, first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We all have traumas in development. That's just the way it goes,' he said, describing a foundational Freudian concept. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And as a psychoanalyst, over time, you do explore those issues. But when a person's going through an acute trauma, that's not the time to start peeling away at the onion.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So essentially, he seeks to put out the fire first and find the cause later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Freud believed the mind was a fortress that guarded painful memories and secrets rooted in traumatic experiences, which the psyche buried deep in your subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Recent data indicates over 47 million American adults currently have or are being treated for depression, while statistics show over 21 million adults and five million adolescents experienced a depressive episode in the past year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Between 2009 and 2018, antidepressant use rose significantly among women, climbing from 13.8 percent to 18.6 percent. For men, however, the rate remained relatively stable, rising only slightly from 7.1 percent to 8.7 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He theorized that when these memories broke through the mind's defenses, they manifested as symptoms like anxiety or dissociation from your body or surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The path to healing, in Freud's view, was slow, deliberate work facing scarring memories head-on. The goal was to gently unearth this unconscious material and integrate it into a conscious narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Today's psychoanalytic thinking is different,' said Gilberg, who is also the author of &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Aging-Prescription-Emotional-Well-Being/dp/B0FKN9WVMS"&gt;The Myth of Aging: A Prescription for Emotional and Physical Well-Being&lt;/a&gt;. 'We're not interested in going back to what happened when they were a child, but we want to stay on top of what's going on now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So we explore how badly he or she feels. We want to talk about what they're doing to make things a bit better.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gilberg has not shunned antidepressants completely, and acknowledges they can be 'worthwhile and good options' for severe, biologically rooted conditions such as major depression or bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he worries that pills have gone from being just one facet of a mental health treatment plan, which typically includes regular therapy, to the default approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Uptake of antidepressants has risen steadily for decades, particularly since the 1987 release of Prozac, the world's first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prescriptions of SSRIs and similar SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) soared in the years that followed. Americans filled 42 million prescriptions in 2010, a figure that rose 108 percent to more than 88 million by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In 2010, Americans filled 42 million SSRI or SNRI prescriptions - this number surged by 108 percent to more than 88 million by 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While I believe in antidepressants for major illnesses like bipolar and schizophrenia, I have been concerned about the use of antidepressants, which are dished out so easily, because of the impact they have on the individual,' Gilberg told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that SSRIs have been used so widely that they have become not just the default treatment approach among many doctors but among patients as well - many of whom have been led to think they cannot solve internal conflicts through non-medical modes like psychotherapy, or that they will provide a quick fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think that for myself, anyway, we have to be very discriminating about how we use the medications that we have available to us, because the medications themselves have side effects,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients taking the medications experience sexual dysfunction, including low libido, delayed orgasm or numbness, which can strain relationships and lower quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other frequent complaints include weight gain, feeling detached or less responsive - known as emotional blunting - and digestive issues like nausea or constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While not everyone is affected, he said these side effects are common enough for around a quarter of patients to stop taking their medication as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;You can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;pre-order Gilberg's new book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;, The Myth of Aging: A Prescription for Emotional and Physical Well-Being, out on January 13, 2026. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These psychiatric conditions affect millions of people worldwide, yet they remain difficult to diagnose because scientists have not fully understood their underlying molecular causes.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings could eventually help doctors reduce mistakes in diagnosing and treating mental health disorders. Today, many psychiatric conditions are identified through clinical judgment alone and treated using a trial-and-error approach to medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;APL Bioengineering&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder Are Hard to Diagnose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are very hard to diagnose because no particular part of the brain goes off. No specific enzymes are going off like in Parkinson's, another neurological disease where doctors can diagnose and treat based on dopamine levels even though it still doesn't have a proper cure," said Annie Kathuria, a Johns Hopkins University biomedical engineer who led the study. "Our hope is that in the future we can not only confirm a patient is schizophrenic or bipolar from brain organoids, but that we can also start testing drugs on the organoids to find out what drug concentrations might help them get to a healthy state."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Scientists Built and Studied Brain Organoids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, Kathuria's team created brain organoids, which are simplified versions of real human organs. They started by turning blood and skin cells from patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and from healthy individuals into stem cells capable of developing into brain-like tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team then used machine learning tools to analyze the electrical activity of cells inside these mini brains. In the human brain, neurons communicate by sending brief electrical signals to one another, and the researchers focused on identifying patterns in that activity linked to healthy and unhealthy brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrical Biomarkers Identify Mental Illness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that specific features of the organoids' electrical behavior acted as biomarkers for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Using these signals alone, they were able to correctly identify which organoids came from affected patients 83% of the time. When the tissue received gentle electrical stimulation designed to bring out more neural activity, accuracy increased to 92%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patterns they uncovered were complex and highly specific. Neurons from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients showed unusual firing spikes and timing changes across multiple electrical measurements, creating a distinct signature for each condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At least molecularly, we can check what goes wrong when we are making these brains in a dish and distinguish between organoids from a healthy person, a schizophrenia patient, or a bipolar patient based on these electrophysiology signatures," Kathuria said. "We track the electrical signals produced by neurons during development, comparing them to organoids from patients without these mental health disorders."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Microchips to Map Brain Activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand how neurons formed networks, the researchers placed the organoids on microchips equipped with multi-electrode arrays arranged like a grid. This setup allowed them to collect data in a way similar to a tiny electroencephalogram, or EEG, the test doctors use to measure brain activity in patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When fully developed, the organoids reached about three millimeters in diameter. They contained multiple types of neural cells normally found in the brain's prefrontal cortex, a region involved in higher-level thinking. The mini brains also produced myelin, a substance that insulates nerve cells and helps electrical signals travel more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward Personalized Psychiatric Treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study included samples from just 12 patients, but Kathuria believes the results point toward meaningful clinical applications. The organoids could eventually serve as a testing platform for psychiatric medications before those drugs are prescribed to patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is now collaborating with neurosurgeons, psychiatrists, and neuroscientists at the John Hopkins School of Medicine. They are collecting additional blood samples from psychiatric patients to study how different drug concentrations affect organoid activity. Even with a limited number of samples, the researchers believe they may be able to suggest medication doses that help restore healthier neural patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's how most doctors give patients these drugs, with a trial-and-error method that may take six or seven months to finds the right drug," Kathuria said. "Clozapine is the most common drug prescribed for schizophrenia, but about 40% of patients are resistant to it. With our organoids, maybe we won't have to do that trial-and-error period. Maybe we can give them the right drug sooner than that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Some are triumphant—like the time I hosted my entire MFA cohort with a DIY &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2019/03/02/crispy-creamy-loaded-baked-potatoes-recipe-fully-loaded_partner/"&gt;baked potato&lt;/a&gt; bar and some donated &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/01/21/no-time-for-celebration-champagne-sales-are-reportedly-on-the-decline-new-report-finds/"&gt;champagne.&lt;/a&gt; Others are sadder: the week a breakup coincided with unexpected medical bills, when I stood at the self-checkout feeding $23 worth of quarters (my last money until payday, and yes, it takes exactly as long as you’re imagining) into the machine so I could buy &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/06/20/alton-brown-good-eats-grilling-pantry-salon-talks/"&gt;chicken thighs&lt;/a&gt;, vegetables and rice. All I wanted then was to sink into a pot of chicken-and-rice stew and weep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is different. This one is about quiet confidence — the sort that only comes from surviving enough $23-in-quarters days to know you’ll be okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It began innocently. I’d swapped handbags for the season — a slouchy straw tote with a teak handle traded for a forest-green suede pouch — and my wallet, apparently, hadn’t gotten the memo. Because of my deep and abiding distrust of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/01/31/a-patriot-economy-media-expands-into-fintech-with-truthfi/"&gt;fintech&lt;/a&gt; (a story for another day), I keep a little emergency cash tucked into my bags. Still, there I was in the supermarket, wallet-less, armed with $12, a dying phone and my transit card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a moment, I panicked. And then I didn’t. I realized I had everything I needed to get home and make a good dinner. What, exactly, was I pressed about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started in the produce aisle, as I often do, scanning the marked-down netted bags — imperfect, but still sturdy and fragrant. I grabbed one with a few &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/12/25/how-to-make-savory-sweet-shallot-jam-with-three-ingredients_partner/"&gt;shallots &lt;/a&gt;and a &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/03/19/youre-cooking-with-one-onion-you-should-be-cooking-with-four/"&gt;head of garlic&lt;/a&gt;, added a carton of cheap white mushrooms, then a ninety-nine-cent box of pasta, a small wedge of Parm from Murray’s “under $5” bin and a carton of six eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back home, after the train ride, I washed and dried the mushrooms and sent them sizzling into a pan with shallots, garlic, salt, pepper and an indecent amount of smoked paprika. They crisped and darkened, developing a savory depth that stood in happily for pork. Tossed with pasta, egg, cheese, and a little of the starchy cooking water, they became a mushroom &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/04/24/my-10-year-carbonara-journey/"&gt;carbonara&lt;/a&gt;—rich, smoky, and deeply satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt decadent. And there was enough for two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking about that meal, especially because this year has been rough. Groceries cost more, time feels thinner and the idea that eating well — both pleasurable and nourishing — should be attainable on a modest budget can feel almost quaint. As we head into a new year, many of us are doing the same math over and over: trying to square taste with nutrition, care with constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this feels familiar —if you’re feeling tired, hungry and underpaid all at once—let me just say: you’re not imagining it. You’re not alone. I’ve teared up in grocery aisles myself, realizing the little treat I’d budgeted for (or some weeks, the extra bit of meat) wasn’t actually in the cards. I’ve experimented extensively with how far a pot of chicken-and-rice stew can stretch with just a little extra broth. I’ve taken two trains to pick up &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/11/30/too-good-to-go-the-second-life-of-leftovers/"&gt;Too Good To Go &lt;/a&gt;leftovers from restaurants I couldn’t normally afford. I could tell you a dozen ways to use Bisquick to fill out a meal — and I’m fairly certain I could discover a dozen more.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing: good food doesn’t have to be expensive. We know this, even if it’s easy to forget. There is something elementally heavenly about the smell of alliums cooking in butter. Spoon it over a comforting bulk grain — pasta, rice, polenta, &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/05/30/everything-you-need-to-know-about-growing-beans_partner/"&gt;beans&lt;/a&gt; — top it with a single egg, and it will set you right almost every time. You can scale up if you like: some grated cheese, a scatter of fresh herbs, maybe crispy pork. But you don’t have to. Sometimes, that restraint is the nicest thing you can do for Future You.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows are a few principles I’ve learned for cooking this way. Not perfectly, but with steadiness, pleasure and budget in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nurture a rolodex of “rent week” recipes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a special kind of comfort in having a short list of meals you know, with almost mathematical certainty, will land. In the culinary world, this is often called “rent week” cooking—a term popularized by Alex Delaney in &lt;a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/misc/rent-week?srsltid=AfmBOoqPezkgb7NaXpjfChEJP2XkPOxgmqobSrar3fhCyi5j0FBSrWUi"&gt;his Bon Appétit column &lt;/a&gt;from 2016 to 2019. Delaney’s recipes had a magic trick: they were cheap, fast, and reliably delicious. Think “&lt;a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/overdraft-protection-polenta?srsltid=AfmBOopUkOqvJx71Rw2GKhFLWlFjvjXQUIT5zyIhaNEL9AjBs3EhtyQR"&gt;overdraft-protection polenta&lt;/a&gt;” or a “&lt;a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/rent-week-chorizo-tostada?srsltid=AfmBOoqzeevK15fXCuzfN6N8o7m9l5xw6HD9YBIIZuPQATTXvrkm-E8y"&gt;cheap chorizo tostada&lt;/a&gt;” — meals that somehow still felt cheffy, like a little wink at your former foodie ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered that column shortly after graduating, when my love of food far outstripped my paycheck in public media. It hit just at the right time. For me, my own rent-week roster looks like the mushroom carbonara I’ve told you about, a smoky chickpea curry, feta-eggs on rice with avocado slices, or a black bean stew that can stretch either with a bit of chorizo or a rotisserie chicken scavenged from the sale bin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point isn’t perfection—it’s predictability, pleasure, and the quiet relief of knowing that, even when the week is long and the budget short, dinner is still a thing you can get right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn the rhythms of your grocery store&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every supermarket has a secret life, if you know how to watch. There’s a cadence to sales, a pattern to coupons, a small ecosystem of rewards programs and “oops” bins where imperfect or surplus food waits quietly for someone to notice. At my Mariano’s, there’s a section labeled “Oops! We baked too much,” which houses overstock bread and &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/10/14/fig-jam-hand-pies-for-the-hesitant-host/"&gt;pastries&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also a section for imperfect produce, as well as a tiny corner of discounted meat, like a tiny treasure trove for those paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about snagging a deal; it’s about knowing where the value is and when. Some stores have unbeatable per-unit prices on pantry staples, while others shine with proteins or prepared items. The Vietnamese grocery down my street, for example, always has the best Jasmine rice and canned coconut milk, though the protein prices are steeper. Knowing this allows me to plan trips that actually make sense: sometimes it’s worth a detour for a specialty ingredient, other times it’s smarter to stick to one store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it like learning the rhythm of your own kitchen, except bigger, louder, and fluorescent-lit: once you understand it, your budget stretches in ways that feel almost effortless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plan a little for Future You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit it: I am a dork about pre-planning. I keep a household binder that I update quarterly, a habit that became strangely essential while recovering from lingering post-COVID brain fog. One section is devoted entirely to food, subdivided into tiny compartments of order: nutrition goals for the quarter, menus and budgets for holidays or birthdays, recipes I want to try (already printed and annotated with shopping lists), and finally, the pièce de résistance—my quarterly dinner queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dinner queue is a concept I first encountered in Kendra Adachi’s “&lt;a href="https://www.thelazygeniuscollective.com/kitchen"&gt;The Lazy Genius Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s deceptively simple: a curated list of meals you intend to make for dinner. You might be thinking, “Isn’t the whole internet a list? Aren’t all my cookbooks lists?” Yes, but those lists are too big. Overwhelming. And overwhelm is the state in which I make most of my bad financial decisions. Adachi &lt;a href="https://www.thelazygeniuscollective.com/lazy/falldinners"&gt;puts it beautifully&lt;/a&gt;: “A dinner queue can be ten meals you repeat, thirty meals you do for an entire month and repeat, or maybe even more than that if you’re not a fan of repetition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need a binder or a full-blown quarterly system to reap the benefits. Even a little pre-planning—whether for a week, a month, or a cooking “season”—lets you approach dinner with confidence, reduces stress, and keeps your budget in mind without having to reinvent every meal from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But stay flexible (and realistic)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some nights, you come home late on a snowy evening and the last thing you want to do is make whatever dinner you had meticulously planned. That’s when a little self-compassion—and a small arsenal of freezer and pantry favorites—becomes your secret weapon. &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/11/26/let-trader-joes-help-you-plan-a-budget-thanksgiving-dinner-for-30/"&gt;Trader Joe’s &lt;/a&gt;orange chicken. A bag of dumplings. Stouffer’s lasagna. White cheddar shells. Even a frozen pizza that’s not quite artisanal but somehow perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These “easy wins” bridge the gap between exhaustion and sustenance without forcing you to spend $72 on a pair of sad burrito bowls from a takeout app. The trick is building a little wiggle room in your budget for them—so that a fallback meal feels like a relief, not a splurge. Flexibility isn’t about throwing plans out the window; it’s about giving Future You the kindness and tools needed to survive the week with dignity, warmth and, yes, occasional cheese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nerd out on technique&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a surprising joy to be found in coaxing the absolute most from humble ingredients—if you can be bothered to notice. Stewing a piece of meat until it transforms from leather into something tender and succulent. Turning the odds and ends of vegetables—peels, stems, bruised bits—into a fragrant stock that makes even weeknight soup feel luxurious. Toasting spices in oil until they bloom and scent the kitchen with something almost magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not about impressing anyone. It’s about seeing potential in the ordinary, finding pleasure in the small transformations and discovering that even the simplest ingredients can carry a richness you’d almost forgotten was possible. Technique is not a chore. It’s a quiet way to honor your food, your time and Future You.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Give everything a second life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite lessons came from a restaurant manager at a small, hip café: “Give everything a second life.” It sounds obvious, but it’s amazing how often we toss what could be treasure. Take carrots, for instance. Carrot peels became stock. Extra shredded carrots were saved for &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/10/28/a-better-pumpkin-bread-made-with-coffee-citrus-and-chocolate/"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt; or pickled for a salad. Carrot tops were transformed into pesto. Nothing went to waste and everything found a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carleigh Bodrug’s “&lt;a href="https://plantyou.com/category/scrappy-cooking/"&gt;Scrappy Cooking&lt;/a&gt;” and Tamar Adler’s “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everlasting-Meal-Cookbook-Leftovers-Z/dp/1476799660"&gt;The Everlasting Meal Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;” are brilliant companions for this mindset, offering clever, unexpected ways to elevate what might otherwise be scraps. It turns the ordinary into something that feels thoughtful, deliberate, and yes—a little magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Build a solid pantry, bit by bit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to grow up in a household where basics were taken for granted, which made adulthood a bit of a shock: decent toilet paper, a shower curtain that doesn’t disintegrate in the wash, a rug that actually fits under the bed — all these small necessities suddenly had a cost. But the real challenge, and the real joy, was building a pantry beyond salt, pepper and oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the honest truth: the difference between a budget meal that tastes like one and one that doesn’t is often just time (a soup simmered for 90 minutes instead of 15 will taste richer) and decent spices. It’s worth investing slowly. International markets often have the best deals on spices, but your local supermarket can surprise you too — especially during holiday or New Year sales. For nonperishables, picking up an extra can or two of beans, a jar of tomato paste, or a staple oil can quietly change the trajectory of your weeknight cooking. Even dedicating a small portion of your grocery budget — $20 a month, say — to new spices, vinegars or oils can steadily bolster your collection, making your pantry a toolkit for meals that feel abundant, not scrappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Master a few “fridge clean-out” meals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a different beast from your rent-week recipes, but just as essential. The idea is simple: have a few go-to templates for using up the bibs and bobs lurking in your kitchen, depending on your mood and what’s in the crisper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/06/05/the-frittata-that-bought-us-a_partner/"&gt;frittatas&lt;/a&gt; or egg bakes, perfect for dispatching vegetable scraps, wilting herbs, bits of cheese or that lone slice of bacon that’s been begging for a job. Or a &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/01/24/cozy-up-to-this-new-chicken-and-wild-mushroom-stew-with-schmaltzy-croutons/"&gt;sturdy stew&lt;/a&gt;: a can of tomatoes, an errant link of sausage, a handful of chickpeas, all brightened with greens that need a home. Stir-fries, &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/11/13/better-oatmeal-made-at-home/"&gt;savory oats&lt;/a&gt;, rice bowls, flatbreads, &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/08/19/i-rescued-a-panini-press-it-saved-dinner/"&gt;paninis,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/11/18/a-magical-maple-pumpkin-pasta-sauce/"&gt;pasta&lt;/a&gt;—whatever suits your style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joy of these meals is in their freedom: they’re forgiving, flexible, and somehow deeply satisfying. Fridge clean-out cooking turns potential waste into dinner that feels intentional, resourceful and, above all, comforting.&lt;/p&gt;

The analysis involved 40,725 adults in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1999 and 2018, in which participants were asked about all the food and drink they consumed on at least one day, including whether they drank coffee, how much, and when. It also included a sub-group of 1,463 people who were asked to complete a detailed food and drink diary for a full week. This information was then linked with records of deaths and causes of death over a period of nine to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that compared with people who did not drink coffee, morning coffee drinkers were 16% less likely to die of any cause and 31% less likely to die of cardiovascular disease. However, there was no reduction in risk for all-day coffee drinkers compared to non-coffee drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morning coffee drinkers were found to have a lower risk of all-cause mortality and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a69277325/top-heart-disease-risk-factors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, whether they had two to three cups per day or more than three cups. In comparison, those who had one cup or less in the morning benefitted from a smaller decrease in risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings indicate that it’s not just whether you drink coffee or how much you drink, but the time of day when you drink coffee that’s important,” senior study author &lt;a href="https://sph.tulane.edu/epid/lu-qi" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lu Qi, M.D., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lu Qi, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, professor at the Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1069398" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:news release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;news release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We don’t typically give advice about timing in our dietary guidance,” Dr. Qi continued, “but perhaps we should be thinking about this in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how does coffee benefit health? In addition to making you feel upbeat and energized, coffee also contains phenolic acid and flavonoids—antioxidants that protect your body from the damage caused by free radicals, said &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/melissa-ann-prest" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Melissa Mroz-Planells, D.C.N., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Melissa Mroz-Planells, D.C.N., R.D.N.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, national media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and member of the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/about/g26577234/medical-review-board/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prevention Medical Review Board;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt; Medical Review Board&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, this study suggests that morning coffee consumption, as opposed to an all-day pattern, may be linked to even lower risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. “This association may be due to coffee’s interaction with circadian rhythms," said &lt;a href="https://baptisthealth.net/doctors/adedapo-adeyinka-iluyomade/2103193" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Adedapo Iluyomade, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adedapo Iluyomade, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, preventative cardiologist with Baptist Health Miami Cardiac &amp;amp; Vascular Institute. "Consuming caffeine later in the day can &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a69197866/melatonin-vs-magnesium-for-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:disrupt sleep patterns;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;disrupt sleep patterns&lt;/a&gt; and melatonin secretion, potentially negating some of its health benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having coffee earlier in the day is usually recommended so as not to disrupt your circadian rhythm, agreed Mroz-Planells, as “poor sleep quality and lack of sleep can affect your health and wellbeing.” A study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38007301/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sleep Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sleep Health&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;even found that poor sleep quality was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality among middle-aged and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights that both the timing and amount of coffee you drink matter when assessing its health benefits, said Dr. Iluyomade. “Regular, moderate coffee intake in the morning appears to confer a greater protective effect against cardiovascular and overall mortality compared to sporadic or late-day consumption, emphasizing the importance of aligning dietary habits with natural circadian rhythms,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee’s health benefits are not limited to cardiovascular protection, Dr. Iluyomade continued. “Moderate intake has also been linked to a reduced risk of several chronic conditions, including type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and neurodegenerative diseases.” However, these associations are based on observational data, so individuals should consider their own tolerance and response to caffeine, he pointed out. Either way, if you like to start your day with a cup or two of coffee, feel free to keep at it—just consider switching to other beverages like water later in the day to get the most health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 15:25:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE8wV2dOT3hYY3FRTjhpUFc5Uk9BRmNGaHFhd2hxYm5VQzBhWjJ6WE5VZHY4dUNNRWNiS0pRMnhEM1VhcjdTd1B5T3A2c29GdUFNX1kwTTdNUEtRcldHR0VDemFxTUxtOF9DaVF6dVg5bGxvazlmV015a1Fn</guid></item><item><title>突破性的血液检测为早期胰腺癌检测带来希望- Cleveland.com</title><link>https://www.cleveland.com/news/2025/12/breakthrough-blood-tests-offer-hope-in-early-pancreatic-cancer-detection.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="53EGGZDZFFBHRCXTM5CDMVV464"&gt;CLEVELAND, Ohio — Pancreatic cancer stands apart from many common cancers for a troubling reason: There is no standard screening test to catch the disease early, when treatment is most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F3KSKTNEIRBSNLDRSL43X7EPOA"&gt;That has led to a detection gap with deadly consequences for Ohioans, as the disease remains invisible in its early stages, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HD546TOHT5CGXCITQBXFHJONDY"&gt;But researchers believe there is hope on the horizon.

Only 11 percent of Ohioans with pancreatic cancer survive five years after diagnosis, consistent with the national average, according to ODH. Approximately 60 to 70 percent of cases are diagnosed at late stages when surgery is no longer possible, Dr. Winter added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EWQF24P5LBB4FPNYA2CWAIP5Q4"&gt;“We can correlate that to both the lack of an early detection test as well as poor treatment options,” Winter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KUXJZQ2ALZA2NBDJ4RL35IQRXU"&gt;The pancreas is a 6-inch-long gland located between the stomach and spine. It produces juices that break down food and hormones like insulin and glucagon that control blood sugar levels. When cancer is detected early and has not spread, surgery can cure the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UBYTFHIUWFFIFKTKNTSGFU5FZU"&gt;But most cases are found at advanced stages, when doctors can only aim to control cancer and improve quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2XUAFQZLA5CYTH7DSSZYDPINLA"&gt;Part of the problem is that symptoms are vague and easily mistaken for other conditions. Patients may experience a deep, dull ache in the abdomen, weight loss or new-onset diabetes. Symptoms can also include jaundice, itchy skin, greasy or clay-colored stools and dark urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RZ372N3FAZHONHL2GRHTCW77L4"&gt;“Pancreas cancer often presents with very non-specific symptoms that typically are caused by other underlying processes other than pancreas cancer,” Winter said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KCOBWG7TT5CQXNFSFHBIKDYVRM"&gt;The disease primarily affects older adults in their 60s and 70s, though it can occur in people as young as 30. Risk factors include smoking, chronic pancreatitis, obesity and family history. Having one close relative with pancreatic cancer triples the relative risk; having two relatives increases it sixfold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YCPIAQKWWVBFFMDRLGWIO7CGAE"&gt;Black individuals have the highest incidence and mortality rates, though experts have not determined why, according to government data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2GTOOT3L7NHMRP6QV5EHY5ZZWI"&gt;In Ohio, Cuyahoga County experienced the highest incidence rates from 2017 to 2021, with 255 cases and 235 deaths on average per year. Franklin County followed with 188 cases and 158 deaths per year. Hamilton and Summit counties also saw high incidence and mortality rates in connection with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FDTSFKAMSBGMTESRUNSUUI6MCI"&gt;The figures show the need for early detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5UHJUH7ODJGBNP6ZR6CCIUJKQA"&gt;“There’s a lot of hope for people who have it detected early enough and are getting surgery for pancreatic cancer,” Winter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UDBO3CHENFAXPNGFNAH7AGGHQM"&gt;Winter is the director of the Winter Lab at Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, which aims to study effective therapies for pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HVXI55ZBAZDCVJARDEJPBXI3JU"&gt;Clinical trials are exploring KRAS inhibitors, which target a gene activated in almost all pancreatic cancers, and vaccines designed to prevent recurrence after surgery. Winter encourages those being treated for the disease to participate in the trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AU7BVBRNYFDQHKHWJNTFXCWSI4"&gt;“Consideration for clinical trials is so important because those trials may help their loved one, but they also help us learn more about how to treat this disease better so that we can have a different solution, a better solution for people in the future than we have today,” Winter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TEMOYSZONZF4RECMNECIUXF2A4"&gt;Those interested in supporting efforts to help with pancreatic cancer research are also encouraged to participate in events like the &lt;a href="https://secure.pancan.org/site/TR/PurpleStride/PurpleStride?fr_id=3078&amp;amp;pg=entry" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;PurpleStride in April to help raise awareness and resources to fight the disease.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Cleveland.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 15:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxPNzQ4dTNyMko3WThOSFhWQWYxc1JhWlhXdUZWYWNZQWg0Ymh3VFZiU2hGbjZKaDZ6Z3F1VVd0Qy1ab2cxSjhaVEJPeFAyQks1VGZnNmhmeGI4bHRBOVNkczIxbHpyc2JWamhGZkFvTDFZUkliYXdjeEw4RDQ2T2NfNDZuMi1WRnp5Znc5OUxISlpnaDlnWWsycVJNY0RUWEJjVjJlajN6WElQV1dtMXBOamI2OVBYUm_SAcsBQVVfeXFMTXFLdW1ReFFMWlVYc2RqRmxsSm1NaU51ZWpzVXRhV2FENWpVd3Q5UkpIOVpPQmc2Z0oyQ2Z2UzF4TnZVOW1qVllub2RhSFVycjZSaWV0c2t1MWxVTlN6STFpbW5ScmZTWHd4RUs4a2VMbGFnZ0FacnJyQkpzN0lSNXp1dnJGTEFQSy1aYW5CZXdDbG96QWt0OFRRVmhVc0VBQXJodW9ZZC1qanNNTTZ6bkJtS2xyT05oWHFDdzhOMzVxLUNLV3JMUGhvUDg</guid></item><item><title>随着流感发病率的上升，以色列卫生官员呼吁对反vaxxers进行制裁-耶路撒冷邮报</title><link>https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/article-881578</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;403 Forbidden&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</description><author>The Jerusalem Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 14:45:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9XWG1nR3dxc25IV2ZhWVEzSWRNYjFXUUlpMjZrYW1JWHFiMUNIQ2dYSUlQQ1dMYkpZSDhTdmFYTTRBNlJzal9KTldDU2RrWV80THlHTENmeEJRSGlEdGZHUDJKWDg1M1E</guid></item></channel></rss>
