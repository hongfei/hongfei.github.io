&lt;p&gt;Planning a sunny getaway? You might want to pack a mosquito net. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health experts &lt;a href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/197/9/E244#msdynmkt_trackingcontext=fed021b2-0f52-49ac-9c7a-72decef20000" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;are warning&lt;/a&gt; about an emerging threat making waves in popular vacation destinations, as cases of the Oropouche virus have been reported in US and Canadian travelers returning from Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba and Peru.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While much about the tropical disease remains unknown, the recent spate of infections has raised questions about whether it could become the next Zika virus. Here’s everything you need to know about this potential travel headache.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mosquitoes are believed to play a role in Oropouche virus transmission.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;wirakorn – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the Oropouche virus?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Oropouche virus is primarily spread through the bites of small flies called midges, as well as certain species of mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s commonly referred to as “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/health/what-is-sloth-fever-oropouche-virus/"&gt;sloth fever&lt;/a&gt;” because the virus was first identified in the slow-moving mammal, which researchers believe played a key role in its spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since its discovery in 1955, there have been an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5938787/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;estimated 500,000 cases of Oropouche virus&lt;/a&gt;, mostly around the Amazon Basin. However, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/data-maps/countries-and-territories-at-risk-for-oropouche.html"&gt;starting in late 2023&lt;/a&gt;, the virus has started popping up in new areas of South America and the Caribbean where it hadn’t been seen before, raising concerns about its expanding reach.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;As of March 11, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/data-maps/current-year-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC has identified&lt;/a&gt; 109 cases of sloth fever in US travelers from seven states, including &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2024/2024-09-12_rare_virus.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one case in New York&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the illnesses have been reported in Florida, with 103 cases so far in 2024 and the first three months of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Symptoms to watch for&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re bitten by a mosquito or midge carrying the Oropouche virus, symptoms can appear anywhere from three to 10 days later, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms include a sudden fever and severe headache, often resembling those of other tropical illnesses like &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/25/dengue-fever-cases-could-reach-near-record-highs-this-year-what-to-know-about-the-tropical-infectious-disease/#!"&gt;dengue&lt;/a&gt;, chikungunya, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2016/01/28/first-person-account-of-being-stricken-with-the-zika-virus/"&gt;Zika&lt;/a&gt; or malaria. Additional symptoms can include chills, muscle aches, joint pain, light sensitivity, dizziness, pain behind the eyes, nausea, vomiting and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Many of the symptoms of sloth fever are similar to those of other tropical diseases, such as the Zika virus. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dragana Gordic – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In most cases, symptoms last less than a week, with most people fully recovering within a month. However, the CDC notes that some individuals may experience a recurrence of symptoms, either a few days or even weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, the Oropouche virus can cause more severe conditions, such as excessive bleeding, brain swelling, or &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/28/health/guillain-barre-patient-running-nyc-marathon-a-decade-after-diagnosis/"&gt;Guillain-Barré syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which can lead to muscle weakness, numbness and paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While fatalities are uncommon, there have been a &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/24-7-2024-qa-oropouche-fever" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;few instances where the virus has proven fatal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Pregnancy risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Oropouche virus doesn’t just pose a threat to adults and children — it can also be transmitted from a pregnant person to their unborn fetus, with potentially devastating consequences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Multiple reports of fetal loss among women with Oropouche virus disease during early and late pregnancy have been reported. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Yakobchuk Olena – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infection during pregnancy has been linked to stillbirths, miscarriages, and other serious risks to the fetus, such as low birth weight, skull collapse, club foot, and microcephaly, a condition where brain development is significantly impaired.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given these risks, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/outbreaks/2024/index.html#:~:text=Oropouche%20virus%20is%20spread%20to,Travel%20Health%20Notice%20for%20Oropouche." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;is advising&lt;/a&gt; pregnant women to reconsider any nonessential travel to areas where &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/oropouche-in-the-americas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Oropouche outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; have recently been reported.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How is sloth fever treated? &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there’s no vaccine to prevent or specific medication to treat Oropouche virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To manage symptoms, the CDC recommends getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers. But don’t reach for aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as they can increase the risk of excessive bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those with more severe symptoms, additional medical care or even hospitalization may be required to ensure proper treatment and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to protect yourself from the Oropouche virus?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To steer clear of the Oropouche virus, your best bet is to minimize exposure to mosquito and midge bites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; wearing loose, long-sleeved shirts and pants when traveling to regions where the virus is circulating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Loose fitting, long-sleeve shirts can help prevent mosquito bites.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;aamulya – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Make sure your accommodations are bug-proof by using window and door screens, or set up a fan outdoors to keep the pests at bay. And of course, don’t forget to bring along insect repellent.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/12/24-1470_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; also found traces of Oropouche virus in the semen of an infected individual for the first time. While no sexual transmission cases have been reported, the CDC suggests that travelers who are worried about contracting or passing the virus through sex to consider using condoms or abstaining from sex during travel and for six weeks after returning home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Could sloth fever start to spread in the US?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Oropouche cases have been reported in American travelers, the risk of widespread transmission in the continental US remains low.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC notes that the US has a different climate and distinct species of mosquitoes and midges compared to those in regions where the virus is common. Additionally, factors like air conditioning make it less likely for the virus to take root. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the agency does warn that infections could still pop up in certain areas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A United Nations food agency warned that the continued spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus is an unprecedented food security risk that requires a coordinated global response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a briefing held on Monday, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations cited the loss of hundreds of millions of poultry around the world and the increasing spillover into mammals as key concerns stemming from the spread of the H5N1 bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The agency noted a major shift in bird flu’s geographic spread in the past four years, with at least 300 newly affected wild bird species since 2021.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Calling the spread unprecedented, FAO Deputy Director-General Godfrey Magwenzi said the disease was “leading to serious impacts on food security and food supply in countries, including loss of valuable nutrition, rural jobs and income, shocks to local economies, and of course increasing costs to consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FAO Deputy Director-General Beth Bechdol called for a coordinated global response, saying, “A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. By working together, we can reduce the impact of avian influenza and protect both animal and human health – locally and globally.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency called on countries to enhance surveillance and reporting of bird flu; improve lab capacity; develop and implement preparedness plans; consider vaccinations in the response; and to promote risk management through biosecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. has 70 cases of bird flu, including 41 cattle herds as well as 24 poultry farms and culling operations. As a zoological disease, there have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission so far and the risk to the public remains low.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Department of Agriculture &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/usda-invests-1-billion-combat-avian-flu-and-reduce-egg-prices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;released a plan&lt;/a&gt; to invest $1 billion to combat the bird flu and reduce egg prices.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In Mississippi, a strain of highly pathogenic bird flu that hasn’t been seen in the U.S. since 2017 was &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5199450-mississippi-reports-first-outbreak-of-highly-pathogenic-bird-flu-strain-in-us-since-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported in a commercial flock&lt;/a&gt;. This occurrence is believed to be unrelated to the current H5N1 spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disease has been credited with causing egg prices to spike, and restaurants have begun implementing surcharges for egg dishes. The Justice Department, however, is also &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-investigating-major-egg-producers-amid-soaring-prices/story?id=119589959" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reportedly investigating&lt;/a&gt; whether major egg producers are colluding to increase prices while using the bird flu situation as a cover.&lt;/p&gt;

It was not immediately clear whether they traveled through the main airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patient was not reported to be a US resident, and no further information was given — including on when they arrived or where they traveled from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesman from the Houston Department of Health told DailyMail.com that no further details on the case were being released in order to protect the patient's privacy. They would not confirm whether the patient went through Houston Airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The infant was hospitalized but has since been discharged. The above picture is a stock image of a child suffering from measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is one of the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14447249/us-states-red-alert-measles-outbreak-kills-infects.html"&gt;most infectious diseases known to man&lt;/a&gt;, able to infect nine out of ten unvaccinated people that are exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr David Persse, chief medical officer for Houston, urged people to get vaccinated against measles to slash their risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from measles is through vaccination,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine is safe, highly effective, and remains the best defense against this potentially severe disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Although measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, international travel continues to present a risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Staying up to date on vaccinations helps protect both individuals and the broader community.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 92 percent of kindergarteners across Texas were vaccinated against measles in 2023 to 2024, the latest data available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is below the 95 percent level experts say is needed to prevent an outbreak, and below the levels recorded in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the Houston area, three of its private schools are among those with the lowest vaccination rates in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acton Leadership Academy of Magnolia, north of the city, had a measles vaccination rate of 36 percent in 2023 to 2024, according to state data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acton Academy Cy-Fair, in northwest Houston, had a measles vaccination rate of 50 percent for kindergarteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a stock image of the skyline in Houston, Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Acton Leadership Academy of Creekside, in Spring, also had a measles vaccination rate of 50 percent for the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two cases recorded in the city in January were in two unvaccinated adults living in the same household who had recently returned to the city from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their cases also were not linked to the major outbreak in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is one of the most infectious diseases known to man, and can infect nine in every ten people exposed to it who are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It spreads via respiratory droplets expelled in coughs and sneezes that hang in the air and remain infectious for up to two hours after a patient has passed through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms erupt seven to 14 days after infection, and begin as a high fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients also suffer from a red, blotchy rash that starts on the face and then extends behind the ears and down the trunk to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Serious complications can occur in young children or those with a weakened immune system, who may suffer from pneumonia, brain swelling and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles has a fatality rate of one to two children in every thousand who are infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The best way to prevent the infection is to be vaccinated, with the first dose given around six months and the second at the ages four to six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for the disease includes providing medications to help relieve symptoms and bed rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Your body adjusts, but it's a wonky time,' Pamela explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The thing with menopause, and perimenopause, is our bodies change, and it may not be comfortable in the beginning, some women can have hot flashes and other kinds of symptoms that are annoying, but they pass for most women, it's a transitional stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It doesn't last forever, and we're getting smarter now about menopause, and we're getting more educated, and most women in menopause do really well with estrogen and testosterone - with your hormones that they're losing during menopause - and when we get estrogen replaced, of which we naturally lose, it's like getting an incredible boost to shock.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pamela Madsen, a somatic sex educator, revealed what sex is like after menopause&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She said women are 'starving' and need to be fed before the work begins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pamela also called menopause a 'second adolescence' for women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'If you give her an estrogen testosterone cream, she's right back in the game. Pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People should consult their doctors, but in my experience of working with so many mid-life women, they don't even need a lot of hormone replacement. They just need a little help.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pamela broke down her Back to the Body retreats that allow women to get in touch with their sexual selves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said many women join her program who have had inadequate lovers or lovers who have never cared about their sexual needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They come in starving. So before we can get anywhere in helping them cultivate their erotic energy, we go through, literally, a period of feeding because they're so hungry,' she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The work, initially, with a menopausal woman, is getting her out of erotic poverty and getting her to a place where she's not starving anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And then once we get her there, then we can support women to go even deeper into what is possible for themselves, erotically, like, "What turns you on? What do you want?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have women say to me, no one has ever asked me that question before. What do I want? A lot of the work with women is about helping them find their desire, taking them out of starvation, and letting them know that this is important for their overall health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She further explained that despite what the media might tell you- women have 'ever-growing eroticism' even after menopause&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pamela further explained that despite what the mainstream might tell you - women have 'ever-growing eroticism' even after menopause.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/menopause/index.html" id="mol-2a5d1eb0-0378-11f0-a7db-e5eee6e4215c"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; as the tombstone of women's erotic lives is a fallacy,' she detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's why you're reading a lot now, as social norms have expanded, that older women are dating younger men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And why are they dating younger men? Because their sexual capacity after menopause grows and older men sometimes can't keep up with us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So the perfect erotic match often can be the older woman and the younger man. He has the capacity to keep up with her ever-growing eroticism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continued: 'Now, I'm not saying that we should just all be with older men. I'm saying that the phenomenon of older women with younger men makes erotic sense.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The sex expert then broke down another reason why younger men are more enticing.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Women in menopause are not necessarily looking for the rich man, as &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/cher/index.html" id="mol-2a5d1eb1-0378-11f0-a7db-e5eee6e4215c"&gt;Cher&lt;/a&gt; said to her mother, "Mom, I am the rich man.’’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pamela runs Back to the Body which has retreats that allow women to get in touch with their sexual selves&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Something about that made me change the sense of where "I am financially independent. I'm not looking for that." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The menopausal woman is looking for a man who's a companion. She's looking for a man who can meet her erotically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She's often looking for a man who wants to travel and do things with her. She's not looking for someone to support her and make babies. She's interested in sexual freedom. She's interested in exploration. She's interested in using up all that incredible erotic energy that's in her body before she takes it in her box. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And what's true is that women's 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s are looking pretty hot, and they're feeling pretty hot.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 14:27:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQc202c1dTOTdHOUMyeFdndDZHSzEtY1prb3VtYWsteHhGUFZLSVB3Wm1ud2dZN3J5UHp0S01VZmhYenIxZDEtV3VTWVgtcm5FYlZ1aFV4dHVHTHpIemQwUXdVeTVZNlJHMlBPX2JEX3VwU01tUnpXc1ZiWnoxeWJUYU1rdmFRNXAzbkFUMmY2dGUyZzFNWWFkUGN3azHSAaIBQVVfeXFMUEtVZ2dyQXZUR2hSRjRiRHBoMklDaThoUTFiNUxOTU00RWtrenlnN3ZTcXZhdmJ0UUVBX05wODNmUlBvc29OY1NFVTM3X0FEVnFxajA3dFJhV1p2U0pnU2YwaDlkVEh5dVNMc0x3OEJxMnNGTE44dUJITVVUMUFQOFluTU14S2FyeTA1UnRoYmc3SkRSMnNvLWdkUmxvcWREMG53</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr., Measles: When does vitamin A help?

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbm6s003phvm08dj07lyd@published"&gt;Measles is back. After the disease was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;declared eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in the United States in 2000, it was easy to feel like it was gone for good. But “eliminated” means there was no ongoing local spread. It’s not the same as “eradicated.” With &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;a few dozen cases&lt;/a&gt; popping up here and there each year, as soon as vaccination rates dip, the illness rears can rear its ugly head once more—just as it is right now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbpsb000o3b73rgnpxow5@published"&gt;People have &lt;a href="https://gidmk.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-vaccines"&gt;mostly forgotten&lt;/a&gt; how bad measles can be. In a world where vaccination rates are typically above 95 percent, it’s incredibly rare to see even a single hospitalization for the condition. But, now, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/health/measles-outbreak-map.html"&gt;as outbreaks spread&lt;/a&gt;, parents across the country are desperately looking for a way to protect their children from an infection with a fatality rate of around 1 in 1,000. That might sound low, but compare it to COVID-19 in 2020 in children age 5: It’s around 100 times more deadly. And for kids who survive measles, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;there can be other nasty complications&lt;/a&gt;. For example, there is evidence that for some kids measles &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aay6485"&gt;permanently damages the immune system&lt;/a&gt;, leaving them more vulnerable to other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbptp000p3b73bou8d6a2@published"&gt;The obvious way to protect your family is simple: vaccination. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is one of the safest medical interventions we have and provides extremely good protection against the disease. But Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new head of the Department of Health and Human Services, &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/05/health/measles-rfk-vitamin-a-misinformation/index.html"&gt;has suggested&lt;/a&gt; that vitamin A supplements are just as useful as vaccines. “Studies have found that vitamin A can dramatically reduce measles mortality,” he &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;wrote in an op-ed for Fox News&lt;/a&gt;. “Good nutrition remains a best defense against most chronic and infectious illnesses.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbpv9000q3b73i9j8yeuv@published"&gt;Unfortunately, the idea that good nutrition is a “best defense” simply isn’t true. You can eat a remarkably healthy diet and still become very ill. Vitamin A supplements do have some benefits—but they won’t protect your children from measles.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbpwy000r3b73j074vois@published"&gt;First, there is a &lt;em&gt;grain&lt;/em&gt; of truth to the idea that vitamin A can be a useful tool when it comes to measles. The vitamin is a molecule that your body uses for a wide range of purposes. One of the main things that it does is help you mount an effective immune defense. We have &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/41782/WHO_MONO_57_(part3).pdf"&gt;known for decades&lt;/a&gt; that people with very low vitamin A levels are at much higher risk of suffering and dying from many infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbpyp000s3b73adn7w1yu@published"&gt;To put it simply (in fact, perhaps too simply!): Vitamin A &lt;em&gt;deficiency&lt;/em&gt; causes you to be &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; vulnerable to infectious disease, including measles. Correcting that deficiency solves this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq09000t3b73b9u039lf@published"&gt;There are a number of studies from the ’80s and ’90s to back up this idea. &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199007193230304"&gt;A famous study&lt;/a&gt; found that a vitamin A supplement for children who were admitted to the hospital with measles reduced the risk of those kids dying by nearly 80 percent. &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008524.pub3/full"&gt;A 2017 review&lt;/a&gt; that aggregated a range of trials together did not show a benefit for mortality, but did find that the vitamin reduced the risk of children having a diagnosed case of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq1q000u3b73w17mqpe9@published"&gt;These studies are why vitamin A supplementation is still recommended as a treatment for children who are hospitalized with measles. But the problem is that they don’t really have all that much relevance to children in the United States today. The famous study I mentioned above was conducted in 1987 in Cape Town in a mostly Black population at a time when the apartheid regime still held sway. The studies aggregated together in the 2017 review were mostly conducted in China, India, and Africa in the ’80s.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq34000v3b73rwrxsowx@published"&gt;In most of these settings, vitamin A deficiency was not just common—it was ubiquitous. Some of these countries had deficiency rates above 20 percent. Meanwhile, the most recent and robust data we’ve got, &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(23)06551-6/pdf"&gt;from the ’90s&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that fewer than 1 in 100 children in the U.S. have a vitamin A deficiency. Some &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297552"&gt;even more recent data&lt;/a&gt; puts the rates even lower, although that study was mostly looking at pregnant women. This is perhaps not surprising in a world where you can get enough vitamin A dining exclusively on the McDonald’s menu.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq4m000w3b739refw3pi@published"&gt;We also know that vitamin A supplements are unlikely to help kids who have enough vitamin A. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM199010043231401"&gt;a massive 1990 study&lt;/a&gt; conducted in India showed that vitamin A supplements reduced the risk of kids dying from measles and other infectious diseases by more than half. However, all of this benefit was in children who showed very obvious signs of malnourishment, like stunted growth or skin clinging to their bones. Those kids had an 89 percent reduction in their risk of death.  Children who were not malnourished had no reduction in risk at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq61000x3b732xjxjuhr@published"&gt;Also, things are actually little more complicated than “If you have a vitamin A deficiency, a supplement can protect against measles.” One of the largest trials ever conducted—in over 1 million children—&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673612621254?via%3Dihub#abs1"&gt;took place in northern India&lt;/a&gt; in the ’00s and calls that straightforward idea into question. In this region, vitamin A deficiency was very common. The study randomly allocated kids to either get a very high-dose vitamin A supplement or a placebo medication once every six months. At the end of the trial, death rates from measles and a variety of other diseases were the same, although the rate of vitamin A deficiency had dropped drastically in the supplement group. There was also no difference in the rate of diagnosed measles between vitamin A and a placebo in this massive trial.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq7f000y3b73kswqh9xi@published"&gt;This seems to conflict with the evidence from the ’80s and ’90s that was summarized in the 2017 review I discussed above, but if you look closer, it makes sense. While vitamin A deficiency was still quite common in India in the ’00s—the study found rates of 10–15 percent without supplementation—the situation was still much better than it was two decades earlier. (&lt;a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/72/4/330.abstract?casa_token=6UIl_iLFC94AAAAA:DcPRkDIpBdQhoafNY8FrndWv5x7RqT-tx71w7dE2iJaufNf1lDy-b6akTqP3wGB1tI7kS_mu_6M"&gt;For example, a study in 1993&lt;/a&gt; showed that rates of eye disease caused by vitamin A deficiency were 22 percent in Uttar Pradesh, where this large randomized trial was later conducted.) The point is that the more modern evidence does not seem to show as much benefit for vitamin A supplementation for measles (though there are benefits for other things). This could be because the rate of severe malnutrition has dropped globally since the first of these studies were conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq8x000z3b732btlrmcb@published"&gt;It’s also worth noting that none of these studies have tested the sort of supplement that you can buy in a supermarket or pharmacy. Most store-bought vitamin A supplements have somewhere between 300 and 1,500 micrograms of the substance in them. The average amount used in these studies—which, remember, are of kids with severe deficiency—is about 30,000 micrograms. That’s between 20 and 100 times higher than your average multivitamin.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbqab00103b73gg0nkvbz@published"&gt;If you live in an area with severe malnutrition, where kids are literally starving on the streets, then a vitamin A supplement is probably a good way to reduce your child’s risk of extremely nasty disease. But if you live in the U.S., where fewer than 1 in 100 kids have low vitamin A levels and even fewer have a true deficiency, the supplements probably aren’t going to do very much.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbqcb00113b733jnnny3w@published"&gt;Yes, your immune system can function better when you are not malnourished, but the best way to protect against measles is vaccination. Really, it’s not even an either/or proposition—feed your kids &lt;em&gt;and also&lt;/em&gt; get them vaccinated. We got rid of the disease for 25 years. There’s no need to bring it &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But, she adds, it could present “an important opportunity for ownership – otherwise we are always left in the hands of others”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;She worries about the impact of cuts to funding on younger scientists, with their potential loss from the research field “a major threat for the next generation”. But, she adds, the HIV community is “powerful and very resilient”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There have already been calls for new ways of doing things.

PE is a medical emergency and needs to be treated immediately to avert death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ten hours into her flight from Toronto to Dubai, Emily Jansson got up from her window seat to use the lavatory. While waiting in line, she coughed weakly twice before collapsing, suffering a pulmonary embolism—life-threatening blood clots in her lungs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Jansson, who revealed her case on TikTok, was shocked by the incident, saying she had the 'heart of an athlete' because she regularly did long bike rides and cardio-intense workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not common to suffer a pulmonary embolism on a flight, with the complication affecting around one in 40,000 passengers on long-haul flights that exceed 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 900,000 people are diagnosed with PE in the US every year, with about 10 to 30 percent of patients dying within a month of diagnosis, according to the American Lung Association. It is ranked as the third-leading cause of cardiovascular death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most cases, the condition is caused by a blood clot from the legs, called a deep vein thrombosis, traveling to the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Jansson also revealed that she was wearing compression socks, which Dr Bhatt said were not recommended for healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: &lt;span&gt;'There's no evidence that in the context of people that are otherwise healthy that wearing these things on flights reduces blood clots, which is why I don’t generally recommend them for people.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But for people who have had certain blood clots that damage the veins 'we might recommend the socks to prevent swelling in the leg'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'At the minimum, in the seat, keep your legs moving and flex your ankles.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor also said it was important to stay hydrated on flights, which can also reduce the risk of clots forming by preventing blood from thickening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Emily Jansson, who landed on her face when she passed out, was also using hormonal birth control, which raises the production of certain clotting factors in the liver while reducing the production of proteins that help prevent excessive clotting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'In addition to getting up every couple of hours, it's important to stay well hydrated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It reduces the risk of blood clots forming in the vein, especially in the legs, which can break off and go to the lungs.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Deepak Bhatt, a top cardiologist at Mount Sinai, told DailyMail.com that getting up from one's cramped airplane seat and walking up and down the aisles for a few minutes can prevent potentially fatal blood clots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also warned against drinking alcohol on flights, saying this was a diuretic and would prompt the body to lose water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even just a single drink, it’s not the end of the world, but it doesn't help the cause. You definitely do not want to drink alcohol for a variety of reasons,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And no one needs another drunk person on a flight.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Jansson, who had been traveling with her husband, said she had not moved on the flight for ten hours because it was very busy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘People are sleeping or eating. On top of that, they don’t really encourage you to get up and walk on flights and then there’s often turbulence so you have to be seated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Still, I wish I had gotten up to move around much more.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Staying seated for extended periods can increase the risk of blood clots that travel from the legs to the lungs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sitting in a cramped airline seat restricts blood flow to the legs and back to the heart while the muscles in the legs that normally pump blood back to the heart are inactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sitting in a cramped airline seat restricts blood flow to the legs while the muscles in the legs that normally pump blood back to the heart are inactive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Jansson's history of having a minor procedure to reduce varicose veins in her legs may have contributed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was also taking hormonal birth control, which increases the production of certain clotting factors in the liver while decreasing the production of anticoagulant proteins, which normally help prevent excessive clotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 30 percent of people who experience PE do so a second time or more. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Jansson will undergo additional blood tests to ensure she won’t experience another clot. The risk is highest within six months of experiencing the first one. She is also taking blood thinners to prevent her blood from clotting again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the residual trauma of reaching the cusp of death continues to give her anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘I was petrified flying home but it helped having my husband with me. I was afraid to go to the bathroom and lock the door so I had him stand guard outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I have some stuff to work through for sure.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PE is relatively common, affecting roughly 900,000 and ranking as the third-leading cause of cardiovascular death. The top two are coronary artery disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 100,000 people who experience PE die, and doctors told Ms Jansson that she survived a ‘catastrophic event.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I felt so grateful to be alive,’ Ms Jansson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 13:03:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>The 2,000-calorie-a-day diet that helps you shed body fat - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE5CZUlWb2ZJNEZ1dFk1MHZyYzk1bkdZLTdLZVF0M1F1OVNPbnFMWTlkR0llYV9tR1AwSHF2eGczLVRUTmx4QVBnYXdhTy10VVBhYVFQN3hZU0ZqQ2ljNmZrbGF3ZmR4M3F3eks5REhVWlFybnFTZHVfclkxVmZUdHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The health benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;1. Weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volunteers who followed the NiMe diet lost 1.4 per cent of their body weight over three weeks, according to the results published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. For example, this would mean the typical man in the UK losing 2.5lb and the average woman losing 2.2lb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weight loss was despite participants eating the same number of calories as they usually would (around 2,500 calories for men and 2,000 for women).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A potential explanation would be that calories from whole plant foods are not as easily accessible by our digestive enzymes,” Prof Walter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;2. Improved heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood tests revealed that levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, also known as “&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/reduce-cholesterol-without-statins/"&gt;bad cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;” because it builds up in the arteries and raises the risk of heart attacks and stroke, decreased by 17 per cent after three weeks on the NiMe diet, results showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also a 14 per cent reduction in C-reactive protein – a marker for inflammation and heart disease, Prof Walter noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;3. Lowered Type 2 diabetes risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood sugar decreased by 6 per cent among those following the NiMe diet, Prof Walter said. Blood tests also revealed an increase in indole-3-propionic acid – a metabolite that has been shown to protect against Type 2 diabetes and nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;4. Enhanced gut health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On a Western diet low in dietary fibre, the gut microbiome degrades the mucus layer in the gut, which leads to inflammation,” Prof Walter explains. In contrast, the high-fibre NiMe diet helps to maintain this barrier which, in turn, reduces inflammation, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study found that those following the NiMe diet had an increase in short-chain fatty acids in the gut, which help with digestion and immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;5. Lower cancer risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A low-fibre diet can force gut microbes to ferment (break down) protein because there is not enough fibre for them to ferment. “This generates harmful by-products that likely contribute to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/colon-cancer/"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;,” Prof Walter explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the study found that the NiMe diet increased carbohydrate fermentation in the gut, at the expense of protein fermentation, which reduced levels of metabolites linked to cancer, such as secondary bile acids and 8-hydroxyguanine, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the NiMe diet is very high in fibre, it can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, similar to other dishes high in onions or beans, such as bloating and gas, Prof Walter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These symptoms vary among individuals,” he notes. “The diet might therefore not be the right choice for individuals that are intolerant to fibre.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to incorporate the NiMe diet into your life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I follow the diet and I stick to it as much as I can,” says Prof Walter. He does the food shop for his household and sticks to buying ingredients that fit within the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He found it difficult to stop eating, for the most part, cheese and processed meats, though he found it easy to give up ultra-processed foods. “But I still struggle with being too busy, so at lunch time, I still often have a sandwich, which would not be NiMe,” Prof Walter notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Who should follow the diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The data shows that the NiMe diet reduces risk indicators of important chronic diseases, including &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/diabetes/body-type-2-diabetes-symptoms-risk/"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease and cancer,” Prof Walters says. “So everyone who wants to stay healthy should benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A longer lifespean and more years spent in good health have been linked to healthy dietary patterns that are in line with the NiMe approach, he notes.

There may be a reason why you need them long term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, if you're worried about any side effects or rebound withdrawal, please make sure you mention it to your doctor.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acid reflux, or heartburn, happens when stomach acid travels up towards the throat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If it continues over long periods of time, it's known as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, which is usually caused by a weakness in the muscles connecting the food pipe with the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GPs have long warned that while pills like omeprazole and lansoprazole can beat heartburn symptoms quickly, ideally they should be used for only a month or two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the studies are few, some have also shown staying on the drugs long term may raise the risk of developing the bone-thinning condition osteoporosis by up to 20 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Drugs, like omeprazole and lansoprazole, help to reduce the amount of acid inside the stomach, limiting the distressing symptoms of reflux, also called heartburn— including pain and difficulty swallowing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Some with reflux suffer the 'silent' type, which is much more difficult to diagnose. Symptoms usually consist of dry coughing and frequent throat clearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because the drugs hinder the stomach’s ability to absorb calcium — a mineral that is vital for healthy bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taking them for extended periods may also lead to other nutrient deficiencies, such as B12, essential for healthy blood cells and nerve function, and, in rarer cases, even stomach cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PPIs, however, were not the only medication Dr Elbary warned may result in 'severe withdrawal symptoms'.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Venlafaxine, which belongs to a group of antidepressants called serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs, 'is one of the hardest ones to come off', he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is why, despite it being very effective, is very rarely given first,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, such side effects, can include headaches, feeling anxious and tired, and difficulty falling asleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2019, NHS watchdog the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also changed its guidelines to acknowledge that for some patients, severe side effects of coming off antidepressants can last 'months or more' with symptoms such as confusion, anxiety, sweating, sleep problems and 'altered feelings'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; But Dr Elbary also said that sedative medication benzodiazepines, known as 'benzos', like lorazepam or diazepam 'can have&lt;span&gt; some of the most dangerous withdrawal symptoms'. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Although the studies are few, some have also shown staying on omeprazole long term may raise the risk of developing the bone-thinning condition osteoporosis by up to 20 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Here's the dilemma. These medications are some of the most effective for treating things like anxiety and insomnia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But you can build up tolerance and dependency to them quite quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This can happen relatively quickly, which is why I'm never really a fan of prescribing these medications at all if I can avoid them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once someone's been on them for a long time, it's extremely hard for them to come off — weaning off them can be very very difficult.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2019, health chiefs urged medics to stop dishing out benzodiazepines so freely as part of a prescribing review due to growing dependency concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Benzos, including Valium, were the go-to insomnia drug for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, however, they have slowly fallen out of favour over addiction fears, severe withdrawal symptoms, and other problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 11:08:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOTzU1VDNpNWxZZFFXT245ZWt0amlCNzgzdFhxeUpfazJmX0RleGVnZDhsbnExNU4xeTV5T1NXZlV5dmoybURpSHZQS3hjeXNCTGloVWVMOUxPMHVKVFh0VXRoellXM1dqaGVBRC03RnM4QTR2V0dFM0NPNTI2SUlXWG16YUJ3NzFDemxLdFNTSlgwSFVvazBWWEx4c0RGeHk3c3pVNFNaNlBVNnloRUHSAbMBQVVfeXFMTlI5ZlVUMzhOQUkyVUxyUTBieFNXUWZSTVl2ci1JVUhDRUVVcXpHRUowaHVKNkFOdVJWR0laSl9JZ0hOajhKei1MUEJYQ3NnX3RFdngxOUdFeEZYZFlqSUotQU1PWFRwNW1neUZvSGhCQklSZnliT0p0S1FpOUs0Rk1RNEJHR05ZbmQzNHAtaU16b1U1NlQzeXB1MlBBVTBIVjI4MzY4RVBPVThxZHNsNHNacHM</guid></item><item><title>Many older people take these vitamins to boost longevity.

Officials &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; the virus’s spread could persist into the spring and summer travel seasons, allowing the virus to reach other parts of the country; more cases and deaths could follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The outbreak has now exceeded the total number of reported measles cases in the US &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, which itself had already represented an increase from 2023. Measles vaccination rates in most US states &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/"&gt;have fallen&lt;/a&gt; below the 95 percent threshold scientists consider necessary to control the disease, and those rates have continued to drop. The Texas emergency appears to have &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c"&gt;begun in an insular religious community&lt;/a&gt; with high vaccination exemption rates; &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-gaines-county-texas-religious-exemptions-cacdae1843fa918964a1b8e01fe757f5"&gt;14 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all children in Gaines County have exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The nation’s health leadership, meanwhile, is undermining the best defense against measles. While US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;paid lip service&lt;/a&gt; to the value of vaccines, he has also &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doctors-push-back-parents-embrace-kennedy-vitamin-texas-measles-outbreak-2025-03-08/"&gt;pitched alternative treatments&lt;/a&gt; unsupported by medical science. He’s also launching new government &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/cdc-research-debunked-link-vaccines-autism-rcna195499"&gt;investigations&lt;/a&gt; into the long-debunked theory linking autism and vaccines — investigations seem designed to erode public trust in the measles shot’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt; at the very moment it is most needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What’s happening right now could only be the beginning. The more the US strays from the public health playbook that helped the country to reach &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html#:~:text=Historic%20achievement,control%20in%20the%20Americas%20region."&gt;official measles elimination in 2000&lt;/a&gt;, the more outbreaks will likely occur — and the bigger they’ll be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We may be entering a new era when this once-dormant virus is again an active threat to people’s health. Here’s what you can do to protect yourself and your family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="you-really-really-dont-want-to-get-measles" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;You really, really don’t want to get measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Most Americans have been lucky enough to live in a world without measles, a disease that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/index.html#:~:text=107%2C500%20lives%20lost%20to%20measles%20worldwide%20in%202023%2C%20mostly%20children."&gt;globally still kills over 100,000 people&lt;/a&gt;, most of them young children. Its risks, therefore, have become largely hypothetical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But for the unvaccinated, those risks are real. Measles is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7188204/#:~:text=Severe%20cases%20of%20measles%20require,1000%20cases%20results%20in%20death."&gt;a formidable and extremely contagious virus&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;dangerous&lt;/a&gt; during the initial infection, which can lead to high fever and the signature measles rash, while some patients will go on to develop pneumonia or encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, both of which can be deadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Measles has a fatality rate of 0.1 percent, but an estimated 20 percent of cases require hospitalization. The disease is particularly threatening to kids, especially young infants, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/health/measles-newborn-pregnancy-risks/index.html"&gt;pregnant women&lt;/a&gt; and people who are immunocompromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some vaccine skeptics, including RFK Jr., &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/rfk-jr-it-would-be-better-if-everybody-got-measles/"&gt;downplay&lt;/a&gt; the risk of measles. “It used to be, when I was a kid, that everybody got measles. And the measles gave you lifetime protection against measles infection,” he said recently on Fox News. But measles was and is not some harmless disease: &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;Between 400 to 500 children&lt;/a&gt; died annually from measles in the US in the decade before a vaccine was introduced in 1963. From 1968 to 2016, there were about 550 measles deaths &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; in the US, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Until the recent deaths in the Texas outbreak, it had been &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/texas-measles-outbreak-death-family/681985/"&gt;10 years&lt;/a&gt; since a single measles death had been recorded in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even those who do survive a measles infection can face long-term health consequences, particularly for those in high-risk groups.

The virus can wipe out more than half a person’s preexisting antibodies that protect them against other pathogens, which can leave them more vulnerable to other diseases for years after their infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In rare cases, measles can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-immune-system-brain-swelling-long-term-rcna195918"&gt;fatal brain swelling&lt;/a&gt; years after the initial infection.

It is perhaps the most effective vaccine we have for any disease, and any risks from the vaccine are &lt;a href="https://x.com/PeterHotez/status/1899778505627385877"&gt;astonishingly low compared to the dangers of measles itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In this new world where you’re more likely to see a measles outbreak in your community, people should consider taking steps to protect their health or that of their loved ones. Here’s what you can do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Parents, if you have young children—the group most at risk from measles — talk to your pediatrician about vaccination. The usual schedule is one shot around age 1 and another shot around age 5, but there is some flexibility. The CDC already &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html"&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt; that infants as young as 6 months can receive one dose if they are traveling internationally, and the recommended age for the second dose ranges from 4 to 6 years old. Several leading public health experts, including former CDC director Rochelle Walensky, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2831828?guestAccessKey=11aca00c-eba0-4515-a778-8658b1948f2e&amp;amp;cmp=1&amp;amp;utm_campaign=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8xNq-9YbIRf2vyGLZcTMVt0EC9kKiRgoZMecFTxqempP2dp4rrCwYJeVQLEgmatVbs4go0RyQUQl9Dx4BOdiZ1E8c1Ag&amp;amp;_hsmi=352150593&amp;amp;utm_content=media_advisory&amp;amp;utm_source=silverchair"&gt;wrote in a recent &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; op-ed&lt;/a&gt; that the recommendations should be updated to advise one shot for infants traveling in the US to areas with higher risk of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Reports of vaccinated people getting sick in Texas have at the same time raised questions about &lt;a href="/health/402025/texas-measles-outbreak-cases-mmr-vaccination"&gt;how protected vaccinated people actually are&lt;/a&gt;. As good as it is, 97 percent effectiveness isn’t 100 percent, and it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to be vaccinated and still get sick. For a small percentage of people, the vaccine simply doesn’t produce immunity. It is also possible that immunity could wane over time, but that was previously not an issue because high vaccination rates had snuffed out the virus’s spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In part because there &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/04/measles-vaccine-shortage-rfk/"&gt;may not be a lot of excess vaccine supply&lt;/a&gt;, the priority should be vaccinating those people who do not have any protection at all: those very young children and the people who weren’t vaccinated as kids. Pregnant women &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-pregnancy/moms-to-be/index.html"&gt;should not&lt;/a&gt; receive the vaccine, but women planning to become pregnant could talk to their doctor about a booster shot; likewise, people with immune conditions &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html"&gt;should talk with their doctor&lt;/a&gt; before getting an additional dose, as the vaccine’s live virus could present a risk depending on their level of immunodeficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Those in high-risk groups may want to take additional precautions, such as wearing masks, if there are reports of measles infections in their immediate area. (That doesn’t just mean the areas of the current outbreak — isolated infections have also been found in &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/la-county-confirms-first-measles-case-in-resident/?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_JrjkkkwQ9HjE95xaA9UB_rUsQjHTPv92TUFbSs6WgBLpIm-9tzeuHX42c-Ap25t5zZqycHTxXPY6xj2V9ZsPtGytFxg&amp;amp;_hsmi=351424356&amp;amp;utm_content=351424356&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/measles-confirmed-case-maryland-howard-county/64111796"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; in people who recently traveled internationally.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For other people who have already been vaccinated but are worried about transmission, it may be reasonable to consider a booster shot. But there are some important steps you should take first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;First, check your vaccination records if you can find them. If you received two doses as a child, you very likely had a successful immune response; only three in 100 people &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html"&gt;don’t&lt;/a&gt;. If you received one dose — as was generally the case before 1989 — you’re probably still good, but it is a little more likely that you never developed immunity, &lt;a href="/health/402025/texas-measles-outbreak-cases-mmr-vaccination"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; Aaron Milstone, an infectious disease pediatrician at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Either way, the next step would be to talk to your doctor. (As always, with anything regarding your health.) They can administer a “titer test” that measures the measles antibodies in your body. If they’re still present — great, you should be good. If they’re not, you may want to ask your doctor about getting an additional measles shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The risks should be kept in context: If you’re not near a confirmed measles case, your personal risk remains negligible. If you’re vaccinated and have antibodies, you are very likely protected from the virus regardless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But they can not be ignored either. Milstone said he and his fellow infectious disease doctors could not believe it when they heard the news in February of a child’s death from measles in the United States of America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“You hope people don’t have to die for others to take this seriously,” Milstone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOY0tiMFNacG9TcTBscDZkMVRNTlZ6dFc5TVJITDRMMmVHUEI3RFRsclF4VUE0SnJFU0VIZjR2bU12cjY4U2NDN0tvN1RWUzNjOWVQeVpYYmhnTHZndDBCdUw1ZXhfeWx6dGRjV1czTU05OE8xZ1pKaHBGTFBqbllFVXlRN3R6OTY0U2JqVGhhTQ</guid></item><item><title>After COVID, Texas is less prepared for the next pandemic - The Texas Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE8xZFVweU1sWFBPUzJfMGc1ODhzNjdkZDl4VzdxXzEzTWxGMkZzOWJfcG4xUmtuUXVCRlV5VDRwZ05DM0pDckx6TTZGWm96TlQyakx0TmZvZ1kyd01td1BoV2Jqb0pVZ2NSQWRBRlJzZUI4b19fWDJkSjhTUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-story-body"&gt;

      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left t-dropcap"&gt;From the moment Steve Young canceled the Milam County Junior Livestock Association show, his days as county judge were numbered.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Young didn’t realize that at the time, of course. It was March 2020, a new virus was rapidly spreading around the country, and politics was the last thing this retired lawyer-turned-cattle rancher was thinking about. He was just doing what he felt needed to be done to keep the 25,000 residents of this rural county 90 minutes northeast of Austin safe.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But the blowback was intense, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“People thought it was just wrong to cancel it, and this was a hoax and it was nothing worse than the flu,” he said in a recent interview. “This thing was highly politicized.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Many in Milam County supported Young as he closed businesses, required masks and turned vacant hospital buildings into a vaccine clinic, eventually offering families $250 to get their teens the shot. But those who opposed him were loud and virulent — he received death threats, and more than one person stormed into the office to yell at him.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Young remembers getting a call from another county official who warned him he was likely costing himself a job.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I said, ‘I understand that, but we need to do this,’” he said. “This is more important than a reelection. And if they don't like it and they want to run against me, then let them have it. In fact, if the guy wants to start tomorrow, tell him to come on.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;After two years of battling COVID-19 and the community, Young lost his seat to the former county Republican Party chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;It’s a story that played out across Texas, in small towns, big cities and all the way up to the governor’s mansion, as elected officials and public health workers became the punching bag for an angry, fearful public unused to government restrictions. Some, like Young, were chased out of public service. Others, like Gov. Greg Abbott, walked back their early support for public health mandates.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas entered the pandemic at a disadvantage, with an unhealthy and uninsured population, an underfunded public health system and workforce shortages across the health care system. While some hoped the pandemic might force improvements, five years after the first Texan died from COVID, many of these long-standing issues have worsened.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Today, Texas spends less per person on public health than it did before the pandemic. Fewer Texans are getting themselves or their kids vaccinated. Local officials have less power to protect their constituents during a health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Dozens of state and local health officials, health care workers, epidemiologists and academics say the hard-earned lessons from COVID have been drowned out by a growing distrust of science, expertise and authority.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;All of this leaves Texas less able and, likely, less willing to robustly respond to the next pandemic, at a time when measles and avian flu are spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“A large group of people in the United States think that everyone in authority, not just the government, are stupid liars, and if you’re smart, you’ll do the exact opposite of what they tell you to,” said Dr. John Hellerstedt, who led the Texas Department of State Health Services during COVID. “This sets us up for catastrophic failure in the face of the next inevitable emergency.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left t-dropcap"&gt;Before COVID, most people were content to ignore public health, blissfully ignorant of the machine that quietly kept them and their community healthy by investigating disease outbreaks, inspecting restaurants, treating sexually transmitted diseases and vaccinating children. The fiscal conservatives at the Texas Legislature were too, typically allocating just enough funding to keep state and local public health authorities from collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In 2020, Texas spent about $20 per person on public health, 39th among the states and Washington, D.C. Local public health agencies operated with bare bones staffing, outdated technology and reduced services. The state agency that filled in the gaps was similarly strapped. Even with constant reminders that something larger was looming — the Ebola scare in 2014, the threat of Zika in 2015, periodic outbreaks of tuberculosis — there simply wasn’t the funding or the time to meaningfully prepare for a widespread crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


  
  

  





    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“You're struggling to do contact tracing on outbreaks of HIV. You’re struggling to reduce maternal mortality. You’re struggling to carry out the ordinary functions of public health,” Hellerstedt said. “It was impossible to think as a government agency you’d have the time or ability to truly model something like a global pandemic response.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In 2019, Hellerstedt came to the Texas Legislature with a prediction as ominous as it was prescient. The state’s “very, very outdated” disease tracking software was at risk of failure, he warned. Without an upgrade, it would “threaten the timeliness of public health’s infectious disease response,” the agency said in its budget request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Legislature appropriated $3.5 million to upgrade the technology. But it was too little, too late.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Before the agency had a chance to implement the changes, COVID hit, and decades of underfunding public health suddenly became a very expensive choice. There weren’t enough employees to do contact tracing. There weren’t clear protocols for acquiring and dispersing personal protective equipment, or setting up testing, or reporting results. And, as Hellerstedt predicted, the state’s disease tracking software quickly became overwhelmed at the moment it was needed most.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The state scrambled to build a new system on the fly, as local agencies relied on homespun trackers to monitor mounting case counts. In Cameron County, on the Texas-Mexico border, public health administrator Esmeralda Guajardo created an Excel spreadsheet and staff went in by hand to reconcile misspellings and double surnames.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We had to piecemeal a lot of stuff because we didn't have the resources,” she said. “But we wanted to make sure that we weren’t duplicating the case counts, because, of course, that affects the trust that people have with us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As Guajardo quickly realized, these case counts were more than just numbers. For a panicked and increasingly restive public, their rise and fall represented hope and devastation. For government officials, the numbers offered cover for difficult decisions: Gov. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/greg-abbott/"&gt;Greg Abbott&lt;/a&gt; justified his stay-at-home orders as based on “data and doctors.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Every time the state corrected the counts or suddenly released a backlogged deluge of positive test results, it introduced another crack in the public’s trust and willingness to comply with the rules. The longer the restrictions went on, the more that crack widened into a chasm.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“People wanted to know that if they complied, the result would get better. They didn’t want to think we didn’t have control over this,” said Mark Owens, a political science professor at The Citadel who ran the UT Tyler/Dallas Morning News poll at the time. “Everyone wanted it to go away, and when they complied and it didn’t, they got frustrated.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Public health agencies, once behind-the-scenes workhorses, became an outlet for the public’s growing anger over business closures, nursing home restrictions, and rapidly changing guidance. In Lubbock County, health director Katherine Wells’ received death threats, requiring police to guard her house.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We’d report the numbers and people would be so angry, saying, ‘Oh you’re just fear-mongering, you’re evil, you’re trying to pick a fight,” said former Milam County public health director Robert Kirkpatrick. “No, sir, I’m just doing my job.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As the death toll rose in hard-hit Cameron County, the distrust began to bleed into everything the public health agency did. Guajardo watched as longtime employees left for less intense, better paying jobs that didn’t have to interface with an angry public, and she couldn’t blame them.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We learned so much going through the pandemic, but then so much of that institutional knowledge walked out the door,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left t-dropcap"&gt;There was, initially, widespread support for mask-wearing, school closures and business shutdowns. But it didn’t take long for that moment of unity to crumble along partisan lines, as Texas’ elected officials joined the call to lift restrictions and reopen the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Texas, things came to a head in May 2020, when Dallas salon owner Shelley Luther was jailed for reopening her business in violation of the state’s shutdown orders. Luther, who is now a state representative, framed the ongoing restrictions as a violation of her personal liberties. U.S. Sen. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/ted-cruz/"&gt;Ted Cruz&lt;/a&gt; and Lt. Gov. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/dan-patrick/"&gt;Dan Patrick&lt;/a&gt;, as well as President Donald Trump, rallied to her cause.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We have the constitutional right to be able to work to provide for our families, to pay our mortgages and I don’t feel it’s right to close us down for this long period of time,” Luther told &lt;a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/coronavirus/dallas-salon-set-to-re-open-despite-county-state-orders/2356298/?fbclid=IwAR3HbmK3tMRasihPY09SY2qrMkeHoPTqi4dF8WCEuG_sbz5Gk_HTEDXSePs"&gt;local news outlets at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Facing pressure from the right, Abbott quickly removed the enforcement mechanism from his orders and allowed some businesses to reopen sooner than expected. He later went even further, forbidding cities, counties and school districts from implementing their own mask mandates.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;A group of local leaders, incensed by what they saw as an undermining of their public health authority, sued, but the Texas Supreme Court sided with Abbott, saying he had the authority to tell local officials what to do — and what not to do — during a public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Abbott did not respond to an interview request.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Many of these policies have since been enshrined in state law. Legislators have banned cities and counties from enacting mask mandates, closing businesses or schools, or requiring COVID vaccines, and prohibited the mandatory closure of churches and gun stores during an emergency declaration. While some of these laws apply only to COVID, public health experts say the playbook and political fault lines are in place to restrict the response to future disease outbreaks, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Legislature also reined in the amount of time the state can remain under a public health disaster or emergency authorization. These declarations, intended to allow the state government to respond more nimbly to a crisis, can now only remain in effect for 30 days, after which the Legislature or a legislative committee would have to renew it monthly.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It's just this weird, circular, extra, and I think, hindering level of bureaucracy that I am afraid is not going to be helpful for us in the next pandemic,” said Allison Winnike, a Houston-based lawyer with the Network for Public Health Law. “Our public health system will have its hands completely tied.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Some of the post-COVID legislation has been beneficial to public health, Winnike and other experts say. Legislators created a position for a state epidemiologist, strengthened data reporting requirements and funded the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute, which helps state and local leaders anticipate and prepare for the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But the state now spends less per capita on public health than it did before the pandemic, dropping down to fourth worst among states and D.C. Experts worry that the lasting distrust and disempowerment of public health will ripple through future disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I do understand that everything’s political, but public health is truly for everyone,” Winnike said. “It’s one of the basic things to have the conditions to live a healthy life and be protected from disease in your community. And I wish that was what we were bringing forward into the next pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left t-dropcap"&gt;For years, Dr. Peter Hotez watched in horror as more and more Texas families declined to get their children vaccinated, and wondered what, if anything, would reverse this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Then came the pandemic. For a brief moment, Hotez thought this might be the turning point. And it was — just not in the way he’d hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Unfortunately, it got politicized in a way that did the opposite, and has exacerbated anti-vaccine activism in the most horrific way imaginable,” said Hotez, a vaccine expert and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Like everything with COVID, the vaccine didn’t start out so political. “Operation Warp Speed,” the effort to quickly develop a COVID vaccine, launched under the first Trump administration. In &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/12/22/greg-abbott-texas-vaccine/"&gt;December 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Abbott proudly got the shot on camera, touting how “safe and easy” it was.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But as the vaccine rolled out, and employer vaccine requirements with it, some began to chafe against what they saw as an infringement on their medical freedom. Conservatives began to coalesce around opposition to the vaccine, and by the end of 2021, Texas had sued the Biden administration at least four times over vaccine mandates for &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/16/texas-sues-biden-vaccine-mandate/"&gt;health care workers, federal contractors&lt;/a&gt;, l&lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/05/texas-ken-paxton-businesses-vaccines/"&gt;arge employers&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/04/texas-national-guard-vaccine-mandate/"&gt;National Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Texas also barred any state funds from being used to promote the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As vaccination rates began to diverge along partisan lines, COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths did, too. By fall 2021, death rates in counties that voted for Trump were four times as high as counties that voted for Biden, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/03/03/the-changing-political-geography-of-covid-19-over-the-last-two-years/"&gt;Pew Research found&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Texas, this politicized resistance created what Hotez calls the “great COVID tragedy,” the death of more than 40,000 people after vaccines became widely available, 85% of them unvaccinated. These waves of casualties did little to change opinion — by &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/legislative/2022-Reports/Rider-33-Report-COVID-19-Immunization-Distribution-Texas.pdf"&gt;December 2022&lt;/a&gt;, the vast majority of unvaccinated Texans said they were not likely to get vaccinated in the next three months, and the largest percentage said nothing would make them more comfortable with the idea of getting the shot.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Hotez can understand why Texans were anxious about getting a newly developed vaccine, and resistant to mandates. But it didn’t stop there.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“In their zeal to push back against vaccine mandates, which you can kind of understand, they went to the next measure and falsely discredited the effectiveness and safety of vaccines,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Pushback to the COVID vaccine brought a deluge of new people into the anti-vaccine movement, moving this once-fringe political faction into the mainstream of the Republican party. After growing slowly for several years, the number of Texas families opting out of getting their children immunized spiked after 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


  
  

  





    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The consequences have been swift: Texas is currently experiencing its largest measles outbreak in 30 years, one of several vaccine-preventable conditions that’s on the rise as immunization rates drop.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“One of our hospitals has the highest number of COVID patients in the hospital right now than we’d had in probably a year,” Dr. Ron Cook, the Lubbock public health authority and a family physician, told The Texas Tribune in February. “We have the lowest uptake of flu [vaccines] and the highest flu levels. We have lower uptake of pertussis, and we have the highest level [of whooping cough] in nine years, which can be devastating, especially for little ones.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/coverage-by-season/2023-2024.html"&gt;39% of adult Texans&lt;/a&gt; got their flu shot in 2022-2023, the lowest rate since 2017. There was a slight improvement in 2023-2024, the latest data available, but Texas remains below the national average. The U.S. is experiencing its worst flu season since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Influenza can easily mutate into something much more dangerous than the seasonal flu, especially with H5N1, or avian flu, currently spreading among animals. If avian flu mutated in a way that was widely transmissible between humans — “That’s how pandemics arise,” said Catherine Troisi, an epidemiologist at UTHealth Houston School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It’s really helpful in preventing the emergence of a totally new influenza virus we haven’t seen before if people are vaccinated against seasonal flu,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;This vaccine hesitancy doesn’t just increase the odds of another pandemic, Troisi said, but also how quickly we could stop it once it's here.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Let’s say that H5N1 does become more transmissible from person to person. We probably could have a vaccine ready pretty quickly,” she said. “But would anybody take it? That’s the big question.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left t-dropcap"&gt;When Hellerstedt looks back on Texas’ handling of an unprecedented global pandemic, he sees successes. Hospitals stayed open, staffed and largely able to keep up with increased demand. The state helped get millions of vaccines into arms. There was good communication between local, state and federal partners.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The failure, he says, was communication with the public. As guidance changed, restrictions were lifted and reinstated, and a novel vaccine was rolled out, leaders at every level of government failed to bring the public along, explaining what they knew and how they knew it and, most importantly, what they didn’t know and what might change once they figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Better communication wouldn’t have cut the number of deaths in half, he said. “But we would still have the confidence of the American people in the only institutions that have the authority and the capability and the capacity to shepherd them through an emergency,” he said. “And the loss of that is a very serious risk to our national security.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Hellerstedt thinks Texas, under Abbott, did better than most. Unlike Young in Milam County, Abbott survived reelection, despite challenges from the right and left, and has &lt;a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/set/greg-abbott-job-approval-trend"&gt;regained some of the popularity&lt;/a&gt; he lost during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But the real test will be in Texas’ handling of the next public health crisis, which is already here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Measles is spreading rapidly across West Texas, with well over 200 people infected over the course of 50 days and one young child dead. Based on Texas’ declining vaccination rates, the worst is yet to come, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As leaders in West Texas scramble once more to stand up contact tracing, testing and vaccine sites, and quarantine plans, they find themselves &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/10/rural-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;still without the resources&lt;/a&gt; they need to address a disease outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The state and federal government have stepped in to help, but top leaders, including Abbott, have hardly addressed the outbreak in public, let alone encouraged vaccination. Conservative Fort Worth Rep. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/nate-schatzline/"&gt;Nate Schatzline&lt;/a&gt; posted &lt;a href="https://x.com/NateSchatzline/status/1897783600499593727?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet"&gt;a video on X&lt;/a&gt; lauding the low vaccination rates at his children’s school, celebrating that they “honor the wishes of moms and dads over any type of health official.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;This leaves local health officials to battle both measles and the lasting distrust of a pandemic-weary public. There’s been some increased uptake at vaccine clinics since the death was reported, Cook, in Lubbock, said, but there’s also been rampant misinformation, public resistance and even the threat of mass infection events like measles parties.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We have plenty of vaccines, we’re figuring out the logistics, but if we can’t get people to take it, this is just going to get worse,” he said. “People forget how bad this can be … We still have COVID deaths. We still have flu deaths. And now, measles deaths.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Unlike COVID, there’s a safe, effective measles vaccine already on the market, which will prevent this from becoming a pandemic. But, public health experts say, there will be a next pandemic at some point, possibly sooner than we realize. And no matter the crisis, be it a regional outbreak or a global pandemic, Texas will need the trust and cooperation of the public to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;It’s clear from this outbreak, public health experts and front-line responders say, that trust has been tested and, in too many cases, has disappeared entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I’m afraid if we have another pandemic, it would be worse,” Guajardo said. “Not because of the pandemic itself, but because of people choosing to believe what they want.”&lt;/p&gt;

Is that true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@emo_swiftie_13/video/7392991825021177134" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;a video on TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, a woman waves a plastic water bottle containing chia seeds, lemon juice and water in front of the camera. She’s on her fourth day of drinking the gloop, she says. “Let me tell you something,” she adds, “this is, like, the realest thing I’ve ever learned on the internet. I am the most constipated person I know,” but since drinking the chia seeds, she continues, she has “never been so regular.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It’s a familiar line on TikTok, where views for many videos about “&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=internal%20shower&amp;amp;t=1741126636846" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the internal shower&lt;/a&gt;,” as the drink has been called, number in the millions. Chia seed water is made from simple ingredients: just a tablespoon or two of chia seeds, water and perhaps &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@reeganpawlicki/video/7395252307555929386" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;a squeeze of lemon juice for taste&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the drink &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rachellldaguanno/video/7413433122156514566" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;has been said&lt;/a&gt; to have big benefits, including helping with bloating, bowel irregularity and even weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;To a certain extent, these claims are true, said Amanda Lynett, a dietitian specializing in gastroenterology and hepatology at Michigan Medicine. Thanks to the high fiber content, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/well/eat/chia-seeds-benefits.html" title=""&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; are one of her go-to dietary recommendations for people who struggle with constipation, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But you don’t have to chug them in water to enjoy their benefits. Experts say that no matter how you consume chia seeds — whether sprinkled onto oatmeal or yogurt, or mixed into puddings, baked goods or smoothies — they’ll still help your digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-9b09b8c"&gt;What does the research suggest?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When asked if any studies had examined whether chia seeds could reduce constipation, the experts said they weren’t aware of any. But there’s good research in general showing that dietary fiber — an essential nutrient abundant in chia seeds — &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/23/well/eat/constipation-treatment-laxatives.html" title=""&gt;can help&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Now, one mom is detailing her daughter’s hospitalization just minutes after consuming the popular drink to send a warning to other parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Kim Moore — from Lancashire, England — took her daughters Marnie, 4, and Orla, 6, to a children’s party, where she bought them refillable slushies. After 10 minutes, her youngest daughter fell unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 35-year-old told Kennedy News and Media via the &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14506497/toddler-unresponsive-glycerol-toxicity-slushy-drink-danger.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daily Mail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Marnie was “pale and unresponsive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We ended up buying two one-litre refillable cups and they were going off playing, eating, getting drinks and coming back but Marnie didn't drink the full cup, probably only half,” she recalled. "Then about 10 minutes later, she started getting really aggravated then she started falling asleep so I just thought she was over-tired.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was only five minutes later when I tried to wake her up that I realised she wasn't waking up and was actually unconscious,” she told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News and Media&lt;/p&gt; KIM MOORE, 35, WITH HER TWO DAUGHTERS MARNIE MOORE AND ORLA MOORE&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore tried to shake the toddler awake but with no luck, rushed her to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it was mum's instinct that I knew something wasn't right,” she told the outlet. “She was floppy and completely unconscious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After arriving at the hospital, doctors discovered that Marnie’s blood sugar levels were dangerously low, and transferred her to another hospital, where she remained for three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had no clue what had caused it. She was unconscious for around 25 minutes while they brought her blood sugars up,” Moore said. "In hospital, she screamed out in agony saying her head hurt and threw up everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore was later told that her 4-year-old was suffering from glycerol toxicity as a result of consuming the slush ice drink, which contained the sweetener glycerol. Many slushies contain glycerol because it gives the drink its “slushy” texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of glycerol toxicity include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, confusion, decreased consciousness, low blood sugar levels and low levels of potassium in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/at-least-21-children-hospitalized-after-drinking-slushies-with-glycerol-11695313" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:At Least 21 Children Hospitalized After Drinking Slushies with Common — and Legal — Ingredient, Study Finds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;At Least 21 Children Hospitalized After Drinking Slushies with Common — and Legal — Ingredient, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News and Media&lt;/p&gt; Marnie Moore in the hospital at age 4&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Looking back, she had every single symptom of glycerol toxicity,” Moore admitted. "I was in absolute fear. If I hadn't taken her to hospital, it may have had a different outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore said her daughter was able to recover after three days in the hospital. She is now sending a warning to other parents, urging them to not allow their young children to consume the slush ice drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So many places promote free slushies when you play there but you're promoting poison,” she told the outlet. “I don't think these slushies should be allowed at all. I personally wouldn't allow my child to drink one at all. It's not a risk I'm willing to take.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think they should be sold to kids 12 and under in all honesty,” she said. “I wouldn't wish what we went through on our worst enemy. It was awful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-puzzler-8620185" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

According to the study, 93% of the children became unwell “within 60 minutes” of drinking the slush ice drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the results, the ADC has urged children under age 8 to avoid drinking ice drinks containing glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consumption of slush ice drinks containing glycerol may cause a clinical syndrome of glycerol intoxication in young children,” they wrote. “This mimics inherited disorders of gluconeogenesis and glycerol metabolism. Clinicians and parents should be alert to the phenomenon, and public health bodies should ensure clear messaging regarding [this].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/food-additives#glycerol" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food Standards Agency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Food Standards Agency&lt;/a&gt; recommends that children aged 4 years and under should “not consume” slush ice drinks containing glycerol “due to their potential to cause side-effects such as headaches and sickness, particularly when consumed in excess.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glycerol is “generally thought to be safe in humans,” and it is an authorized group I food additive in the EU, under Annex II and Annex III of Regulation (EC) number 1333/2008, per the ADC. However, the organization added that “there is poor transparency around glycerol concentration,” possibly leading to children being hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/4-year-old-completely-unconscious-after-drinking-toxic-slushy-11698511" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxON0dldVZrd3JqX1lPblk4S21maHcwRzk1OHNZei1BVzhzeFotTXNVOTktZy1CdHdabXRQYXExeGRScWNxMTkyUlRPaUZrS0toX3VZVndWMlVLUWdsM1U4V1g4SmRuaWpibTFFNlgzb2owRDhmX0lHUFR6ZnYxeVVaaXhR</guid></item><item><title>Six surprising health benefits of regular walking for seniors - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQelFzU1FUaTVXQnZLOW5zTGw0VmQ2cm1QSkZJaXp5c3ByWWJISWVRRExlUkk1VXlBWlVaV3lyd0RtWVZMVFR2VnhnZEJPX2haaG5MUUdXdm5qcWJ4V2xOZkNpRm8xX0ZVSnM0NF9JYmUtbnZCMVhaR1dCZTVxaTl5MTZlWUZLWkJmS2JpdU5fTlVyQ2M3Y3FsQ1Y5NzFMOXZuSzAyUENnOGdFdGxLQVhuOGJPT29LSFJY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 lkPksW sc-jbiisr-1 hiukpJ" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 cFynzd" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 eFDpwi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 jkkqcL"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dDFcwe"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 kqOtlp"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 bjQKsM"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 hWxisF sc-hez36s-16 gBaKpR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 ifXxYf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 jlvSeZ"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 ghJHgZ"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 bhFQeV"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 gMxIQB"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

Improves cardiovascular health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A regular walk can do wonders for your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It helps lower &lt;a href="/topic/blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, improves circulation, and reduces cholesterol levels,” says Dr Chun Tang, GP at Pall Mall Medical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Plus, it strengthens your heart muscle, making it easier to do everyday activities without feeling out of breath.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Muscle strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="/topic/walking"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; directly stimulates your lower body muscles, including quadriceps, hamstrings, calves and glutes,” says Michael Betts, personal trainer and director of TRAINFITNESS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This regular muscular engagement helps maintain strength and mobility in these key muscle groups, which play a critical role in preserving independence as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your core muscles are also working during walking to maintain posture and balance, so it’s a full-body workout beyond just leg strength.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-none"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 gUxMdg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/17/14/17112131-f6e865f8-35a5-4163-a237-7607a9e39cb8.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/17/14/17112131-f6e865f8-35a5-4163-a237-7607a9e39cb8.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/17/14/17112131-f6e865f8-35a5-4163-a237-7607a9e39cb8.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Walking helps counteract age-related muscle loss" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-24874"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Walking helps counteract age-related muscle loss&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Alamy/PA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking also helps counteract age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This natural form of resistance training creates enough stimulus to maintain and even rebuild muscle tissue when done consistently,” explains Betts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.

Helps strengthen bone and joint health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we get older, some of us are at more risk of osteoporosis, a condition which makes bones weak and more likely to break,” says Dr Nasrin Razzaq, a GP with an extended role in geriatric medicine at Mollison Way Surgery, part of GP Pathfinder Clinics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-none"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 ibpbRH"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/17/14/17112713-cdd19ef0-096b-43bb-b7dd-61887f552db6.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/17/14/17112713-cdd19ef0-096b-43bb-b7dd-61887f552db6.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/17/14/17112713-cdd19ef0-096b-43bb-b7dd-61887f552db6.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Experts say regular walking can reduce the natural decline in bone health" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-24875"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Experts say regular walking can reduce the natural decline in bone health&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Alamy/PA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking helps by strengthening bones as it’s a weight-bearing exercise, meaning your bones support your weight, which encourages bone growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Regular walking also reduces the natural decline in bone strength.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Helps prevent falls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stronger bones mean a lower chance of fractures following a fall, especially in the hips, spine and wrist,” highlights Razzaq. “Walking improves movement and balance by keeping joints flexible and improving balance and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking helps prevent stiffness, making movement easier and strengthens the muscles that keep you steady.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Boosts mood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking releases endorphins and serotonin in your brain which are natural mood-lifters that reduce anxiety and depression,” says Betts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-none"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 rSfrR"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/17/14/17122931-58b325b5-9f71-4a16-bff3-c3bfd46a7b47.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/17/14/17122931-58b325b5-9f71-4a16-bff3-c3bfd46a7b47.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/17/14/17122931-58b325b5-9f71-4a16-bff3-c3bfd46a7b47.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Spending time outdoors in great for the mind" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-24876"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Spending time outdoors in great for the mind&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Alamy/PA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many older adults experience greater mental clarity during and after walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sense of accomplishment from maintaining a walking routine boosts your self esteem and confidence, particularly important as you age and may face other physical limitations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 08:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQelFzU1FUaTVXQnZLOW5zTGw0VmQ2cm1QSkZJaXp5c3ByWWJISWVRRExlUkk1VXlBWlVaV3lyd0RtWVZMVFR2VnhnZEJPX2haaG5MUUdXdm5qcWJ4V2xOZkNpRm8xX0ZVSnM0NF9JYmUtbnZCMVhaR1dCZTVxaTl5MTZlWUZLWkJmS2JpdU5fTlVyQ2M3Y3FsQ1Y5NzFMOXZuSzAyUENnOGdFdGxLQVhuOGJPT29LSFJY</guid></item><item><title>10-Year-Old Girl Dies After Flu Complications Left Her ‘Screaming’ and Unable to ‘Feel Her Legs and Feet’ - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5yaEQ1ZmNveDFMSXhJcTlYT2E3S2JWT05NNGJjQ1FrSGxPbWJoaWlQOHlSNkl1Qjh3c2g5VUtEYV8yaHVsMU44cm5nb2FfMDRBLWJZbTlJeDZTb0NUWktTdkJ0TER5UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/p&gt; Minka Greene White&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Maryland family is mourning after a 10-year-old girl died from complications of the &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/everything-to-know-about-the-flu-from-prevention-to-treatment/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:flu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;, just days after being dismissed from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minka Aisha Greene, a healthy and active elementary school student, was considered the “light” of her family. So, when the 10-year-old started having low energy and a lack of appetite in late January, her mother Kymesha Greene White was immediately concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We noticed her behavior changed because she normally doesn’t get sick. This was like her first time getting sick,” Kymesha &lt;a href="https://www.dcnewsnow.com/news/local-news/maryland/prince-georges-county/family-remembers-10-year-old-who-died-from-flu-in-prince-georges-county/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; DC News Now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kymesha took her little girl to the emergency room and Minka was diagnosed with the flu and a UTI. She was given ibuprofen and sent home to rest. However, Minka started complaining about headaches so her mother took her back to the ER. During the second visit, she was given fluids and sent home again to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minka’s health ultimately took a turn for the worse on the morning of Feb. 6, when Kymesha found her daughter vomiting in bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I heard her screaming, ‘Mommy!’ And I’m like, ‘What’s wrong?’ That’s when she said she couldn’t feel her legs and her feet,” she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/9-year-old-dies-flu-b-buffalo-11685217" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Girl, 9, Dies from Complications from the Flu: 'She Was Too Perfect for This World';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Girl, 9, Dies from Complications from the Flu: 'She Was Too Perfect for This World'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kymesha and her husband David White rushed their daughter, who had not had the flu vaccine, to the hospital. She &lt;a href="https://dailyvoice.com/md/capitol-heights-district-heights/minka-greene-dies-of-from-flu-related-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Capitol Heights Daily Voice that on the way there, one of her daughter’s eyes rolled to the back of her head and her tongue started moving uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Minka stopped breathing. Doctors performed CPR and other life-saving procedures but the parents were later told that their daughter had no brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was the last time I carried her, the last time I held her in my arms. I will cherish that for the rest of my life,” said David.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minka later died on Feb. 10 at the hospital. “We had to let our baby go,” said Kymesha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Minka’s death, the family learned that she suffered severe brain inflammation caused by the flu. They are now sharing their story in hopes of warning other parents. “Advocate for your babies,” Kymesha said. “When they say they’re hurting, tell the doctors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of influenza viruses: &lt;a href="https://people.com/5-year-old-diagnosed-with-influenza-a-temporarily-loses-ability-to-walk-exclusive-11681082" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flu A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Flu A&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/ohio-teen-dies-from-the-flu-days-after-christmas/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flu B;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Flu B&lt;/a&gt;, according to  &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/flu-b-symptoms-identify-treat-and-prevent-5216276" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Verywell Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verywell Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They both cause similar symptoms, like fever, body aches, and coughing. While Flu A is more common and thought to be more dangerous — the outlet reports that it accounted for 97% of cases during the 2022-2023 season — Flu B “symptoms can range from mild to severe.” Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9835412/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institute of Health&lt;/a&gt; reports that “neurological complications occurred in one-fifth of hospitalized children due to influenza.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/children.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:U.S. Centers for Disease Control;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control &lt;/a&gt;says, “Flu can be more dangerous than the common cold for children” and recommends preventative measures — such as vaccination and frequent hand washing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/girl-10-dies-from-flu-brain-swelling-11698306" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 07:32:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5yaEQ1ZmNveDFMSXhJcTlYT2E3S2JWT05NNGJjQ1FrSGxPbWJoaWlQOHlSNkl1Qjh3c2g5VUtEYV8yaHVsMU44cm5nb2FfMDRBLWJZbTlJeDZTb0NUWktTdkJ0TER5UQ</guid></item><item><title>The U.S. measles outbreak is growing.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Measles cases are on the rise in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Pan American Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/30/718220586/is-measles-here-to-stay"&gt;declared the disease eliminated in 2000&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to widespread vaccination efforts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But it's still an issue globally, which means an unvaccinated person could catch the highly infectious disease abroad and bring it back to the United States. And &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/02/1198913177/measles-cases-are-up-and-childhood-vaccinations-are-down"&gt;declining vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in young children, are causing public health officials to worry about the impact of emerging outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's the case in West Texas and New Mexico, where &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309800/texas-measles-child-death-vaccination"&gt;a growing measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; now numbers &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;around 300 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; — more than the total number of measles cases reported in the U.S. in all of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Right now, NPR health correspondent &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/people/348777820/maria-godoy"&gt;Maria Godoy&lt;/a&gt; says that the Texas outbreak is still limited to remote rural areas where vaccination rates are low. But measles is highly contagious – &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread"&gt;more infectious than COVID-19, smallpox, or even Ebola&lt;/a&gt;. So, if an infected person travels to another community with low vaccination rates, that person could potentially sow another outbreak upon returning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interested in other stories about public health?

Sitting on a cushion or blanket will lift the hips, making a cross-legged position easier and more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Uzx8CUvJK5xVmtBwcG6HZG" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Uzx8CUvJK5xVmtBwcG6HZG slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-three-tips-for-meditation"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Three tips for meditation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rowell has shared her top &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/meditation-tips-for-beginners-according-to-a-mindfulness-expert" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/meditation-tips-for-beginners-according-to-a-mindfulness-expert"&gt;beginner meditation tips&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well &lt;/em&gt;below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Start small&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rowell recommends starting with five minutes of meditation before trying longer sessions. You can try meditating alone or watch a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/guided-meditations-for-beginners" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/guided-meditations-for-beginners"&gt;guided meditation &lt;/a&gt;on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Forget trying to empty your mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your mind will feel very busy when you first start meditating, but that's completely normal. Try observing your thoughts without being drawn into them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just let your thoughts come and go and simply practice being still for a little while," says Rowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Don’t give up!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Meditation isn't a quick fix," Rowell explains. "But I guarantee if you stick with it for a few weeks you will feel the impact."&lt;/p&gt;

But during the pregnancy she developed gestational diabetes, so her doctor decided she and her baby would benefit from specialized nutrition counseling and access to food that’s good specifically to counter diabetes. The doctor sent her with a prescription to the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Oswald “Oz” Hutton, 60, of Salt Lake City, has battled hypertension, arthritis and chronic pain. What you eat makes a difference there, too, so the U.S. Marine Corps veteran opted into nutritional education and access to high quality produce courtesy of a program that’s a partnership between the Rockefeller Foundation and the Veterans Health Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Those two programs — and scores of others — are part of the “Food Is Medicine” movement, the belief that what people eat helps determine their health on many levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="5016" data-height="3481"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/BU5AWZNWWVDQZCS4KSW6HH5FY4.JPG?auth=14c80e07d1cc51b2758d0b47026bbdeab210a21a3158f5fc0be3a35302cc36a5&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=555" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/BU5AWZNWWVDQZCS4KSW6HH5FY4.JPG?auth=14c80e07d1cc51b2758d0b47026bbdeab210a21a3158f5fc0be3a35302cc36a5&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1110 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Ellen Maxfield, University of Utah Health clinical operations associate director, grabs food for a patient at the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday, March 14, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“If you think about the drivers of health, dietary risk factors are shown to be the most important modifiable risk factor for chronic disease and death. Yet in health care, we don’t really talk about that much,” said Dr. Amy Locke, whose many titles include chief wellness officer at University of Utah Health, professor and co-director of the Driving Out Diabetes Initiative at the Osher Center for Integrative Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Locke said modifiable health risk factors are about 20% clinical, 30% behaviors like getting enough sleep or eating well, roughly 10% physical environment and 40% socioeconomic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“If you have good health care and you have good socioeconomic status, it’s easier to eat a healthy diet,” she told Deseret News. “What we want to do is use the health care space to leverage those other buckets as much as possible, so we are doing a bunch of ‘Food Is Medicine’-related things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The federal government, health care providers, nonprofits, academics and others are embracing the concept that you can be healthier or sicker depending on what you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2110"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/5RS4DJ7COBCGLCLHRWTWMRSCMA.JPG?auth=85d68d6940628225a1ad5a6740c34463f4f409599611ab039693511b4922f2de&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=562" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/5RS4DJ7COBCGLCLHRWTWMRSCMA.JPG?auth=85d68d6940628225a1ad5a6740c34463f4f409599611ab039693511b4922f2de&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1124 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Sarah Zou, clinical dietician, gives two bags of food to Alma Rivera, who is eight months pregnant and has gestational diabetes, from the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday, March 14, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The 2022 White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health firmly tied together food and health in its call to end hunger and reduce chronic disease by 2030, as the &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/food-medicine" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports. The office said 60% of U.S. adults have some diet-related chronic disease that the right food — and avoiding the wrong ones — can impact. At the same time, there are 18 million people whose households experience food insecurity. The result is an estimated $4 trillion in health care spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Deseret News looked at two of the dozens of examples of “Food Is Medicine” programs. How programs operate and who they target varies. But many of them — including the University of Utah Food Pharmacy and the pilot project funded by the Rockefeller Foundation involving Salt Lake area veterans who receive services at the VA — share certain traits: The beneficiaries like Hutton and Rivera have medical conditions that food impacts. Participants are considered food insecure and meet income qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The programs also both have strong education components to help those benefiting understand why food matters, how to make good food choices and even how easy it is to make good meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;They also both provide actual food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="4499" data-height="3027"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/V4WTC35XARAORNK5C7RRB3TZNI.JPG?auth=1cead1e7257279a72b5868b9d588e221a99151fa449e0ca062f78fdc5ab214df&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=538" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/V4WTC35XARAORNK5C7RRB3TZNI.JPG?auth=1cead1e7257279a72b5868b9d588e221a99151fa449e0ca062f78fdc5ab214df&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1076 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Food is pictured in the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday, March 14, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="Helping-veterans-get-healthy" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Helping veterans get healthy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Veterans Health Administration hosted a bipartisan Congressional event last week to tout its partnership with the foundation, which just made a $100 million commitment to Food Is Medicine programs, building on its prescription pilot projects in Utah and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Projects are being launched in Maryland and New York, with partners including the VA, Instacart, Syracuse University, University of Utah, 4P Foods, as well as in North Carolina, Duke University and Reinvestment Partners. The programs have different designs to meet needs in the areas they serve. But the classes, resources and prescriptions are tailored specifically to patients and their chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Hutton is one of 275 veterans in the Utah pilot; the programs combined hope to help 2,000 veterans, while gathering research and looking for ways to tackle diet-related diseases like diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure among U.S. veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Along with food education, veterans in the program are given gift cards worth $100 a month that can be used to buy fruits and vegetables at participating stores. The program lasts 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Retired four-star U.S. Navy Admiral James Stavridis, foundation board chair, said access to healthy food improves mental and physical health while lowering the cost of health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="5030" data-height="3400"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/IAQQU3EYC5FWPCGFBDZANH4DQ4.JPG?auth=1f22fb218a44f6c37caa187532f291ae6d7048de899758230f2b9e5b681aa63f&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=540" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/IAQQU3EYC5FWPCGFBDZANH4DQ4.JPG?auth=1f22fb218a44f6c37caa187532f291ae6d7048de899758230f2b9e5b681aa63f&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1080 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Sarah Zou, clinical dietician, helps a patient choose groceries at the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday, March 14, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3695271/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has reported that three-quarters of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan were overweight or obese when they first went to a VA clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Noah Cohen-Cline, director of the Rockefeller Foundation initiative, said the program uses Food Is Medicine initiatives like produce prescriptions, meals tailored to medical needs and groceries that can be prescribed by a clinician as part of medical treatment, “with the big-picture goal of seeing these interventions formally integrated into health care as a covered medical benefit.” These pilot projects are testing programs and measuring outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The foundation would love to expand it to all eligible veterans, including 116,000 in Utah, but Cohen-Cline said philanthropies alone can’t meet the need; that requires funding from other sources, including health care systems and insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He said it saves money and improves quality of life, making it a great investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="5181" data-height="3454"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/AM6QSUTRDZGLVBTJM33KXZX44Q.JPG?auth=9d3c9dee36b93b125bbe0394aa91f4a0c7756f7679000477dfc4f8e35b4a802d&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/AM6QSUTRDZGLVBTJM33KXZX44Q.JPG?auth=9d3c9dee36b93b125bbe0394aa91f4a0c7756f7679000477dfc4f8e35b4a802d&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Ellen Maxfield, University of Utah Health clinical operations associate director, and Sarah Zou, clinical dietician, help a patient choose food from the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday, March 14, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="What-is-a-food-pharmacy" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;What is a food pharmacy?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The University of Utah Health System, through its integrative medicine department, teaches students in health-related fields how to talk about food as a wellness tool and also how to eat a healthy diet themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Food is the most significant modifiable risk factor. You should not show up at a medical facility and not have the opportunity to talk about food,” Locke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In the food lab, future health providers learn that good food needn’t be expensive and can be delicious, said Locke. “We have a whole college of health on this campus, which is amazing. We’ve got a dietetics program that’s been teaching people to cook since 1940, so they have a lot of practice. So getting these other health profession students, nurses, physicians, pharmacists in that lab experiencing food in a fun and healthy way is really important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Locke said discussion of food as medicine empowers people to be healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Food Pharmacy program itself is for those in the University of Utah health care medical network who are food insecure and have a food-changeable chronic condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“What’s really cool about the food pharmacy program is that it not only helps people understand what a healthy diet is, but it provides some actual food,” Locke said, adding she was well into her career when she realized knowing about healthy food is great, but you also have to be able to obtain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The coaching piece paired with food and resources, ”that’s where the magic of the food pharmacy program really is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The food pharmacy is “embedded in a clinical space.” A care provider refers patients for nutrition education and provides a prescription for foods that will help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That sends the patient into the program for education, followed by up to six visits to the food pharmacy truck, which alternates between the Greenwood Clinic in Midvale and the Redwood Clinic in Salt Lake City. The truck operates on a limited basis twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="5407" data-height="3529"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/6EA6IQMP7JCZJCX76WVFEVPE3U.JPG?auth=efeb474c5d7f723c0d96cd5bc217a0a0621816b2419d2606f973076a3759c783&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=522" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/6EA6IQMP7JCZJCX76WVFEVPE3U.JPG?auth=efeb474c5d7f723c0d96cd5bc217a0a0621816b2419d2606f973076a3759c783&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1044 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Alma Rivera, who is eight months pregnant and has gestational diabetes, visits the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer for the first time outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday, March 14, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="Resources-education-coaching" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Resources, education, coaching&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Ellen Maxfield, associate director of clinical operations for the integrative health center and director of the University of Utah’s diabetes prevention program, said they don’t try to meet all of a person’s food needs, but rather coach and supplement. Unlike the VA program, it’s not just produce. At the truck, for instance, Rivera chose two dairy items (they had 2% milk, almond milk and yogurt that day), three veggies from a selection of fresh and canned, two proteins (offerings were pinto beans, tuna and peanut butter), two fruits (fresh and canned) and two starches (brown rice, spaghetti, oatmeal and bread).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Food pharmacy patients are given information packets in English and Spanish on resources to community food banks and other programs like farmer’s markets that also help with food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Food resources, education and coaching,” said Maxfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The food pharmacy itself looks like a food truck with lots of refrigerator space and room for Sarah Zou, the pharmacy’s registered dietitian, and health-field students who help fill orders. They’re trained to think about and talk about food as medicine, plus they get experience working with patients. Thanks to translation services, they can help people speaking a wide variety of languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;On the way from a Food Is Medicine appointment, patients can visit the truck and pick their food. Rivera opted for a variety of fresh and shelf stable items; Maxfield said they learn to use both well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Follow-up visits can be done in person or by telehealth to reduce the transportation and scheduling burden. Those following up remotely use a gift card that’s specific to the program to choose certain foods. Kroger provided the cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The program is still small, Maxfield and Locke said, but has served nearly 400 people. They’re learning what works and its impact. But they believe treating food as medicine and helping people understand how what you eat impacts health will have lifelong — and quality of life — effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Said Locke, “This is a piece of a much bigger sort of initiative of, how do we help improve health, and specifically nutrition of people in Salt Lake and in Utah, from school-based programs to teaching kitchens?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="4952" data-height="3076"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/HGMDLKUPARGUFJGU52KKJ623FA.JPG?auth=079c34865a6842385cea23df280666ce60646907232d27221a89137faefb25f8&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=496" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/HGMDLKUPARGUFJGU52KKJ623FA.JPG?auth=079c34865a6842385cea23df280666ce60646907232d27221a89137faefb25f8&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=992 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Food is pictured in the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday, March 14, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="Food-to-share" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Food to share&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The food pharmacy project is housed in the Osher Center for Integrative Health and the Driving Out Diabetes initiative. Patients can get food six times on a doctor’s referral and can repeat if they want, Maxfield said, for a year total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Part of what makes both programs successful is buy-in by local grocers. In Utah, for instance, several grocery stores — including Kroger (Smith’s in Utah) and Lucky have teamed up with the foundation to accept the cards to pay for produce. Maxfield said the university health program is all collaboration, from the student piece to the funding piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The food comes from University Hospital’s Nutrition Care Services, the Utah Food Bank, and Dairy West provides dairy resources and helps fund the truck. Others contribute, too. The program also buys farm shares during the growing season from the International Rescue Committee’s New Roots program. Kroger provides grocery gift cards. And the Driving Out Diabetes Initiative supports the program, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Without all that collaboration, neither program could operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Eating-your-way-to-better-health" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Eating your way to better health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Hutton, who recently graduated from the program, said he’s not only learned what to eat, but what not to eat to maintain healthy blood pressure numbers. “Part of my goal is to eat my way to better health,” he said, noting he not only has had high blood pressure, but arthritis and chronic pain that can be helped by food choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He was already a cook. But he said looking at food as medicine is different. And the cooking class was amazing, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“But classes only take you so far if you can’t afford to buy the produce you want,” the foundation’s Cohen-Cline said. It is in pairing access with knowledge that there’s “a lot of power.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“By eating better, I have energy,” said Hutton, who admits he has a tendency to self isolate. “Now, when I go outdoors, I want to stay outside and do things, to socialize. So one of the least talked about benefits is positive mental health and overall well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It was Rivera’s first Food Pharmacy appointment, so it’s too soon to say how it will help her. But the goal is clear: A healthy baby and a lifetime of food-related health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 03:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNZnI1eERhckl1NjQ2QjdwTGdmeGJVV25lWnFueDRicjdRX2NyTXAzVnpnbGhaVWtJbFNBenVxYVU4Q0UwUTg2eGJPZWRtQlVnczA5TEE5OG5USHNreWdOS3o4cnNkckJDVVVCLUpvRF9xRUQ0Vy1EcXRpVkIzdVIzeFZiUEpTN1RjQlhqX2JnTkhDdmo2MlotdjVmVzI3NFRXWEF5RzUyVDVjd3k4WHJoR3U4cw</guid></item><item><title>Exercise in a Pill?

			&lt;p&gt;Giving blood regularly may not just be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/australian-man-whose-blood-donations-saved-millions-dies-age-88"&gt;saving the lives&lt;/a&gt; of other people, it could also be improving your own blood's health at a genetic level, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers compared samples from 217 men who had given blood more than 100 times in their lives, to samples from 212 men who had donated less than 10 times, to look for any variance in blood health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the differences were subtle, the frequent donors' blood was more likely to have beneficial mutations in a gene called &lt;i&gt;&lt;em&gt;DNMT3A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Other mutations in &lt;em&gt;DNMT3A&lt;/em&gt; have been &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc3895"&gt;previously linked&lt;/a&gt; to blood  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="154791" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work is a fascinating example of how our genes interact with the environment and as we age," &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news-and-features/2025-03-11_beneficial-genetic-changes-observed-in-regular-blood-donors"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="154791" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; biologist Dominique Bonnet, from The Francis Crick Institute in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154794" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154794" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BloodCells.jpg" alt="Blood cells in bone marrow" class="wp-image-154794 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BloodCells.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BloodCells-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154794" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blood cells in bone marrow. (&lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news-and-features/2025-03-11_beneficial-genetic-changes-observed-in-regular-blood-donors"&gt;Hector Huerga Encabo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the team looked at blood  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="154791" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, which produce more blood cells on demand. As we get older, these mechanisms can start to break down, leading to problems with blood cancers such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"&gt;leukemia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood loss triggers the production of the hormone &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin"&gt;erythropoietin&lt;/a&gt;. In lab tests on blood stem cells treated with erythropoietin, the researchers found those with the &lt;em&gt;DNMT3A&lt;/em&gt; mutation produced blood faster than those without the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests frequent blood loss leads to more production of the mutated blood cells. Research in mice shows the &lt;em&gt;DNMT3A &lt;/em&gt;mutation results in healthier blood levels after the stress of blood loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Activities that put low levels of stress on blood cell production allow our blood stem cells to renew and we think this favors mutations that further promote stem cell growth rather than disease," &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news-and-features/2025-03-11_beneficial-genetic-changes-observed-in-regular-blood-donors"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bonnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154796" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154796" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BloodCell.jpg" alt="Blood cell" class="wp-image-154796 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BloodCell.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BloodCell-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154796" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A blood cell viewed under an electron microscope. (&lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news-and-features/2025-03-11_beneficial-genetic-changes-observed-in-regular-blood-donors"&gt;Hector Huerga Encabo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donating blood may better train these stem cells to replace blood in the right way. Follow-up tests in mice backed up that idea of boosting regenerative capacity, without introducing potentially harmful &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-identified-hundreds-of-genes-that-could-cause-cancer"&gt;genetic mutations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are limitations to consider. Blood donors are more likely to be healthier anyway (it's a condition of giving blood), so figuring out any additional health benefit is tricky, because it might actually come from being in better shape to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our sample size is quite modest, so we can't say that blood donation definitely decreases the incidence of pre-leukemic mutations," &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news-and-features/2025-03-11_beneficial-genetic-changes-observed-in-regular-blood-donors"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bonnet. "We will need to look at these results in much larger numbers of people."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of any health benefits – and previous studies &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/regular-blood-donations-can-reduce-the-levels-of-forever-chemicals-in-the-blood"&gt;have found others&lt;/a&gt; – there's an urgent need for blood donors. In the US, someone needs blood or platelets (small fragments in blood) &lt;a href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/how-blood-donations-help/blood-needs-blood-supply.html"&gt;every two seconds&lt;/a&gt;. Having healthier blood is an added bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while we wait for more detailed studies to confirm these findings, the study tells us more about how blood cancers can get started in the first place – particularly why dangerous mutations do and don't develop in response to stress – which then points to potential therapy options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're now aiming to work out how these different types of mutations play a role in developing leukemia or not, and whether they can be targeted therapeutically," &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news-and-features/2025-03-11_beneficial-genetic-changes-observed-in-regular-blood-donors"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; stem cell biologist Hector Huerga Encabo, from the Francis Crick Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/doi/10.1182/blood.2024027999/535979/Clonal-Hematopoiesis-Landscape-in-Frequent-Blood"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;Ten million people&lt;/a&gt; are diagnosed with dementia worldwide each year – that's more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-us/news-and-media/facts-media"&gt;According to the Alzheimer's Society&lt;/a&gt; approximately one million people in the UK are currently living with the disease. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-91178-7"&gt;Studies predict&lt;/a&gt; this figure will rise to 1.6 million people by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="155248" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease is the &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/alzheimers-disease"&gt;most common cause of dementia&lt;/a&gt; and leads to a decline in memory and thinking skills. This is a &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/alzheimers-disease"&gt;physical illness&lt;/a&gt; that causes the brain to stop working properly and &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers"&gt;gets worse&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying the onset of Alzheimer's early can help patients and caregivers find the right support and medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to detect Alzheimer's early is by spotting &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26484921/"&gt;changes to&lt;/a&gt; people's &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09919"&gt;use of language&lt;/a&gt;. This is because &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24142144/"&gt;new speech problems&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-160507"&gt;one of the first signs&lt;/a&gt; of a mental decline that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16193251/"&gt;could indicate the onset&lt;/a&gt; of this disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are five early, speech-related signs of Alzheimer's disease to look out for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Pauses, hesitations, and vagueness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most recognisable symptoms of Alzheimer's disease is trouble remembering specific words, which can often lead to frequent or long &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-201584"&gt;pauses and hesitations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a person with Alzheimer's is struggling to remember a word, they may talk vaguely such as saying "thing", or describing and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4462568/"&gt;talking around a word&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if someone is having trouble remembering the word dog, they may say something like "people have them as pets … they bark … I used to have one when I was a child".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xXKj3e6ug4w?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Using words with the wrong meaning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trouble remembering the right word can be an early feature of Alzheimer's. People with Alzheimer's might &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-12313-008"&gt;replace a word&lt;/a&gt; they are trying to say with something related to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, instead of saying "dog", they might use an animal from the same category, saying "cat" for instance. In the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, however, these changes are more likely to be related to a broader or more general category such as saying "animal" instead of "cat".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Talking about a task rather than doing it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone with Alzheimer's may struggle with completing tasks. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1460-6984.12444"&gt;Instead of performing a task&lt;/a&gt;, they may talk about their feelings toward the task, express doubts, or mention past abilities. They might say, "I'm not sure I can do this" or "I used to be good at this", rather than &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-201584"&gt;discussing the task&lt;/a&gt; directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145448" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642.jpg" alt="An older woman with grey hair and glasses, talking on the phone" class="size-full wp-image-145448" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642-603x415.jpg 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642-600x413.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145448" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Trouble remembering the right word can be an early feature of Alzheimer's. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MACBY2f2Dks/"&gt;Rido/Canva)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Less word variety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more subtle indicator of Alzheimer's disease is the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24142144/"&gt;tendency to use&lt;/a&gt; simpler language, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-201584"&gt;relying on common words&lt;/a&gt;. People with Alzheimer's often repeat the same verbs, nouns and adjectives &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5137196/"&gt;instead of using a broader vocabulary&lt;/a&gt;. They can also use "the", "and" or "but" frequently to connect sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Difficulty finding the right words&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with Alzheimer's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393204000296"&gt;can have trouble&lt;/a&gt; thinking of words, objects or things that belong in a group. This is sometimes used as a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5929311/"&gt;cognitive test&lt;/a&gt; for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, those with Alzheimer's may struggle to name things in a specific category, such as different foods, different parts of the body or words that start with the same letter. This gets harder as the disease progresses, making these tasks increasingly challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T-BfOEfGWEI?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age is the biggest risk factor for developing Alzheimer's – the chance of developing the disease &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/alzheimers-disease"&gt;doubles every five years&lt;/a&gt; after the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alzheimers-disease/causes/"&gt;one in 20 people&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease are under the age of 65. This is referred to as younger – or early-onset Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While forgetting words now and then is normal, persistent and worsening problems remembering words, speaking fluently, or using a variety of words could be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying these signs early can be particularly important for people at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease as they age, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/alzheimers-disease-people-down-syndrome"&gt;people with Down Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/252251/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Kennedy’s misinformation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before becoming the top health official in America, Kennedy had long railed against vaccines, becoming one of the world's most prominent anti-vaccine advocates and most prolific spreaders of misinformation and disinformation about vaccines. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/robert-f-kennedy-jr-is-the-single-leading-source-of-anti-vax-ads-on-facebook/"&gt;A 2019 study&lt;/a&gt; found Kennedy was the single leading source of anti-vaccine ads on Facebook. Kennedy subsequently faced bans from &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/09/claims-that-vaccines-are-used-to-track-people-will-now-result-in-youtube-bans/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/rfk-jrs-anti-vaccine-group-kicked-instagram-facebook-rcna43830"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/top-anti-vaxxer-robert-f-kennedy-jr-banned-from-instagram-but-not-facebook/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; for spreading misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers directly blame Kennedy and the Trump administration for the attack on vaccine research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Kennedy’s war on vaccines has started," the mRNA vaccine researcher in Philadelphia told KFF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There will not be any research funded by NIH on mRNA vaccines," the scientist in New York similar told the outlet. "MAGA people are convinced that these vaccines have killed and maimed tens of thousands of people. It’s not true, but they believe that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has made various statements against vaccines generally, as well as mRNA vaccines specifically. He falsely claimed the vaccine causes severe harms, including causing neurodegenerative diseases, &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1482157837354737668"&gt;such as Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021, during the height of the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/petition.pdf"&gt;Kennedy petitioned the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; to revoke the authorization of COVID-19 vaccines and refrain from approving any future COVID-19 vaccines. A study in 2022, meanwhile, estimated that the vaccines had &lt;a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations"&gt;saved more than 3 million lives&lt;/a&gt; and prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NIH's recent moves aren't the first sign that Kennedy will use his powerful position to attack mRNA vaccines. Late last month, Bloomberg reported that HHS was considering canceling a &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Announces-Updates-on-Pandemic-Influenza-Program/default.aspx"&gt;$590 million grant to vaccine maker Moderna&lt;/a&gt; to develop &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/trump-team-weighs-pulling-funding-for-moderna-bird-flu-vaccine"&gt;mRNA vaccines against potential pandemic influenza&lt;/a&gt; viruses. That includes the H5N1 virus that is currently devastating US poultry and spreading wildly in dairy cows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An HHS spokesperson told media at the time that "While it is crucial that the US Department and Health and Human Services support pandemic preparedness, four years of the Biden administration’s failed oversight have made it necessary to review agreements for vaccine production."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear what is happening with that grant review. Moderna declined to comment when Ars reached out for any potential updates Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="0" class="story_para_0"&gt;Social media is a place where trends constantly emerge and influencers play a major role in prompting them. But blindly following these trends can lead to dangerous consequences as seen in the case of a US-based influencer. Eve Catherine, a Dallas-based influencer, ended up in the hospital after consuming excessive protein while following the viral “carnivore diet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1" class="story_para_1"&gt;The diet, which has gained popularity in recent years, focuses on eating only animal-based foods such as beef, poultry, pork, fish and other animal byproducts. Many influencers, including podcast host Joe Rogan, have praised it. But health experts have warned that this extreme way of eating can lead to serious health issues, New York Post reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="2" class="story_para_2"&gt;Eve Catherine shared her experience on TikTok where she disclosed her diet that comprises eating two or three eggs for breakfast, high-protein yogurt for lunch and a New York strip steak for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="3" class="story_para_3"&gt;During a routine check-up, her doctor noticed high protein levels in her urine but she didn’t take it seriously at the time. Then, one day, she woke up to find she was urinating blood. She was rushed to the emergency room, put on morphine and diagnosed with a kidney stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4" class="story_para_4"&gt;“I literally woke up one day and I was peeing straight blood," she recalled in her video. She also admitted that she had been “addicted to protein" before the health scare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5" class="story_para_5"&gt;After her hospitalisation, she called the carnivore diet “stupid" and urged her followers to be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="6" class="story_para_6"&gt;“Don’t eat too much protein, OK? Don’t neglect your fiber intake," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7" class="story_para_7"&gt;Medical experts have long warned about the risks of consuming too much protein especially for those with underlying kidney issues. The Mayo Clinic states that high-protein diets can strain the kidneys, making it harder for the body to filter out waste. Moreover, these diets often lack fiber which can lead to digestive problems like constipation, headaches and bad breath. Eating excessive amounts of red meat and processed meats can also increase the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="8" class="story_para_8"&gt;Despite these warnings, many social media users dismissed Catherine’s experience in the comments. But there were others who thanked her for speaking out and raising awareness about the dangers of extreme diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="9" class="story_para_9"&gt;Catherine isn’t the only one to face serious health issues from following the carnivore diet. A man from Florida, in his mid-40s, also experienced severe side effects after sticking to the meat- and dairy-heavy diet for around eight months. He ended up in the hospital with yellowish, ooze-producing nodules on his palms, elbows and soles of his feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="jsx-7ca078c3173863e4 jsx-2823269365 atbtlink Location"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Location :&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="rs"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Delhi, India, India&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="jsx-7ca078c3173863e4 jsx-2823269365 brdcrmb"&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="/viral/"&gt;viral&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class="brdout"&gt; US Influencer Follows Viral Carnivore Diet, Lands In Hospital With Kidney Stone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="jsx-7ca078c3173863e4 jsx-2823269365 nxtartseprator"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News18</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 21:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>This Superfood You’ve Never Heard of Could Change the Way We Eat - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQbFpwOWlyYldsenotNk0wM19zblBRY1I2ZDV4Tjh6OEdNMHJUSkppdUF6UlgwSVhYYndPalk2bmFwZldxMFljX2xPM2lna2gya08yVXdnTGU4SVhCcl9wSGI5Sk9WSC1GM0tCZi02QTJYNXhBVnpkdTEwSm92S1BRU1N3UEhDXzBKZTN1bGlrTDBMcjQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 21:26:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQbFpwOWlyYldsenotNk0wM19zblBRY1I2ZDV4Tjh6OEdNMHJUSkppdUF6UlgwSVhYYndPalk2bmFwZldxMFljX2xPM2lna2gya08yVXdnTGU4SVhCcl9wSGI5Sk9WSC1GM0tCZi02QTJYNXhBVnpkdTEwSm92S1BRU1N3UEhDXzBKZTN1bGlrTDBMcjQ</guid></item><item><title>Mississippi reports first outbreak of highly pathogenic bird flu strain in US since 2017 - The Hill</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__text | body-copy | flow"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mississippi state and federal officials have confirmed an outbreak of a strain of bird flu not reported in the U.S. since 2017, with quarantine and depopulation efforts already underway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a statement released March 12, the Mississippi Board of Animal Health stated that poultry from a commercial broiler breeder chicken flock in Noxubee County had tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“The State Veterinarian has quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the property have been depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock have not entered the food system,” the board stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greg Flynn, spokesperson for the Mississippi State Department of Health, confirmed to The Hill that his department was aware of the outbreak and that no human cases have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) under the Department of Agriculture confirmed the outbreak was linked to the H7N9 strain, marking the first outbreak of this strain occurring in commercial poultry in the U.S. since 2017. The APHIS noted this outbreak is unrelated to the H5N1 bird flu outbreaks currently impacting commercial flocks in other parts of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The flock of roughly 46,000 birds was experiencing high mortality, and samples tested at the Mississippi Veterinary Research &amp;amp; Diagnostic Laboratory, a member of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, were presumptive positive for HPAI then confirmed at APHIS’ National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL),” the agency stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Both the Mississippi Board of Animal Health and the APHIS said the risk to the public remains low as the virus is not a food safety risk when eggs and poultry are properly handled and cooked. The Mississippi board called on home poultry owners to practice “good biosecurity” and to be aware of signs of bird flu symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early-life adversity affects more than half of the world's children and is a significant risk factor for cognitive and mental health problems later in life. In an extensive and up-to-the-minute review of research in this domain, scholars from the University of California, Irvine illuminate the profound impacts of these adverse childhood experiences on brain development and introduce new paths for understanding and tackling them.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Their study, &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0896627325001345" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Neuron&lt;/i&gt;, examines the mechanisms behind the long-term consequences of childhood &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adversity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adversity&lt;/a&gt;). Despite extensive research spanning over seven decades, the authors point out that significant questions remain unanswered. For example, how do adults—from parents to researchers—fully comprehend what is perceived as stressful by an infant or child?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such conceptual queries, as well as the use of cutting-edge research tools, can provide a road map, guiding experts toward developing innovative methods and providing solutions to this pressing mental health issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our research suggests that the unpredictability of a child's early environment may be just as important as more traditionally recognized forms of adversity, such as abuse or neglect," said lead author Dr. Tallie Z. Baram, Donald Bren Professor of Pediatrics. "Our review has important implications for how we approach &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/early+intervention/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;early intervention&lt;/a&gt; and prevention strategies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She and co-author Matthew Birnie, a UC Irvine postdoctoral scholar, identify several key areas for further investigation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the developing brain perceive as stressful?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which aspects of stress most significantly influence brain maturation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which developmental ages are most vulnerable to adversity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the molecular mediators of stress effects on the brain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can transient stressful experiences lead to enduring dysfunction?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;One notable discovery is a novel form of early-life stress: unpredictable sensory inputs from caregivers and the environment. This factor plays a substantial role in adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, even after controlling for well-known adverse childhood experiences, which are collectively referred to as ACEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review highlights the limitations of current ACE scoring systems in accurately predicting individual outcomes and underscores the complexity of early-life stress. Emerging factors, such as societal and anthropogenic characteristics like inequality and pollution, are gaining recognition as potential contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal models have been instrumental in unraveling the mechanisms underlying brain development effects. Research has revealed that different types of stress can yield distinct outcomes, influenced by the nature and timing of stress, as well as species, strain and sex variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/molecular+level/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular level&lt;/a&gt;, early-life stress can substantially alter neuronal gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. These changes may lead to long-term modifications in how the brain responds to subsequent experiences. At the circuit level, early stress can disrupt the maturation of brain networks by interfering with crucial developmental processes, including neuronal oscillations and synaptic pruning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're gradually comprehending how early-life stress can 'reprogram' the brain at multiple levels, from individual molecules to entire neural circuits. This knowledge presents new avenues for targeted interventions," Baram said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;The review also identifies key molecular mediators of early-life stress effects, including glucocorticoids and neuropeptides like corticotropin-releasing hormones. Ongoing research is uncovering novel roles for these molecules in specific neural circuits affected by early stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of these findings, the researchers propose redefining early-life stress as "early-life adversity" to better encompass the diverse experiences that can impact &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+development/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain development&lt;/a&gt;, even those not traditionally perceived as stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This review emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive understanding of early-life adversity," Baram said. "By focusing on how the developing brain processes and responds to these experiences, we can develop more effective strategies to prevent and mitigate their long-term effects."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest increased funding for and attention to this critical area of study, highlighting its potential to enhance mental health outcomes and reduce the societal burden of early-life adversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those driving by the hospital the past two weeks may have noted the signs lit up in yellow to honor Endometriosis Awareness Month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.uconn.edu/women/gynecology/endometriosis/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJFKOZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHckqVIepPRx4nOvL6kGe9pbhcEv3kO-W22dL3JFbal_Dm-LDEp-eD4jnoQ_aem_XuJ6EEiXjfK7NU9_HZDcKA"&gt;Endometriosis&lt;/a&gt; is a systemic disease, causing chronic pain, severe menstrual cramps, and other symptoms ranging from gastro-intestinal problems to anxiety and depression, which can result from experiencing a chronic medical issue. This complicated disease affects 1 in 10 women with many experiencing a diagnostic delay of 7-10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ctendorise.org/"&gt;EndoRISE&lt;/a&gt;, a state-supported initiative led by researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.jax.org/personalized-medicine/endometriosis-research-at-jax"&gt;The Jackson Laboratory (JAX)&lt;/a&gt; and healthcare providers at &lt;a href="https://health.uconn.edu/"&gt;UConn Health&lt;/a&gt;, aims to improve outcomes for those with this debilitating condition. And the first steps are awareness and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Danielle Luciano interim chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at UConn Health launched EndoRISE with Elise Courtois, Ph.D., the director of the single-cell biology lab at JAX, where the CT Data and Biorepository is located. Together, with Jasmina Kuljancic, program manager for EndoRISE they work with State of Connecticut legislators to promote endometriosis research, education, and awareness, and to advocate for increased funding to combat this systemic disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this initiative, a team of doctors and researchers, including Luciano, Dr. Alexis Newmark, Kuljancic, and Kayceety Mullaj EndoRISE research coordinator, have begun engaging with the community to educate school nurses. These nurses play a vital role in identifying and supporting students who may be experiencing endometriosis. They are also encouraged to conduct in-service training sessions for school staff, particularly athletic trainers, on key topics covered in the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When speaking to a group in Meriden last fall, Luciano asked those in the room “who knows what endometriosis is?” Only a few hands were raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of training is especially important for students like Jerica Leary, a 17-year-old from East Hampton who began experiencing painful symptoms six years ago. Her condition caused her to miss school and extracurricular activities, ultimately leading her to lose her spot on the cheerleading team due to frequent absences from school and practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School nurses and staff often misunderstand the disease, dismissing students’ pain as mere menstrual cramps and underestimating its severity. In Jerica’s case, she was frequently given ibuprofen and ice and sent back to class, despite the intensity of her symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Treating endometriosis is a team sport and takes a multidisciplinary approach,” said Luciano. “School nurses can play a crucial role in recognizing symptoms early, potentially transforming the lives of students who might otherwise suffer in silence. If endometriosis patients miss school due to period pain, just think of the opportunities they may miss down the line, from college acceptances to internships and more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows that teens with endometriosis are 10 times more likely to miss school than healthy teens. This results in academic difficulties, social isolation, anxiety and depression and low self-esteem. People with endometriosis often face a lack of understanding from those around them. It is also very common for them to have their symptoms dismissed by friends, family, and healthcare providers. They may be told that the severe pain they are experiencing is normal or that they are just being dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jerica began with seeing an OB/GYN and was told that her symptoms were normal, and she should go on birth control to alleviate the symptoms. She was determined to find the cause of her pain rather than simply masking it with birth control. Her pain was so severe that it often caused her to vomit or became so intense and sharp that she couldn’t move or walk. Searching for answers, she consulted a gastroenterologist, but tests revealed that her gastrointestinal tract was healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She decided to find a new gynecologist and came to UConn Health where she was seen by OBGYN APRN Christine Biolo who referred her to Luciano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dr. Luciano asked my family history and knew right away to look for endometriosis,” says Jerica whose mother and grandmother both had the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last August, Dr. Luciano performed a laparoscopy to accurately diagnose Jerica’s endometriosis and successfully removed the affected tissue. Since then, she has been pain-free. While she understands that the condition may return, she is exploring preventive options, including birth control. With a clear diagnosis and relief from her symptoms, Jerica can now focus on enjoying her senior year of high school and preparing for her future studies in political science at the University of Tampa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the feedback the from the events held with school nurses in Meriden, Stamford and the Connecticut Association of Nurses, the education is making a difference.  At a recent training the survey results found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfort level with recognizing endometriosis went from 13% comfortable pre lecture to 40% comfortable and 20% very comfortable after the lecture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior to the lecture, 53% felt they did NOT have the appropriate resources to help their students, which dropped down to 20% post lecture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80% were likely to change their practice after the presentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These trainings are a powerful reminder of the importance of education and collaboration in tackling this often-misunderstood disease. By empowering school nurses with knowledge and resources, EndoRISE is actively working for better diagnosis, treatment and ultimately, better lives for those affected by endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;

In ways big and small, Bay Area residents are still coping with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Monthly total deaths have settled, but still higher than pre-pandemic normal&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early shutdown in the Bay Area and California is often credited with the region’s lower-than-average COVID death rates. Still, over the last five years, the death certificates of more than 110,000 California residents list COVID as the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortality patterns have not quite returned to normal. California’s death totals from all causes have remained above the 2016-2019 average each month since 2020, sometimes much higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before 2020, influenza was the only infectious disease that caused notable fluctuations in death totals. But starting in early 2020, COVID changed the baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deadliest month in the years before the pandemic was January 2018, during a bad flu season, when 28,400 people died in the state. But a jaw-dropping 48,000 died in January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID deaths alone do not account for the entire increase, though it does explain a large portion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The health care system has been profoundly perturbed by the pandemic,” said John Swartzberg, clinical professor emeritus at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COVID caused a lot of premature deaths from heart attacks,” Swartzberg said. “Also the disruption had effects on the populace that were deleterious to its health: increased alcohol consumption, decreased activity, depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Unemployment rate returned to pre-pandemic levels after two years&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of unemployed California residents remained steady, around 4%, in the two years leading up to the pandemic, but jumped to over 16% by April 2020, when pandemic shutdowns and disruptions caused so many people to lose their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a little more than two years, but by the summer of 2022 unemployment rates were back around 4%. Since then, the rate has been steadily increasing, reaching 5.5% in December 2024, up from the post-pandemic low of 3.8% in August 2022, though unemployment rates don’t tell the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Rise of working from home has profoundly changed transportation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ridership on BART plummeted when the shelter-in-place orders were issued, from an average weekday ridership of around 400,000 in 2019 to just 25,000 in April 2020. But while many people have returned to their offices, BART ridership was about 163,000 in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“BART ridership has hovered around 40% of pre-pandemic volume” said Abby Raisz, research director at the Bay Area Council Economic Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of people crossing the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge dropped by about half in April 2020 but mostly recovered after the first 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generally speaking, since late 2020, like the Bay Bridge traffic volumes have been … around 90% of what they were pre-pandemic,” Raisz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;California students are still trying to catch up&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the pandemic shutdown started, students were sent home and spent months in virtual classrooms, where many struggled to keep up. And the proof is in the test scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percent of California students who met or exceeded standards for English language and mathematics testing had been on a slightly positive trajectory in the years leading up to the 2018-19 school year, with just over 51% of students meeting language expectations that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now just 47% of students meet those standards for language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Math aptitude has always trended lower but was also on a positive trajectory through the 2018-19 school year when about 40% of students met or exceeded the standard. Now, 35.5% of students in the Golden State met the standard for math last year, still well shy of pre-pandemic levels despite slight gains in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;California’s population is growing again after two years of big exodus drops&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID impacted California’s population profoundly — hundreds of thousands moved out of the state in the first two years of the pandemic, a trend referred to as the exodus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The causes for the California exodus, which was even more pronounced in the Bay Area, has been hotly debated. Many point to the extra-strict pandemic regulations imposed by public health officials locally and statewide, and the high and rapidly increasing cost of living is often cited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest updates show that California is back to year-over-year population growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Bay Area, “foreign immigration is back to a level that we hadn’t really seen since around 2019,” Raisz said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent most of my twenties locked in an all-out war with my skin, and I lost every battle. You name an &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-acne-skincare-products-review/"&gt;acne treatment&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ve &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-beef-tallow-skincare-products-review/"&gt;slathered&lt;/a&gt; it on my face with reckless optimism and abandon. Retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid — I layered them like a chemist, convinced I was one product away from finally having the poreless, glowing skin everyone around me seemed to have. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, I got perioral dermatitis: a cruel, red, flaky rash around my mouth that pleaded, &lt;em&gt;Quit attacking your face&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;you dip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After many frantic Google searches and an emergency dermatologist visit (where I was gently but explicitly told to “calm down”), I realized my skin barrier was holding on by a thread, and my hormonal acne wasn’t going to be bullied into submission with another round of spot treatments. I needed a different approach — one that didn’t involve me staring into the mirror every morning, whispering, &lt;em&gt;What fresh hell is this?&lt;/em&gt; That’s when I stumbled across &lt;a data-nyp-link-source="trackonomics" data-nyp-affiliate="true" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/nypost_01638_nypost?p=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2Fshopping%2Fclearstem-supplement-skincare-review%2F&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fclearstem-skincare.sjv.io%2Fc%2F2229206%2F1126133%2F14265%3FsubId1%3Dnyp-RW-TXL-clearstemreview%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fclearstem.com%2Fproducts%2Fmindbodyskin-hormonal-acne-supplement-no-5-htp&amp;amp;author=Kendall%20Cornish&amp;amp;articleID=35304913&amp;amp;event_type=click&amp;amp;publishdate=march%2017%2C%202025&amp;amp;linksource=web&amp;amp;primarytag=skincare&amp;amp;contentsection=shopping" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;CLEARSTEM MINDBODYSKIN&lt;/a&gt;, a supplement designed to tackle hormonal acne from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My review&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;em&gt; Jump scare warning!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was skeptical. I’ve taken enough “acne-fighting” supplements in my day to know that most of them just give you expensive pee. But the CLEARSTEM reviews were great, the founder story felt genuinely skin-nerd passionate, and there weren’t any toxic fillers or mystery ingredients in sight. Plus, my skin was already at rock bottom, so I figured since it’s not a topical chemical, what did I have to lose&lt;em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; Here’s how it went.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started taking &lt;a href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2FB8E79071-99A6-42FF-A569-A263902CE172%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2Fshopping%2Fclearstem-supplement-skincare-review%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;MINDBODYSKIN&lt;/a&gt; with the cautious optimism of a woman who has quite literally been burned before. My hormonal acne tends to flare up around my jawline, and after years of wrecking my skin barrier with topical, over-the-counter treatments, I needed something that would get to the root of the issue without sending me into another perioral dermatitis flare-up.&lt;/p&gt;

skin 4 weeks ago. Go easy on me. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;New York Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within two weeks, my skin was noticeably calmer. No new cystic breakouts, no dramatic flare-ups, just steady skin. By week four, I had an almost shocking realization one day when I was applying my makeup: my skin was actually clear. Like, no, “this side of my face is fine, but don’t look at my jawline,” clear. Just…&lt;em&gt;clear&lt;/em&gt;-clear. I have never in my life found a product that actually cleared my skin in under a month. It has been four weeks of testing this product, having purchased it myself and fully expecting it to be another &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt; addition to my routine. Instead, it did what years of prescriptions, topicals, birth control, and dietary changes failed to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference? My usual PMS breakout never showed up. Normally, either side of my chin would be a disaster zone the week before my period, but this time? Nothing. My skin wasn’t just behaving…it was thriving. The redness from old breakouts faded, and my skin looked smoother and less inflamed overall. The best part? No new or continued perioral dermatitis flare-ups. This is huge for me because so many acne treatments send my skin straight into a full-blown bumpy, red rash. But with MINDBODYSKIN, my skin got clearer without any reactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when I say no reactions, I mean no reactions. It’s a supplement, so with my luck, I half expected that even if it were to clear my skin it would probably also wreck my stomach, mind, weight…something. Nope. I physically feel better: more energy, more optimism, more clarity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are two types of MINDBODYSKIN: one with 5-HTP (a dietary supplement that raises serotonin levels in the brain) and one without it. I opted for the one without it since I’m already taking an SSRI, and I still got noticeably great mood affects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The verdict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call it a side-effect of clear skin, but I frankly don’t care what it is. I love this stuff and, better still, it loves me. Would I repurchase? Absolutely. In fact, I’m committing to taking it for another two months to reinforce the effects and make sure this isn’t some kind of skincare placebo dream.

&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually cleared my skin in under a month (first product to ever do this)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;br&gt;Balances hormones naturally&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contains anti-inflammatory and stress-reducing ingredients&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Supports gut health (a.k.a. fewer surprise breakouts from “mystery foods”)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;No sketchy fillers, artificial dyes, or hormone disruptors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doesn’t dry out or irritate skin like topical treatments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takes time to see results (not an overnight miracle)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Can cause an initial “purge” phase&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Pricey ($58.00 per bottle)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Requires consistency — no skipping doses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MINDBODYSKIN is an anti-acne supplement designed to support hormonal balance, gut health, and skin clarity, all without the harsh side effects of prescription medications. It contains key ingredients like DIM (Diindolylmethane), vitamin B5, turmeric, and ashwagandha, all chosen for their ability to reduce excess androgens, calm inflammation, and support the body’s natural detoxification process. Unlike traditional acne treatments, which attack the skin from the outside, this one takes an inside-out approach, focusing on balancing the hormones and deficiencies that often trigger breakouts.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;FAQs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is CLEARSTEM MINDBODYSKIN?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CLEARSTEM MINDBODYSKIN is an anti-acne, hormone-balancing supplement designed to target breakouts from the inside out. Instead of harsh topical treatments that dry out the skin or prescription medications with heavy side effects, this supplement works by regulating hormones, reducing inflammation, and supporting gut health — three major causes of persistent acne.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It contains a blend of science-backed, natural ingredients that help clear skin, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIM (Diindolylmethane)&lt;/strong&gt; – Regulates estrogen and testosterone levels to prevent hormonal breakouts&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)&lt;/strong&gt; – Reduces excess oil production&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turmeric &amp;amp; ALA (Alpha Lipoic Acid)&lt;/strong&gt; – Anti-inflammatory powerhouses that calm redness and irritation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashwagandha&lt;/strong&gt; – Lowers cortisol levels (stress = breakouts)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bioavailable Zinc &amp;amp; Selenium&lt;/strong&gt; – Supports skin healing and immune function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MINDBODYSKIN is gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, and non-toxic, making it a clean, holistic alternative to traditional acne treatments. It’s designed for people dealing with hormonal acne, adult acne, or inflammation-related breakouts, especially those who want a long-term, sustainable solution without harsh side effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is CLEARSTEM for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

It’s particularly great for those who:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have cyclical, hormonal breakouts (especially around the jawline or chin)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Have tried topical treatments without success&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Struggle with gut health issues that contribute to skin problems&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Want a non-toxic, hormone-balancing approach to acne&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long does it take CLEARSTEM to work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most users start seeing initial improvements within 2-4 weeks, with skin looking calmer and breakouts reducing in frequency. Full results typically take 8-12 weeks, as the body adjusts to the hormonal balancing and anti-inflammatory effects. Some people may experience an initial purge phase in the first few weeks as toxins and excess hormones are flushed out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need a prescription for CLEARSTEM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, CLEARSTEM MINDBODYSKIN does not require a prescription. It’s an over-the-counter supplement made with all-natural, science-backed ingredients that support hormonal and skin health. However, if you’re on prescription medications for acne or hormonal conditions, it’s always a good idea to check with your doctor before starting a new supplement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much does CLEARSTEM cost?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

While it’s on the pricier side for supplements, it replaces the need for multiple skincare products and can help prevent costly dermatologist visits or prescription treatments. CLEARSTEM also offers bundle discounts and subscription options to save money on repeat purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The body you inhabit is made up of lots of moving parts that need to communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of this communication – in the nervous system, for example – takes the form of bioelectrical signals that propagate through the body to trigger the appropriate response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, US researchers have discovered that the epithelial cells that line our skin and organs are able to signal the same way to communicate peril. They just use a long, slow 'scream', rather than the rapid-fire communication of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a huge surprise, since these cells had been previously considered 'mute' – and may open new avenues for electrical medical devices to accelerate healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Epithelial cells do things that no one has ever thought to look for," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076752"&gt;says polymath Steve Granick&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. "When injured, they 'scream' to their neighbors, slowly, persistently, and over surprising distances. It's like a nerve's impulse, but 1,000 times slower."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155087" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155087" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/keratinocytes.jpg" alt="For The First Time, We've Heard The Slow, Silent Scream of Human Skin" class="size-full wp-image-155087" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/keratinocytes.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/keratinocytes-440x415.jpg 440w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/keratinocytes-600x566.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155087" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The team's research involved using a laser to wound (white dots) a single layer of skin cells, using electrodes (black circles) to detect the signals. (Steve Granick)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-observe-cells-in-the-body-working-like-computer-circuit-boards"&gt;body's communication networks&lt;/a&gt; keep it functioning. You'll whip your hand off a hot surface &lt;em&gt;tout de suite&lt;/em&gt; without even thinking about it; that's your nervous system at work. Your heart's pumping action is &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21648-heart-conduction-system"&gt;regulated via electrical signals&lt;/a&gt;; the discovery of this enabled the invention of the artificial pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granick and his colleague, biomedical engineer Sun-Min Yu of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, designed a system to investigate cellular communication in the epithelium. Their system consisted of a chip connected to an array of around 60 electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chip was coated with a single layer of lab-grown human keratinocytes, the main epithelial cells that make up the epidermis, the outer layer of skin. With a laser, the researchers "stung" the skin layer, using the electrode array to listen in to the electrical shifts that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We tracked how cells coordinated their response," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076752"&gt;Yu says&lt;/a&gt;. "It's a slow-motion, excited conversation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting signals propagated at speeds of around 10 millimeters per second, across quite large distances up to hundreds of micrometers from the site of the wound. It seems not dissimilar to the electrical calcium signaling observed in plants when &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/plant-damage-response-defence-calcium-ions-glutamate-fluorescent"&gt;damaged by a hungry, hungry caterpillar&lt;/a&gt;, as seen in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lzq-wRHCTKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This &lt;/span&gt;communication, the researchers observed, relied heavily on ion channels, small pores in cell membranes that allow the transport of charged ions, predominantly calcium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, these &lt;span&gt;epithelial-cell&lt;/span&gt; ion channels respond to a mechanical stimulus, such as pressure or stretching, which is slightly different from the ion channels of neurons, which respond to changes in voltage or chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The epithelial signals last much longer than neuronal signals, too, with some "conversations" recorded for up to five hours, according to the researchers. However, the voltage was of a similar amplitude to that observed in neurons, and the communication cycled through the phases that neuronal communication does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this is only a newly discovered phenomenon, more work needs to be conducted to understand how it works, and the different contributing factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't know for sure what the cells are using for the signal, or if different &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22062-epithelium"&gt;kinds of epithelial cells&lt;/a&gt; are operating differently when it comes to communicating harm, though initial tests suggest calcium ions are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the discovery&lt;/span&gt; hints at new possibilities for biomedical devices, like wearable sensors and electronic bandages that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-use-electricity-to-make-wounds-heal-3x-faster"&gt;accelerate wound healing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Understanding these screams between wounded cells opens doors we didn't know existed," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076752"&gt;Yu says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2427123122"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Among adults, procedures such as filling cavities tend to peak in your early to mid-50s, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/-/media/project/ada-organization/ada/ada-org/files/resources/research/hpi/hpibrief_restorative_care_demand_patient_age.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Health Policy Institute&lt;/a&gt;. By the time you reach your 60s, you’re almost certain to need treatment for tooth decay. Figuring out exactly what dental care you need and when can be challenging. Yet there’s one key step that’s  simple and inexpensive: taking care of your teeth at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PIA6AEDE3BAUNAW6H3OOGU2UHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Though certain dental problems may require extra attention, the basics of brushing twice daily and cleaning between your teeth by flossing haven’t changed. And while plenty of companies would like to sell you pricey gadgets and special products for your oral health, you don’t need to shell out big bucks to keep your mouth in great shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="MN6M5UU4H5BEBNHF3AKFCIZMWI" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="MN6M5UU4H5BEBNHF3AKFCIZMWI"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How often for dental cleaning?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GJODEAKLUFFDHFCBF4GTBRTBLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Even with great home hygiene habits, you still need to see your dentist regularly for checkups and cleanings. Some people will need to visit more often than the standard twice a year, while others may be fine with less frequent visits. A &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004346.pub5/full" target="_blank"&gt;2020 review by Cochrane&lt;/a&gt;, an independent group of expert researchers, found that adults who visited the dentist every six months and those who visited on a schedule customized to their individual dental risk had comparable oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YT4YLNYPLVGWNAJIHGLJTK6QLA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People who are being treated for periodontal disease or who have dental implants — which can fail more quickly than a natural tooth — may need to see their provider every three months or so, says Martha McComas, a clinical associate professor of dentistry at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry in Ann Arbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N7LCDILVEFHBFD4JRCRH6IHLHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Your dentist can help you figure out the right cadence for checkups, as well as your optimal at-home dental care strategy. “We can customize it based on what we see in your mouth,” says Karin Arsenault, program director of geriatric dentistry at the Tufts University School of Dental Medicine in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4MUHYP2L4JEMTCZCMUW4EZODUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Between visits, here’s what you need to know about the vital tools for keeping your teeth and your whole mouth as healthy as they can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="MVTVEIWAPBBKTKB34DYVZMA7H4" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="MVTVEIWAPBBKTKB34DYVZMA7H4"&gt;Your toothpaste matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HRI4FF7XEBB4TN765ZATBSOIUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Fluoride is important. Fluoride is crucial because of the power it has to help fight cavities and tooth decay — something proved by decades of research. While some ingredients, notably a chemical called hydroxyapatite, have shown promise as viable alternatives, fluoride is still your best choice right now, according to the American Dental Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TAOXEKFBAFBEXKLRQMHSXQPSZE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cavities occur when the bacteria in our mouths consume the traces of food left on our teeth, particularly anything sugary. As the bacteria gobble up these sugars, they release acid, which can remove minerals from our teeth’s enamel, eventually creating cavities. Fluoride can help replace some of these lost minerals, strengthening the surface of our teeth and repairing some damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RMXMCQKKKVEBHAOIGTX5UORUZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When you’re shopping for toothpaste, look for one with the ADA Seal of Acceptance. To earn that seal, manufacturers need to not only include fluoride in their toothpaste but also meet other safety and efficacy standards, including one meant to ensure toothpastes aren’t too abrasive. (Very abrasive toothpastes can damage enamel.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MD3AYWC2SFG2JMCQWPC2I6BKSA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Watch out for this ingredient: If you’re prone to canker sores inside your mouth, you may want to look for a toothpaste that doesn’t contain sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jop.12845" target="_blank"&gt;2019 research review&lt;/a&gt; found that using an SLS-free toothpaste might help reduce canker sores in people who get a lot of them (about 25 percent of adults).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IDGT3CM3KJGSFO4YISQVRITNBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Skip charcoal toothpaste. Activated charcoal is often touted as a superior ingredient for a variety of products, including toothpaste. But it can be highly abrasive, which research has shown &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/dental-oral-care/does-charcoal-toothpaste-work-a7477277301/" target="_blank"&gt;can damage your enamel and cause increased sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VYUJCP3VONGNJHA4WYVHWG3LCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How much toothpaste to use: Generally, adults need only a pea-size amount of toothpaste — that will create enough foam to cover all the surfaces in your mouth, Arsenault says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FJKIZZFJ5VCAJHJGUFOYLC6Q6M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Also, “one of the big myths about toothbrushing is that you should rinse your mouth out after you brush,” says McComas. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8896328/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies show that the fluoride in your toothpaste provides the biggest benefit if you don’t do this&lt;/a&gt;, instead allowing the fluoride to work its magic on your enamel for more time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EGKF7XID4FCRHGOIADURTCRZ64" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What about prescription pastes? You may want to ask your dentist whether a prescription toothpaste, which generally contains a higher dose of fluoride, might be right for you. Severe dry mouth, which can be more common as you age (particularly if you’re taking certain medications for various chronic conditions, including for high blood pressure and depression), can raise your risk of cavities. So can periodontal disease, especially if the surfaces of the roots of your teeth, which lack protective enamel, are exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="HCDUXKCQQNBADLSO53HEZLF3MQ" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="HCDUXKCQQNBADLSO53HEZLF3MQ"&gt;How to brush well&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HVJ7ZTQXQNAGNDWM3VXLZUDWSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The right bristles: Use a toothbrush with soft or extra-soft bristles. There are so many toothbrush options, but in the midst of considering the shape of the brush head, the brand name and other fancy features, don’t lose sight of bristle stiffness. Seek out a toothbrush with “soft” or “extra soft” on the packaging. Stiffer bristles are more likely to damage your gums or your teeth’s enamel, according to the American Dental Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IT4MZEUCZZBBJI54XKOUSU5SOY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The advantages of an electric toothbrush: You can keep your mouth perfectly healthy with a manual toothbrush, but a &lt;a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD002281/ORAL_poweredelectric-toothbrushes-compared-to-manual-toothbrushes-for-maintaining-oral-health" target="_blank"&gt;2014 Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt; found that three months of using an electric toothbrush resulted in 21 percent less plaque and 11 percent less gum inflammation (also called gingivitis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZTW7JNRRHNBTLOGUCKWBPPCRYI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/toothbrushes/is-a-sonic-or-a-rotating-electric-toothbrush-better-a1107158095/" target="_blank"&gt;not significant performance differences&lt;/a&gt; between oscillating (or rotating) electric toothbrushes, which typically have round heads, and sonic toothbrushes, which usually have rectangular heads. So get the kind you like and will use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ON3LQI4HCNCE7GRNGQIXVPDHKY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How much to brush: Do it twice a day for at least two minutes. Some research suggests that people may brush for a lot less time than this on average, possibly around a minute or less. But common sense and a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19723429/" target="_blank"&gt;2009 Journal of Dental Hygiene study&lt;/a&gt; suggest that brushing longer will remove more plaque — though the added benefit of extra time beyond two minutes is probably marginal, and brushing too hard can exacerbate problems, including receding gums, which can expose the roots of your teeth to a greater risk of cavities and tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="BDAE2VS4PNFJDDQ5TP2I4JT5GY" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="BDAE2VS4PNFJDDQ5TP2I4JT5GY"&gt;How to floss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FFIKPGFC7ZDETAMZOPE6XW7O3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Why flossing matters: Use any standard string floss (waxed or unwaxed), floss pick or interdental cleaning brush. The scientific evidence for flossing is not as strong as it is for brushing: A 2019 Cochrane review found that flossing in addition to brushing may reduce plaque and gingivitis more than brushing alone, but the authors cautioned that the evidence supporting this conclusion was weak. Still, dentists say the biological justification for flossing is sound: Without it, the bacteria that cause decay can build up between your teeth even if you’re brushing regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7EEIITIXH5EHZI4X5SIB5KRD24" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Do water flossers work? While not quite as effective as string floss, water flossers can be a great option if you have a hard time using string floss, have mouth hardware like braces or a permanent retainer, or have other kinds of dental work like implants, bridges, or crowns. Dentist Sally Cram, a spokeswoman  for the American Dental Association, says the evidence on the benefits of a water flosser is encouraging, but it’s not enough for her to recommend it as a replacement for flossing just yet. Still, if you know you won’t use string floss every day, a water flosser is better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VMAVHRF44ZFBBD47KAAVWB4UYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Avoid floss with PFAS. Skip floss that’s coated with these environmental contaminants, which are associated with a variety of health problems. You can look for flosses that use non-PFAS coatings such as beeswax or plant waxes like carnauba or candelilla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U6YB4NTPYBEY7FAM2OGL3EOPA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;CR partnered with Made Safe, an independent organization that certifies products as safer and more sustainable, to find flosses made without PFAS.

If you have an implant, you may want to opt for an interdental brush instead of regular string floss, particularly if your implant doesn’t touch the teeth next to it on either side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H2IOVMRTANEKRLXCRTLHT6CYAE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These are tiny round brushes designed specifically to clean in between teeth, and they work well with teeth that have gaps in between them. They come in different sizes, so Jennifer Harmon, a registered dental hygienist and clinical associate professor at the University of North Carolina Adams School of Dentistry in Chapel Hill, recommends working with your dentist to figure out which size you need for your teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M4IKIW6HLNC5BFSD2I7HUPO56I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re dealing with bleeding gums, Arsenault says, you can consider using prescription chlorhexidine mouthwash after you floss. Just be sure to follow your dentist’s instructions, because chlorhexidine can also cause some tooth staining and changes in taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="ATEL5BV7MVEF5FJDESNMOQKRXI" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="ATEL5BV7MVEF5FJDESNMOQKRXI"&gt;Do you need these dental tools?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JWTXB4XSTRGXFJOUNPRA5VRVPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tongue scrapers:&lt;/b&gt; The experts we spoke with say this is a great tool. The bacteria that cause tooth decay don’t just live on your teeth; they can collect on your tongue, too. That means you should clean your tongue daily. You can do this with your toothbrush bristles or the ridged back of some brushes, but a tongue scraper can be a little more effective,  Cram says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BUEAUKTJG5AN7CMYRFBKFWEGN4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Plus, scraping your tongue is a great habit if you struggle with halitosis (bad breath), says Roxanne Dsouza-Norwood, a registered dental hygienist and clinical assistant professor of dental hygiene at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. But be gentle; otherwise you could accidentally lacerate your tongue. And you may need to experiment with different types of tongue scrapers to find one that doesn’t activate your gag reflex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7YITL4TDOVE6TPTYGODOTRW3CI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whitening strips:&lt;/b&gt; Over-the-counter whitening strips can help your teeth look whiter, but it can sometimes be difficult to spot the change,  McComas says. You can try using them only on the upper teeth first so that the difference is more visible. (Then apply them to the lower teeth.) Keep in mind that the older you get, the more you can see the yellowish dentin underneath your enamel, which — along with crowns and implants — is not affected by strips. So you might end up with uneven colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZI3XIH32ERFINLVJ3CHX3PJBFI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Strips can also cause sensitivity, particularly if you already have sensitive areas from gum recession, Cram says. So leave them on only as long as instructed on the package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ALTLSAHZFJFRRPE2J5RFR4UR5A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouthwash:&lt;/b&gt; Because swishing it around can coat parts of your teeth’s surface that are harder to reach with other tools, mouthwash can be a nice adjunct to your dental care routine, particularly if you choose one that has fluoride. Prescription washes that contain chlorhexidine can also be helpful for people with bleeding gums or other severe gum problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h5 class="wpds-c-vXjlY wpds-c-vXjlY-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" data-apitype="header" level="6" id="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q"&gt;Copyright 2024, Consumer Reports Inc.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer and healthier world.

Researchers found that semaglutide reduced inflammation in the brains of genetically modified mice that mimic Alzheimer’s disease and improved their memory performance. The findings, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2024.11.022" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, add to growing evidence that diabetes medications may offer benefits for neurodegenerative diseases, though more research is needed to understand how these drugs exert their effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide is a medication sold under brand names such as Ozempic and Wegovy, commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. It belongs to a class of drugs known as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, which help regulate blood sugar and appetite. In recent years, scientists have discovered that these drugs may have additional benefits beyond metabolic control, including potential protective effects in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease gradually damages nerve cells in the brain, leading to memory loss and cognitive decline. This deterioration is linked to the buildup of toxic proteins, chronic inflammation, and impaired energy metabolism in brain cells. Some studies suggest that semaglutide may help by reducing brain inflammation and preventing cell damage, but the precise mechanism is not yet fully understood. The new study aimed to investigate how semaglutide affects brain inflammation and memory function in a well-established mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test semaglutide’s effects, the researchers used a well-established mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease known as APP/PS1/tau transgenic mice. These mice carry genetic mutations that cause the buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles, the two main hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. The study also included a group of normal, healthy mice for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice were divided into four groups: a control group of normal mice given a placebo, a group of Alzheimer’s model mice given a placebo, a group of normal mice given semaglutide, and a group of Alzheimer’s model mice treated with semaglutide. The researchers administered semaglutide at a dose of 25 nanomoles per kilogram every other day for 30 days. After the treatment period, the mice underwent behavioral tests to assess their memory and learning abilities. The researchers also examined brain tissue to measure levels of inflammation and amyloid plaque buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that semaglutide improved both short-term and long-term memory in the Alzheimer’s model mice. In a test called the Y-maze, which measures spatial working memory, untreated Alzheimer’s model mice performed significantly worse than normal mice. However, those treated with semaglutide showed improved memory performance, nearly matching the healthy control mice. Similarly, in the Morris water maze, a test that assesses long-term spatial memory, semaglutide-treated mice found the hidden platform more quickly than untreated Alzheimer’s model mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a biological level, semaglutide reduced the amount of amyloid plaque in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory. The researchers also found that semaglutide lowered levels of inflammatory molecules such as interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which are known to contribute to brain cell damage. At the same time, semaglutide increased levels of anti-inflammatory molecules such as interleukin-4 and interleukin-10, which help protect brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key findings was that semaglutide appeared to change the behavior of microglia, the brain’s immune cells. In Alzheimer’s disease, microglia become overly activated and release harmful inflammatory substances. Semaglutide encouraged microglia to shift from a pro-inflammatory state, known as the M1 type, to an anti-inflammatory state, known as the M2 type. This transformation is thought to reduce brain damage and promote healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further investigate how semaglutide affects inflammation, the researchers conducted additional experiments using cultured microglial cells. When these cells were exposed to amyloid beta, a toxic protein linked to Alzheimer’s, they became inflamed and started releasing harmful substances. However, when the cells were pretreated with semaglutide, they produced fewer inflammatory molecules and were less likely to undergo cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, semaglutide did not appear to increase the number of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors in the brain, which are the drug’s primary target in diabetes treatment. This suggests that semaglutide may enhance the sensitivity of existing receptors rather than increasing their quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings are promising, the study has several limitations. First, the research was conducted in mice, and it is unclear whether the same effects will be seen in humans. While semaglutide has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier, its precise effects on human brain inflammation and memory remain to be fully tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the study focused primarily on microglia, but other brain cells, such as astrocytes, also play a role in neuroinflammation and may be influenced by semaglutide. Future research should investigate whether semaglutide affects other types of brain cells and how these changes contribute to neuroprotection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, while this study focused on short-term treatment effects, Alzheimer’s disease progresses over many years. Future studies should examine whether long-term semaglutide treatment can slow cognitive decline in aging animals and, ultimately, in people with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide is currently being tested in large-scale clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease, and if the results are positive, it could become one of the first medications to treat both diabetes and neurodegeneration. These findings add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that drugs designed for metabolic disorders might also hold promise for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2024.11.022" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Semaglutide promotes the transition of microglia from M1 to M2 type to reduce brain inflammation in APP/PS1/tau mice&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Zhao-Jun Wang, Wei-Na Han, Shi-Fan Chai, Yan Li, Chao-Jing Fu, Chen-Fang Wang, Hong-Yan Cai, Xin-Yi Li, Xiao Wang, Christian Hölscher, and Mei-Na Wu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 18:02:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxObGhiVTBBZUFqMDM4aFVYTW5Qa0J4bGRWWDNRUWtJemkyaTJLdVdaSnZjT3htbEQ5V1kwdUlCNWhuTlFEQ2xPMVR6b05MQTk5Wm5hY3piQUFfUG9TVnpLbnF5Z2h5U0VDM2RKLTZoaUlTM0hWZUtuaFhVel9mMFJZSFZPdkpLWDlCMkU1Tm9ycTlTTHdjSHV5V1dIOXJlU0g4YldxaGtLeFNsQQ</guid></item><item><title>Ingredient hidden in your spice rack could reverse Alzheimer's disease - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A compound hiding inside rosemary and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/sage/index.html" id="mol-dcc956c0-0343-11f0-aed6-9745f7e1d595" class=""&gt;sage&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In experiments with mice, scientists compared an Alzheimer's-like brain (left) to ones treated with diAcCA, appearing as the more intense green color (right) because of the increased number of neuronal synapses — connections between nerve cells that underlie learning and memory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Herbs like rosemary and sage contain carnosic acid, which is an antioxidant that has anti-inflammatory properties that can ease Alzheimer's-related damage in the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/14/3/293"&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, revealed that diAcCA is only activated by the inflammation it's trying to fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That means the carnosic acid-based treatment will only be active in areas of the brain suffering from inflammation, limiting any possible side-effects medications often have when they encounter healthy tissue - like cancer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Until now, it's been extremely difficult to use carnosic acid as a drug or supplement because the compound is too unstable to use in its pure form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Scripps team created a derivative of the rosemary and sage compound that's capable of reaching the gut before it breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once there, diAcCA turns back into carnosic acid and it's absorbed into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Stuart Lipton noted that the mice his team used in their experiments absorbed 20 percent more carnosic acid this way than they would have trying to ingest carnosic acid in its pure form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This allowed more of the compound to pass through the blood-brain barrier and treat life-threatening pockets of brain inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lipton added that this drug doesn't just rid the brain of what's driving Alzheimer's disease, the mice taking it quickly regained the cognitive skills dementia affects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We did multiple different tests of memory, and they were all improved with the drug,' Lipton said in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2025/20250319-lipton-alzheimers.html"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It didn't just slow down the decline;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, affecting nearly 7 million Americans over the age of 65&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used a group of 45 mice, split into smaller bunches of seven or eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These weren't just any mice - they were 5xFAD mice, bred to develop Alzheimer's-like symptoms, including memory loss and brain damage, by the time they're about five months-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once reaching that age, the team gave them diAcCA or a placebo (olive oil) three times a week for three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also tried three different doses - 10, 20, or 50 milligrams - to see what worked best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the three months, the scientists put the mice through a series of cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One was a water maze, where the mice swam in a pool to find a hidden platform they could stand on. Healthy mice get better at finding it over time, but Alzheimer's mice struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also conducted a fear test, where mice learn to freeze when they hear a sound linked to a mild shock, testing their memory of scary moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team then looked inside the mice's brains using special microscopes to see if the drug changed the harmful plaque buildups, protein tangles, or brain cell connections associated with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results were jaw-dropping. Mice given diAcCA, especially at the higher doses, swam to the platform faster and spent more time where it used to be, showing they remembered its spot better than the untreated Alzheimer's mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the fear test, they froze more often, proving their memory was sharper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under the microscope, their brains looked healthier too — displaying fewer plaques and tangles, more brain cell connections, and less inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By combating inflammation and oxidative stress with this diAcCA compound, we actually increased the number of synapses in the brain,' Dr. Lipton added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although this isn't a definitive cure for Alzheimer's yet, researchers are extremely hopeful that what they've found in your kitchen herbs represents a major leap forward in treating dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team added that diAcCA may also make it possible for existing Alzheimer's treatments to work better - by eliminating additional inflammation around the brain that usually hinders their effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigators working on the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program found out last week that the National Institutes of Health has halted funding for the project. While they have not yet received confirmation from the agency on why the grant has been canceled, the decision appears likely related to the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/11/columbia-scientists-reel-grant-cancellations-hit-broad-suite-research/"&gt;cancellation&lt;/a&gt; of federal grants to Columbia University on the grounds that it had failed to adequately address antisemitism on campus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 2022, Columbia has been managing funding for the most recent phase of the program, which is focused on tracking the development of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias among participants. But over 90% of the current funding, which amounts to more than $80 million spanning five years, is ultimately distributed to over two dozen other research sites across the U.S., according to José Luchsinger, a Columbia professor and one of the principal investigators. &lt;/p&gt;
