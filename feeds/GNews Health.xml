However, the study included only healthy adults and excluded people with serious conditions like diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The authors recommended that anyone considering this type of fasting talk to their doctor and a registered dietician.

If your core is weak, your back and other muscles have to do extra work, which can lead to pain or injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not just athletes who need a strong core. Everyday activities like bending down to tie your shoes or picking up groceries become way easier when your core is in check.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the coach, people in their 20s should be able to do 40 to 50 crunches  as your core is 'at its prime'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/28/health/how-many-crunches-you-should-be-able-to-do-at-every-age/"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;: 'Think of it as a warmup for all the adventures your abs will support, like dancing all night or carrying groceries in one trip.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then states that those in their in their 30s should manage&lt;span&gt; to do 30 to 40 crunches - noting that 'this is the decade to focus on maintaining strength while juggling work, family and Netflix binges'. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The long-time trainer added that those in their 40s should be able to 20 to 30 crunches as 'your metabolism might slow'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;David also stated that 'consistency is key' and it is important to make sure you are getting some form of exercise in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The New Yorker further recommend that people in their 50s should be able to push through 15 to 25 crunches to 'stay active and strong'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from this, people who are aged 60 and above should be able to do 10 to 20 crunches comfortably. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While David admits that the total number of crunches you are able to do varies from person to person, he also warns that being unable to perform the minimum for your age group could be a red flag for your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'In some cases, difficulty performing crunches could point to underlying issues like back problems, joint pain or even cardiovascular fitness levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It also likely means that your body is craving more and it is your job to give it what it needs and deserves.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finding it difficult to perform exercises while accompanied with chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or palpitations, may indicate a potential heart health problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the long run, less active people reportedly have a 30 to 50 percent greater risk of developing high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Strengthening the core muscles through crunches can also help stabilize the spine and reduce the risk of lower back pain and injuries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical inactivity is also one of the key reasons along with cigarette smoking, high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol that can pave the way for cardiovascular diseases, the New York Department of Health states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the American Heart Association, only about one in five adults and teens get enough exercise to maintain good health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency recommends adults to engage in moderate-intensity aerobic activity for about 150 minutes per week, 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity or a combination of both, preferably spread throughout the week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 16:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxOcW5HRTlRbDFSamZtWElXbWtBMFBsX1ZkcXlWUzRUall0MU9rYzJ3cnR2YThIT2daSzhIUk82UTFEblBFNW5KTTA2TG9yeExxWElFRUxHRklvVl9xUjRqZDNYV0dEckh0ZVlaOXY2dFBwOHZSME15VV9Gb3lEU01mU1Eya2NsMTYtcFc5Y3VnTEN2RGZhaXlsa1Z6VUNSOWsz0gGmAUFVX3lxTE5WZkREa0hBTVVLS05KdjI2YTBuRnY3TjVIX1g1MzhNaXp0THVSZW9rbG9UUExIckdRaVpOaS1lemh0MEJCNWttVG1QYU53U3hDR3pra3l3NHlxSkVNTUhHU1AxVVN0UU1Ra0VWMkoyRTdockVFVHFoZDYwd3k3Wjk5NURZNkNzT0tWYmlDbm5UWVp2elZNeWRObTl6WHlQTHVOMUFlbUE</guid></item><item><title>Low Testosterone?

It's essential for sex drive, muscle growth and strength, and bone density. However, it's important for more than that, according to Madison Reeder, director of clinical operations at &lt;a href="https://modifyhealth.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;ModifyHealth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;"It plays a far more expansive role by supporting cellular signaling, protein synthesis, fat distribution, and cognitive and emotional regulation," Reeder said. The processes supported by testosterone influence everything from muscle maintenance to red blood cell production to energy levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/testosterone-imbalance-signs/" target="_self"&gt;all need testosterone&lt;/a&gt; at some level to feel our best, though it's central to men's health. Low testosterone (also called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532933/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;hypogonadism&lt;/a&gt;) occurs when the testicles aren't producing enough testosterone. It's more common than you might think. It's estimated that &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/hypogonadism" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;35% of men over 45&lt;/a&gt; years of age have hypogonadism.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lifestyle changes like moderating alcohol and quitting smoking are necessary for maintaining testosterone levels, another important factor is what you eat. Packing your diet with certain foods may help boost your testosterone levels to a healthy range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do testosterone levels vary?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testosterone naturally fluctuates. According to Dr. Justin Houman, an assistant professor of urology at &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/home.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Cedars-Sinai Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, testosterone levels are generally at their highest point in the morning and decline throughout the day, in line with the body's circadian rhythm. Testosterone also changes throughout life. It sharply increases during puberty and gradually decreases after age 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beyond that, fluctuations can be influenced by a wide range of factors: &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/get-better-sleep-for-sleep-awareness-month-with-these-6-simple-tips/" target="_self"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/carefree-era-tactics-relieve-stress/" target="_self"&gt;stress levels&lt;/a&gt; (particularly &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/blood-stress-test-cortisol-effects-our-bodies/" target="_self"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt;), body fat percentage, alcohol consumption, certain medications and even acute or chronic illness," said Houman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pituitary gland is central to regulating testosterone production in the body, and it's a sensitive system that can easily be thrown off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things that can &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15603-low-testosterone-male-hypogonadism" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;impact testosterone levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; include but are not limited to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Urological Association, low testosterone is a &lt;a href="https://www.auanet.org/guidelines-and-quality/guidelines/testosterone-deficiency-guideline" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;level below 300 ng/dL&lt;/a&gt;. A healthy range is considered between 450 and 600ng/dL. "However, there is no "one-size-fits-all" testosterone level. The body's ideal level is influenced by age, sex, genetics, health history, and even how well you sleep or manage stress," Reeder said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're struggling with low testosterone, one of the first places you can look is your diet. Unhealthy diets or chronic under-fueling can impair hormone production while working toward a balanced diet full of nutrients can help stabilize your levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9 foods that may increase testosterone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There isn't a single 'testosterone superfood,' but certain foods support the body's natural testosterone production by providing key nutrients or reducing inflammation and oxidative stress," Houman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nutritional content of certain foods can give you a leg up when it comes to testosterone, especially if you're deficient in that particular nutrient. Reeder pointed to zinc, vitamin D, magnesium, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/keep-your-heart-healthy-with-omega-3s-heres-how-to-add-them-to-your-diet/" target="_self"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; and high-quality protein as pivotal nutrients for healthy testosterone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding the foods on this list to your diet won't magically fix low testosterone levels. However, being intentional about making good food choices can help supplement level management as you speak to your doctor. Your needs will vary depending on your age, health conditions and hormonal status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Milan_Jovic/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Leafy greens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens like spinach, kale and collard greens contain a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/different-types-of-magnesium/" target="_self"&gt;lot of magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, which can help regulate &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/testosterone-levels-test/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;total and free testosterone&lt;/a&gt;. Research &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7830687/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;points to magnesium deficiency&lt;/a&gt; as another nutrient that plays a role in low testosterone. Magnesium reduces &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5551541/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, or the body's imbalance of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/antioxidant-rich-foods-and-why-you-need-more-antioxidants/" target="_self"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; and free radicals. Reducing oxidative stress benefits testosterone bioactivity because inflammation and oxidative stress can lower testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating leafy greens may help boost testosterone levels. However, if you're not a big green eater, beans, nuts and dark chocolate are also excellent sources of magnesium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish have a lot going for them in the testosterone department. They are great sources of "good fats" known as omega-3s, which are known to support heart and joint health. Research has revealed that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33741447/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;low-fat diets can be associated&lt;/a&gt; with lower testosterone levels. While we need more research to fully understand why this is, adding healthy fats to your diet, like fatty fish, can benefit your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not the only benefit of fatty fish. They have a high nutritional content of essential vitamins like zinc and vitamin D, which are crucial for healthy testosterone levels. Those with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10518189/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;less vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; tend to have lower testosterone levels than those with more vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can take a fish oil supplement if you're not a fish eater. A 2020 study found that &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0952327820301629" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;fish oil supplements with omega-3s&lt;/a&gt; boost testosterone in men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cruciferous vegetables &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Houman explained that cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts can indirectly support healthier testosterone balance by lowering estrogen levels. They can do this because cruciferous vegetables have a compound called &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/indole-3-carbinol" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;indole-3-carbinol&lt;/a&gt;. Some studies suggest that indole-3-carbinol may slow cancer cell growth, though the research is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;DragonImages/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eggs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs can help maintain healthy testosterone levels because they contain vitamin D and healthy fats. They also contain the antioxidant selenium. Animal studies have found that selenium can increase &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28257863/#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28257863/%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22testosterone%20production%22}" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;testosterone production&lt;/a&gt;. However, it's important to remember that we don't have human studies to draw any conclusions about the extent of the relationship between selenium and testosterone. Regardless, eggs are highly nutritious and contain other testosterone-friendly nutrients. One smaller study found that eating the &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2021/02000/whole_egg_vs__egg_white_ingestion_during_12_weeks.17.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;whole egg will be better&lt;/a&gt; for testosterone levels than egg whites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Avocados&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados are a triple threat when it comes to boosting testosterone levels. They are a great source of healthy fats and magnesium and &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Boron-HealthProfessional/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;contain boron&lt;/a&gt;, a trace element linked to testosterone production. One study found that within a week of taking boron supplements, testosterone levels in males &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4712861/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased up to 32%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Oysters and other shellfish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Houman, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-zinc-supplements/" target="_self"&gt;zinc is an essential nutrient&lt;/a&gt; for testosterone synthesis in the testes. Oysters offer the most zinc per serving than any food. Other shellfish, like shrimp, clams, mussels, crab and lobster, have notable zinc levels. If seafood isn't your thing, red meat, pumpkin seeds and lentils are other zinc-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the benefits of zinc, oysters and other shellfish's antioxidant effect may boost testosterone by &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556007/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increasing the efficiency of the Leydig cells&lt;/a&gt;, the primary source of testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-food-sources-of-zinc/" target="_self"&gt;15 Best Food Sources of Zinc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Select fruits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fruits with flavonoid antioxidants, like pomegranates, berries and cherries, can help support testosterone production. A study of active young men found that drinking two cups of pure pomegranate juice each day for three weeks helped with muscle recovery, reduced inflammation and saw an &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.ajme.2017.03.005" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increase in testosterone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Olive oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olive oil has several health benefits, like increasing &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/naturally-boost-your-heart-health-with-these-5-foods/" target="_self"&gt;good cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and lowering &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/cholesterol-everything-you-should-know/" target="_self"&gt;bad cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. There is also some evidence that it may increase testosterone. One small study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research of 60 young males discovered that a daily intake of around five teaspoons of &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2021/02000/whole_egg_vs__egg_white_ingestion_during_12_weeks.17.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;extra virgin olive oil increased testosterone by 17%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fermented foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reeder explained that gut health is gaining more attention for its role in hormone regulation. Fermented foods like yogurt and kimchi can indirectly support testosterone levels by ensuring your &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5433529/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; is healthy. A healthy gut plays a role in inflammation and hormone metabolism, so eating &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/probiotic-foods-naturally-boost-gut-health/" target="_self"&gt;gut-friendly foods&lt;/a&gt; is always good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While eating these foods won't artificially raise testosterone beyond your body's natural capacity, they can help create the right environment for hormonal stability," Reeder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Jose Luis Pelaez Inc/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the best diet for boosting testosterone levels?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any balanced diet that includes testosterone-friendly foods is a good option. However, if you're looking for a specific diet to help you create meals, try the Mediterranean diet. It's rich in lean proteins, healthy fats and plenty of veggies. Houman explained that following a Mediterranean diet has been linked to higher testosterone levels and better reproductive health in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't have to follow the &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/ultimate-guide-mediterranean-diet-2025-healthiest-diet/" target="_self"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; to boost your testosterone levels; you can focus on healthy eating habits to see the benefits. However, it's essential to acknowledge what not to do. Houman explained that ultra-processed foods and high-sugar diets can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11412839/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;suppress testosterone&lt;/a&gt; by promoting insulin resistance.

Fats, especially those from whole food sources, provide cholesterol, a crucial building block for hormone production," Reeder said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't cut out all fats from your diet or you may see a hormone level drop. Instead, focus on high-quality fats and moderate how often you eat processed foods. If you don't know where to start with your diet or how to recognize your food patterns, working with a registered dietitian can help you find a diet that works best for your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other natural ways to boost testosterone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything starts with the foods you eat, though your diet isn't the only thing that could impact your testosterone levels.

Beyond confirming the presence of the disease, the test also helps determine the stage of its progression. This may fundamentally change how physicians manage Alzheimer’s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test was developed by experts at &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; and Lund University in Sweden. Their studies indicate that a particular blood protein, MTBR-tau243, can be used to monitor the extent of dangerous tau accumulation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tangles of tau protein are some of the hallmark characteristics of Alzheimer’s and are directly proportional to the intensity of the symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new technique is considerably more convenient than brain scans since it is non-invasive, and does not require expensive procedures that are difficult to access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracking-alzheimer-s-with-a-blood-test"&gt;Tracking Alzheimer’s with a blood test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, doctors can use several blood &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blood-tests-offer-new-hope-in-detecting-alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tests&lt;/a&gt; to help detect Alzheimer’s. Some of the tests that are already in use are based on earlier discoveries at Washington University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tests look for early warning signs but don’t reveal how much the disease has progressed. That’s a crucial gap. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/medical-breakthrough-new-vaccine-may-prevent-alzheimers-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s treatments&lt;/a&gt; are most helpful in the early stages, before too much damage has been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a way to tell whether someone is in an early or late phase of the disease would help doctors decide which treatment would work best. It could also clarify whether a person’s memory or thinking issues are actually caused by Alzheimer’s or something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This blood test clearly identifies Alzheimer’s tau tangles, which is our best biomarker measure of Alzheimer’s symptoms and dementia,” said co-senior author Dr. Randall J. Bateman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In clinical practice right now, we don’t have easy or accessible measures of Alzheimer’s tangles and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, and so a tangle blood test like this can provide a much better indication if the symptoms are due to Alzheimer’s and may also help doctors decide which treatments are best for their patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-reliable-way-to-monitor-the-disease"&gt;A reliable way to monitor the disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s typically starts with a buildup of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleeping-may-lower-levels-of-alzheimers-abnormal-proteins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;amyloid protein&lt;/a&gt; in the brain. Tau tangles develop later and mark the point when symptoms begin to show. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to see these changes has been through PET scans, which can track amyloid and tau deposits. But these scans are expensive, time-consuming, and often only available in large hospitals or research centers. That’s why scientists have been working on blood-based alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team had already developed blood tests that measure amyloid plaque buildup. Earlier research showed that levels of MTBR-tau243 in spinal fluid could match up with brain tau levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new study, the researchers demonstrated that they could get the same results using blood samples. A blood draw is much easier and more accessible than a spinal tap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-the-new-approach"&gt;Testing the new approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate the test, the researchers used data from two groups of people. One group came from a research center at Washington University and included 108 volunteers. The other group included 55 people from a Swedish study known as BioFINDER-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the experts checked their findings with data from 739 additional people in the BioFINDER-2 group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These participants represented a range of Alzheimer’s stages – from people who had no symptoms but had amyloid in their brains, to those with mild cognitive issues, to people with full dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also included individuals with memory or thinking problems due to other conditions, and some who were cognitively healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alzheimer-s-progression-revealed-in-blood"&gt;Alzheimer’s progression revealed in blood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were promising. MTBR-tau243 levels in the blood matched the amount of tau tangles in the brain with 92% accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In healthy people and those in the earliest stage of the disease, the levels were normal. But in people showing symptoms, the protein levels were clearly elevated – and much higher in those with advanced disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This difference made it easy to tell who was in an early or late stage of Alzheimer’s. It also helped distinguish Alzheimer’s dementia from other kinds of cognitive problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of clarity could make a huge difference in choosing the right treatment path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new test uses technology licensed by Washington University to C2N Diagnostics, which previously developed similar blood tests for amyloid plaques. The earlier tests were designed to detect another tau protein called p-tau217.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe we will use blood-based p-tau217 to determine whether an individual has Alzheimer’s disease, but MTBR-tau243 will be a highly valuable complement in both clinical settings and research trials,” said Oskar Hansson, a professor of neurology at Lund University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When both of these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alzheimers-disease-earliest-biomarker-protein-psd-95-identified/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biomarkers&lt;/a&gt; are positive, the likelihood that Alzheimer’s is the underlying cause of a person’s cognitive symptoms increases significantly, compared to when only p-tau217 is abnormal. This distinction is crucial for selecting the most appropriate treatment for each patient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead-to-better-treatments"&gt;Looking ahead to better treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are two FDA-approved drugs that target amyloid in the brain to slow Alzheimer’s. But more treatments are being tested – including ones that aim at tau protein and other disease mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As these therapies become available, doctors will need reliable ways to match the right treatment to each stage of the disease. Blood tests could be the key to this shift toward personalized Alzheimer’s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re about to enter the era of personalized medicine for Alzheimer’s disease,” said Kanta Horie, a research associate professor of neurology at WashU Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For early stages with low tau tangles, anti-amyloid therapies could be more efficacious than in late stages.

By labeling synaptic proteins before and after behavioral training, scientists can now visualize where and how neural connections shift over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique revealed changes in the synaptic protein GluA2 in specific brain regions linked to new learning and across the brain in enriched environments. DELTA opens the door to uncovering the molecular basis of learning and memory by bridging the gap between behavior and cellular changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole-Brain View:&lt;/strong&gt; DELTA maps where synaptic protein changes occur during learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning in Action:&lt;/strong&gt; Protein GluA2 changes reveal brain regions engaged by new tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Versatile Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; DELTA can track synaptic shifts in both standard and enriched environments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;HHMI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janelia researchers have developed a new way to map how individual connections between neurons change across the entire brain during learning, giving scientists a new view into how changes in behavior show up in the brain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons communicate with each other by passing millisecond-long signals across tiny junctions called synapses. Experiences cause the strength of these connections to change – a process called synaptic plasticity, which underlies learning and memory.

The work was led by the Spruston and Lavis labs and the lab of former Janelia Senior Group Leader Karel Svoboda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new imaging method, DELTA, provides scientists with a brain-wide map of how individual synaptic proteins change over time. Proteins important for synaptic plasticity are known to be degraded or synthesized as synaptic connections change. So, tracking these synaptic protein changes during learning enables scientists to also understand how synaptic connections change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This information allows researchers to home in on areas of the brain that might be important for learning and memory and helps them figure out the molecular mechanisms behind the synaptic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the problems in figuring out which molecules are in charge of what changes is that it’s very hard to know where those changes are happening. We didn’t have good way of figuring out where in the brain things are changing so we can focus our attention on the most interesting parts,” says Boaz Mohar, a Research Scientist in the Spruston Lab who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now we have a different way of looking at our manipulations and how they affect the circuit at the brain-wide level by using imaging to drill down on the subcellular structure. This helps us bridge that gap between behavior and mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method works by first labeling a synaptic protein of interest in the mouse brain with a bright Janelia Fluor (JF) dye. To investigate how synaptic connections change during learning, the researchers used mice that had already been trained to on a simple task: learning to associate two distinct visual cues with a water reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this initial labeling, the mice were split into two groups: one group received water randomly at the two cues, as they had prior to labeling, while the task for the other group was modified such that only one of the cues was associated with the water reward. After a few days, once the researchers saw a clear difference between the two groups’ actions, the same synaptic protein of interest was labeled with a different JF dye in both groups of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over those days, some of the original labeled proteins are degraded and some new proteins are synthesized, incorporating the second dye. By imaging the entire brain, researchers can see where the synaptic proteins have changed in both groups of mice, giving them a hint as to where changes in synaptic connections are happening during learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers saw that learning the modified task caused the synaptic protein they studied, GluA2, to change in specific brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also used the new method to see differences in protein turnover in mice living in a normal environment and mice living in an enriched environment with toys and companions. In this case, putting a mouse in an enriched environment caused widespread changes in GluA2 across the entire brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By enabling researchers to see these brain-wide changes, DELTA gives scientists a starting point for follow up studies to detail the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a next step, the researchers are working to add additional features to DELTA that will allow them to pinpoint when proteins are changing during the few days the animals are learning a task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the lab heads who led the project, Nelson Spruston, says the development of DELTA exemplifies the collaborative spirit of the research campus, with scientists across Janelia lending their knowledge in chemistry, imaging, behavior, and genetics to the project. The team also collaborated with experts outside Janelia, including researchers at Northwestern University who helped to validate the method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the team is working with scientists around the world to help them use DELTA to track synaptic changes in their own research, collaborations enabled through Janelia’s Visiting Scientist Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a quintessential Janelia project,” Spruston says. “It involved doing something that nobody has ever done before and required collaboration with lots of people who contributed expertise to make this all possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain mapping and synaptic plasticity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#70121f1d0015091e3018181d195e1f0217" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanci Bompey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hhmi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HHMI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Nanci Bompey – HHMI&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01923-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DELTA: a method for brain-wide measurement of synaptic protein turnover reveals localized plasticity during learning&lt;/a&gt;” by Boaz Mohar et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DELTA: a method for brain-wide measurement of synaptic protein turnover reveals localized plasticity during learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synaptic plasticity alters neuronal connections in response to experience, which is thought to underlie learning and memory. However, the loci of learning-related synaptic plasticity, and the degree to which plasticity is localized or distributed, remain largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we describe a new method, DELTA, for mapping brain-wide changes in synaptic protein turnover with single-synapse resolution, based on Janelia Fluor dyes and HaloTag knock-in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During associative learning, the turnover of the ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit GluA2, an indicator of synaptic plasticity, was enhanced in several brain regions, most markedly hippocampal area CA1. More broadly distributed increases in the turnover of synaptic proteins were observed in response to environmental enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In CA1, GluA2 stability was regulated in an input-specific manner, with more turnover in layers containing input from CA3 compared to entorhinal cortex. DELTA will facilitate exploration of the molecular and circuit basis of learning and memory and other forms of plasticity at scales ranging from single synapses to the entire brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 13:28:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5TZHJRRXVRY05yTkFuakRWems3Y2dGX2NhdENRUzI4OGpaMTloSjVFUmRtX1BHZzJUb28zYkdkdUlxWWpfLVdZUzZhLW9udW4tWGZGM2gtOERaY0c1YWpPT0Y1NHg3czl6MG5mYk1qN0Fhd3dv</guid></item><item><title>Stress has a sweet spot. 5 tips to help you find it - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQNjlzVGQ0Tlc0QjJpejRvU2xzZy01b05yeWYtYWFSWHFfd1VORGk4SWt3T1VlTDM3dEZRN0ZLR0xad08xNDZOY1FkMG01eTJaSjU3OFNLeGhvcG16OWZoS0ZmNWdraE5ValYzQ3EzNTJvaEN4TFRITDE0UktTeGV6aTZPSTB4MmPSAX5BVV95cUxONXJzcUJrQm9fS2pBaUJCVnRiYy0yalgwMFlQS2xqNlhrUlFqUDFDYjV2bUxBaTVXZVFBLTV2UUp0SXFnbTdyNC1pbTV6bHFheUxVUThWWHZyeXY2U3JGY214WjJ2M21tM1pEbzlCYWVuWGlnVkRmWjlVczMtSWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            And it’s true: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/04/health/stress-health-connection-wellness/index.html"&gt;stress can be detrimental&lt;/a&gt;, and lead to a whole host of ills, especially when it becomes chronic, unrelenting.

            But, it turns out, certain types of stress can &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/21/health/keep-cool-under-pressure-wellness/index.html"&gt;lead to growth opportunities&lt;/a&gt; and, according to one doctor and author of the new book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stress-Paradox-Essential-Management-Mind-Body-Soul-ebook/dp/B0CW13NLBZ" target="_blank"&gt;“The Stress Paradox: Why You Need Stress to Live Longer, Healthier, and Happier,”&lt;/a&gt; the right amount of it may actually be crucial to our wellbeing.

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfwfqz000r3b6m0vkq5mbz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bergquist, an assistant professor at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and the founder and director of &lt;a href="https://www.emoryhealthcare.org/centers-programs/lifestyle-medicine-wellness" target="_blank"&gt;Emory Lifestyle Medicine &amp;amp; Wellness&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;knows a thing or two about stress. As a child, she lived through the Iranian Revolution and ultimately her family was forced to flee.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfwfqz000s3b6mfpjvocf3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We were the last plane to leave before (Iranian leader Ruhollah) Khomeini came,” she recalled. “The airport was incredibly packed. I remember the whole process of trying to get through security and just the mass of people that were there and how we got onto the runway — every step of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfwfqz000t3b6m2hjq6t5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her family fled to England, and eventually they settled in the United States. But life wasn’t exactly stress-free in the West either. “In eighth grade I could not write a paragraph in English without a lot of struggle. It would take me all night,” she said. Yet she managed to prosper, graduate as her high school’s valedictorian, attend Yale University as an undergraduate and then Harvard Medical School.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfwfqz000u3b6mgugrmm7q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bergquist’s childhood experiences planted the seeds for her interest in stress. “Ultimately it triggered this obsession for me of, why is it that some people grow and thrive from these experiences? And others don’t?” she said. She said she became really interested in the question of whether all stress is harmful.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cm8xfwjsg000w3b6m7reygeve@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfw6ro000o3b6mzh8bpm5w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to Bergquist’s research, it turns out that it depends on the type and amount of stress a person’s exposed to.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00113b6mnaioufys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I work with a lot of professionals (who) are very driven, but are also so passionate about what they do,” she said, noting that they lead what can be considered “stressful” lives. She counts herself among them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00123b6m5mfhqda5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I call that good stress, which I think has a very different effect on our bodies than the harmful stress that has become almost synonymous with what people describe as ‘stress’” she said. “I think I can now say with a comfortable level, that (the good) type of stress releases a biochemical profile that is actually health promoting: we release, for example, dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00133b6myjrvtmlt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The dopamine is from the reward for doing something meaningful, she explained. The serotonin is from the joy that comes from accomplishment and the oxytocin is from contributing to the greater good.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00143b6mw7w9aazv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said “bad” stress is unpredictable, unavoidable, and not brief or intermittent but rather chronic. Our biochemical response to that type of stress is to release cortisol which eventually leads to the harmful downstream effects on our bodies, such as high blood pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00153b6ma9m5jns1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That trifecta of chemicals released when we take on good stress “mitigates our cortisol level. It literally builds our resilience to stress,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00163b6m8zxfswra@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Resilience is like a muscle: It is dynamic and needs to be challenged to get stronger.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00173b6m06wecz7g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The key, really, is that our stress responses are there to help us. They’re there to help us adapt to our world,” she said, noting that for the entirety of human history that is how humans have survived and thrived.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00183b6m696j75er@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But the things that help us activate those stress responses have been removed from the fabric of our lives,” she said. No longer do we have to face environmental stressors such as food scarcity and exposure to extremes of heat and cold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw00193b6mx4ihwmte@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The introduction of a lot of these comforts has removed our connection with the natural environment that we live in,” she said. Consequently “we are essentially handicapping ourselves because we are not allowing our bodies to do what they are so capable of doing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001a3b6m1thhggzp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What can you do to introduce good stress into your life? Bergquist has five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001b3b6m5zw85epl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Challenge yourself to go outside your comfort zone without feeling overwhelmed,” said Bergquist via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001c3b6ma6d3g7r8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Good stress is medicine. And like any medicine, the dose determines the response,” she explained. “Growth from stress happens when stress is in a hormetic, or Goldilocks, zone — a just right amount that’s not too much or too little.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001d3b6mwyalwifz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In other words, push yourself to get in the water and swim, but don’t let yourself drown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001e3b6m5kx3q32t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Are you challenging yourself in ways that align with your beliefs? Or conflict with them?” Bergquist asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001f3b6mqb86l8au@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Your heart and mind know the difference,” she said. “Persevering in situations where you feel stuck or disconnected from your values can become a harmful form of stress.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001g3b6m0vt1v1yq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Good stress is not about simply positively reframing the stress in our lives,” she said. “But instead, deliberately taking action with meaningful and purpose-driven challenges as an antidote to the chronic stressors that we can’t control or avoid.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001h3b6mag0uo3yd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, she said, it could involve accepting or creating a job opportunity that aligns with your values or learning a skill that you find rewarding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001i3b6mzh42j0q8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “To grow from stress, you have to make time for rest and recovery,” Bergquist said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001j3b6moz69d5hg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Under stress, your body switches into a mode where you conserve energy and do internal housekeeping,” she said. “When you recover, your brain and body remodel and build new connections that better prepare you for future challenges.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001k3b6mdni8hwib@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recovery, Bergquist said, is just as important as good stress to gain benefits. “Even good stress can build up to becoming harmful without recovery.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm8xfy05e001v3b6mpo96ro26@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="lean-into-the-connection-between-your-mind-and-body" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Lean into the connection between your mind and body
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001l3b6m7ee129a9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Physically stressing yourself can help build mental resilience and vice versa,” Bergquist said. “It’s a remarkable process called cross-adaptation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001m3b6m33y2nz1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you experience good physical or psychological stress, you repair and regenerate your cells, which makes every part of your body healthier and stronger,” she explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001n3b6mtyrfsv39@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You can build mental resilience, for example, by physically stressing yourself (in a good way) by doing things like “eating plant-based foods with stress resistance-building phytochemicals, exercising vigorously, briefly exposing yourself to heat and cold, and fasting intermittently through time-restricted eating,” she said. “We have many tools for managing stress and lessening its harm.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001o3b6mu90v2wof@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experiencing stress is not a glitch— it’s a feature. “Our human history is one of overcoming stress — and becoming stronger because of it,” Bergquist said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001p3b6mobup51i0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Through repeat cycles of stress and recovery, we summon our natural capability. It’s a gift we have inherited in our DNA,” she said. “Resilience is a muscle we can all build no matter where we are or what we are facing. It’s okay to have fears. And it’s okay to want to avoid challenges.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8xfxzqw001q3b6mmiai5zz3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Trust and do it anyway. The result can be life-changing,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The study shows that the right side of the brainstem’s locus coeruleus (LC) activates a specific pathway to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during vicarious fear, while the left side processes direct fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disabling the right LC-ACC pathway in mice erased their vicarious fear response, revealing the brain’s lateralized design for emotional processing. These findings offer new insights into empathy, social learning, and potential treatments for disorders like psychopathy, social anxiety, and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lateralized Processing:&lt;/strong&gt; The right brainstem (LC) regulates vicarious fear, while the left handles direct fear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vicarious Fear Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; A specialized LC→ACC circuit activates only during observed distress in others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may inform treatments for empathy-related psychiatric disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever felt a chill run down your spine while watching someone else in distress?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon, known as vicarious fear, allows us to experience fear by observing others—even when we are not in direct danger ourselves. This aligns with the concept of ‘putting oneself in another’s shoes’—both figuratively and, as research suggests, even neurologically. Just as we metaphorically step into another’s place to understand their emotions, our brain processes fear vicariously when we witness someone else’s distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108322"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of a person." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fear-empathy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While lateralization is well-known in language and motor control, this research shows that it also plays a role in emotional processing. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While essential for social learning and survival, the neural mechanisms distinguishing direct fear (from personal threats) and vicarious fear (from others’ distress) have remained a mystery—until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team led by Dr. SHIN Hee-sup at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) has uncovered a fundamental brain circuit that distinguishes these two types of fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings reveal that the locus coeruleus (LC), a small brainstem structure that produces norepinephrine (NA), plays a crucial role in processing fear—but in a lateralized manner, with the right and left hemispheres serving distinct functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have studied how the brain processes fear, focusing primarily on regions like the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The locus coeruleus (LC) has also been recognized as a key player in stress and fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, until now, it was unknown whether the LC treats direct and vicarious fear as one and the same—or whether the brain has evolved distinct pathways for these different experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using advanced neuroscience techniques such as optogenetics (light-based neural control), fiber photometry (real-time neural activity measurement), and viral tracing (mapping brain connections), the researchers pinpointed a specialized neural circuit that selectively processes vicarious fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They hypothesized that the right-hemisphere LC connects to the ACC to regulate fear learned from others, while a separate pathway governs direct fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the team selectively inhibited neural pathways in mice and observed their behavioral responses. When a mouse saw another mouse receiving a mild foot shock—a model of vicarious fear—its right LC-ACC circuit became highly active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when this pathway was silenced using optogenetics, the observing mouse no longer exhibited freezing behavior, a hallmark of fear. In contrast, deactivating the left-side LC had no effect on any of the fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments confirmed that this circuit relies on β-adrenergic receptors in the right ACC, as administering a beta-blocker (propranolol) also suppressed the vicarious fear response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also traced the inputs to the LC, identifying two key upstream regions: the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the central amygdala (CeA). Notably, the BNST→LC→ACC pathway was active only during vicarious fear, whereas the CeA→LC→BLA (basolateral amygdala) pathway was involved in both direct and vicarious fear, revealing a functional split in LC processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to demonstrate that the LC-NA system is functionally lateralized—meaning the brainstem itself has distinct right- and left-side roles in emotional processing. It also sheds light on how the brain differentiates between “your fear” and “mine,” providing insights into the neural basis of empathy and social learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings have significant implications for understanding and treating fear-related psychiatric conditions. Disorders such as psychopathy, antisocial personality disorder, social anxiety, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involve disruptions in fear regulation and social cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By identifying a dedicated neural circuit for vicarious fear, this research lays the groundwork for targeted therapies aimed at restoring normal fear processing in these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also contributes to a broader understanding of brain asymmetry—the idea that different sides of the brain handle different functions. While lateralization is well-known in language and motor control, this research shows that it also plays a role in emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the team plans to investigate whether similar pathways exist in the human brain. If so, this could bridge the gap between animal studies and clinical applications, potentially leading to new strategies for treating disorders related to fear and empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By revealing how our brains distinguish between direct and observed fear, this study sheds new light on the biological basis of empathy and emotional learning. It offers exciting possibilities for developing treatments for psychiatric conditions and deepens our understanding of how emotions are wired into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6a1d03060603191f022a03081944180f440118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;William Suh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ibs.re.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;William Suh – Institute for Basic Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-57701-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The lateralized LC-NAergic system distinguishes vicarious versus direct fear in mice&lt;/a&gt;” by SHIN Hee-sup et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lateralized LC-NAergic system distinguishes vicarious versus direct fear in mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear can be induced either directly through self-experience of aversive events or vicariously by observing conspecifics experiencing such events. The locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NA) system is crucial in fear responses and cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether the LC-NA system differentially processes these two types of fear, direct and vicarious in male mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results highlighted that the right hemisphere LC→anterior cingulate cortex pathway is uniquely crucial for vicarious fear, while the two inputs to the LC—from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the central amygdala (CeA)—differentially contribute to fear processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BNST plays a more targeted role in vicarious fear, and the CeA has a broader influence on fear in general. This underscores the complexity and specialization within the LC-NA system for fear-processing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 12:35:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1qTmMyMTJCbU1BMy0tTlJ1TWlHb2lDbmhva1ZsTU4yNkF3a0dKd0o5OXM1OHp5UE1fUlRqTnl3bnF3TjMwYkppSFUzTDVZMXZjT2FPdWJiQkFHMUZHQi12aGVQNC0</guid></item><item><title>Vitamin D Could Be an Effective Way to Slow Progress of MS - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOQkhTbTRkbVNnV1dUWE1PaWFhaEEzdXJ6ck1rN3ZZZWg0V3NKOE95cHF5OFdlTVM3VWdqbG04Zy1pZ1FSWFROdlpXZmR0S21YcDlwLVBWMWZod2J1ejFaa0dnNUw3ajl1amUzdlFBdkxadGZUZVlZMFViMldhNm16Y2g0QUJndmxSRnJKSzc4S2E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Researchers from institutions across France have uncovered solid clinical evidence that supplements of &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; could be an effective treatment for the neurodegenerative condition &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350269"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found in a small number of foods such as fatty fish, eggs, and to some degree mushrooms,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="156202" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; D is typically converted from other compounds in our body on exposure to sunlight. However we get it, the chemical plays an important role in absorbing calcium from the gut, as well as immune functions, cell growth, metabolism, and neuromuscular activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2022.796933/full"&gt;has previously been identified&lt;/a&gt; as a risk factor for MS, a condition in which the body attacks the protective sheaths surrounding its own nerve cells. So researchers conducted a trial with 303 participants diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/cis-and-ms-whats-the-difference"&gt;clinically isolated syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (CIS); a condition that is in some ways similar to, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102262"&gt;often develops&lt;/a&gt; into, MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving just over half of the volunteers a hefty fortnightly dose of vitamin D supplements (cholecalciferol) and the other half a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="156202" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; over the course of two years, the researchers found those in the vitamin group showed fewer lesions on the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disease activity was observed in 60.3 percent of the vitamin D group and 74.1 percent of the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156205" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156205" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DiseaseChart.jpg" alt="Disease chart" class="wp-image-156205 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DiseaseChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DiseaseChart-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/DiseaseChart-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156205" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Vitamin D reduced disease activity in patients. (Thouvenot et al., &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This randomized  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="156202" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; showed that high-dose cholecalciferol monotherapy initiated within 90 days after diagnosis of CIS strongly suggestive of MS reduced disease activity significantly compared with placebo," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831270"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were considered  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="156202" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt; enough to confirm vitamin D could help prevent at least some of the damage done by CIS and MS as the immune system attacks the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also able to characterize the participants who saw the most improvement: those with a severe vitamin D deficiency (as you might expect), those with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"&gt;normal BMI&lt;/a&gt;, and those without any spinal lesions at the start of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Altogether, this suggests that cholecalciferol could represent an inexpensive therapeutic alternative, with low risk of adverse events, after a CIS, especially in populations with limited access to disease-modifying therapies," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831270"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a promising step forward for vitamin D as a potential MS treatment, though unanswered questions remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions were largely based on measures of the damage done to the central nervous system, as detected by  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="156202" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; scans. In terms of symptoms corresponding with MS, there was a much smaller gap between the groups. What's more, the difference in relapse rates between the two groups was found to be non-significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers are also keen to run further tests on how effective this level of vitamin D dosage can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More work also needs to be done in terms of understanding the mechanisms involved here and the potential risks: we know that vitamin D can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vitamin-d-deficiency-can-trigger-autoimmune-conditions-heres-why"&gt;boost the immune system&lt;/a&gt; in certain ways, and that MS is caused by a misfiring immune system, but future studies will be needed to figure out exactly what the relationship is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts continue to find ways to cure or reverse MS, and progress is being made – in terms of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-a-single-genetic-variant-that-makes-ms-more-severe"&gt;identifying risk factors&lt;/a&gt; for the disease, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-of-its-kind-trial-gives-new-hope-for-treating-multiple-sclerosis"&gt;limiting the damage&lt;/a&gt; it does to the body, and understanding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-study-gives-more-evidence-multiple-sclerosis-might-start-with-an-earlier-infection"&gt;how it gets started&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results warrant further investigation, including the potential role of pulse high-dose vitamin D as an add-on therapy," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831270"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831270"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053850/are-beans-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Beans are a versatile and nutritious food&lt;/a&gt; that can play a key role in maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. Loved for their simplicity and packed with health benefits, they are an excellent addition to any balanced diet. Here are four ways beans can help keep your blood sugar levels in check. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; High in Fiber for Steady Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for a blood sugar-friendly carb, look no further than fiber-rich beans. What makes their fiber so beneficial? “Fiber slows the release of the carbs into your bloodstream, which stabilizes your blood sugar,” says &lt;a href="http://www.sarahgoldrd.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sarah Anzlovar, M.S., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian specializing in intuitive eating. And beans are an easy way to rack up lots of this blood sugar-leveling nutrient. For instance, 1 cup of canned black beans provides approximately 17 grams of dietary fiber. That’s more than half the Daily Value.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to fiber, beans boast not one but two kinds, namely soluble fiber and insoluble fiber. But their blood sugar-regulating power comes from their soluble fiber. This fiber forms a gel-like substance in the gut that slows the release of carbs into the bloodstream. That, in turn, prevents sharp spikes or crashes in blood sugar levels, promoting a more stable and gradual energy supply throughout the day. Soluble fiber is so effective that a meta-analysis of 29 studies found that it enhanced multiple measures of blood sugar control and reduced body mass index among individuals with type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Packed with Protein for Satiety &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Beans also contain protein, which plays a role in blood sugar management,” says Anzlovar.  One cup of canned beans offers approximately 15 grams of protein, depending on the variety. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What makes beans’ protein so effective? Protein takes longer to digest and metabolize than carbohydrates. As a result, consuming protein-rich foods like beans can promote satiety and help maintain steady glucose levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There is also strong evidence that a higher dietary protein intake, particularly from plant proteins like beans, supports weight loss and improves glycemic control among people with type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are an excellent choice for blood sugar control due to their low &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/low-glycemic-diet-vs-low-carb-diet-which-is-healthier-8559250" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;glycemic index (GI)&lt;/a&gt;. The glycemic index measures how quickly a particular food raises blood sugar levels. Research has found that eating a diet rich in low-GI foods can improve short-term blood sugar control and reduce weight and body fat in people living with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re wondering what makes beans a low-GI powerhouse, you can thank their combination of fiber and protein. Together, these nutrients slow the breakdown of carbohydrates into glucose, promoting a slow, sustained energy release.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are a rich source of minerals like potassium, copper, manganese and magnesium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While all of these do lots of good things for your body, it’s beans’ magnesium that plays a crucial role in blood sugar control. This mineral is essential for hundreds of biochemical processes in the body, especially blood sugar regulation. It’s so powerful that people who consume more magnesium are less likely to develop diabetes, according to the National Institutes of Health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Just 1 cup of cooked black beans provides roughly 120 milligrams of magnesium. That’s nearly 30% of the Daily Value.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are truly nutritional gems. Thanks to their high fiber, protein and magnesium content and their low glycemic index, they’re our No. 1 underrated carb for better blood sugar control. Whether you’re a fan of chickpeas or black, cannellini or pinto beans, these satisfying pulses aren’t just great for your blood sugar. They’re a delicious addition to any balanced diet. Beyond blood sugar benefits, beans support heart health and metabolism and help keep your digestive system in top shape. Plus, they couldn’t be easier to prepare. Simply dump them into a slow cooker or pressure cooker or pop open a can. Either way, they are as versatile as they are healthy!&lt;br&gt;

						The Hinesburg Police Department has issued a warning about a coyote in the area, after a resident was reportedly attacked on Monday. Police took a report from an individual around 2:30 p.m. on Monday. The individual told police they had been attacked by a coyote on Leavensworth Road that  appeared to have porcupine quills in its mouth. It was not immediately clear if the coyote had rabies. However, Hinesburg police said the game warden had been contacted. The individual who encountered the coyote did not immediately report any injuries to police. Officials said he was seeking medical care as a precaution. The Hinesburg Police Department has asked people not to approach the animal but to call 802-482-3397 if they see it.

NIH trial shows new form of TIL therapy effective against colon, rectum, pancreas, and bile duct tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new form of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy, a form of personalized cancer immunotherapy, dramatically improved the treatment’s effectiveness in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancers, according to results of a clinical trial led by researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The findings, published April 1, 2025 in &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03627-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;offer hope that this therapy could be used to treat a variety of solid tumors, which has so far eluded researchers developing cell-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This form of therapy involves identifying and selecting immune cells (TILs) that are found in the tumor that specifically recognize and attack a patient’s tumor cells. Next, scientists grow those TILs into large quantities in the laboratory before they are finally administered to the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients in the clinical trial, who had a variety of gastrointestinal tumors, also received the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda) to help further boost their immune response. The result was nearly 24% of patients treated with selected TILs plus pembrolizumab had a substantial reduction in the size of their tumors, compared with 7.7% of patients who received selected TILs without pembrolizumab. Patients treated with TILs that had not been selected for anti-tumor activity had no tumor shrinkage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We're seeing the first extension of cellular therapy with TILs into the common solid cancers,” said Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., the study’s lead investigator at NIH’s National Cancer Institute. “We see a little crack in the solid wall of cancer by using cell-based immunotherapy for the common solid cancers, and we think we have ways to open that crack even further.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clinical trial included 91 patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancers—including esophageal, stomach, pancreatic, colon, and rectal cancers—that had worsened despite a median of four prior treatment regimens. In the pilot phase of the trial, 18 patients were treated with TILs that had not been selected for anti-tumor activity, and there were no objective responses (tumor shrinkage of at least 30% is considered an objective response). In the second phase, 39 patients were treated with selected TIL therapy, and three (7.7%) had objective responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the third phase, 34 patients received pembrolizumab immediately before selected TIL therapy to prevent the newly introduced immune cells from becoming inactivated by the patient’s own immune system. This group had the best response, with 8 of 34 (23.5%) patients experiencing an objective response. All 91 patients had also received standard chemotherapy and high-dose interleukin-2 before the TIL therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the trial’s second and third phases, objective responses were seen in multiple types of gastrointestinal cancers, including cancers of the colon, rectum, pancreas, and bile duct. Responses lasted between 8 months and more than 5.8 years in the group that received selected TIL therapy alone, and between 4 months and 3.5 years in the group that received selected TIL therapy and pembrolizumab. Serious side effects occurred in 30% of patients treated with selected TILs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now developing methods to identify TILs that recognize multiple, specific proteins within a tumor, known as neoantigens, to help increase the number of patients who respond to selected TIL therapy with pembrolizumab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TIL therapy, developed in the late 1980s by Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues at NIH, uses an individual’s own TILs to fight their tumor cells. Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first TIL therapy for a solid cancer, lifileucel (Amtagvi), for treating advanced melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new study was co-led by Dr. Rosenberg and NCI investigators Frank J. Lowery, Ph.D., and Stephanie L. Goff, M.D.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;New research says antidepressants taken by millions of Americans are linked to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of the &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1078452?"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, presented at the European Heart Rhythm Association’s 2025 Congress, found that individuals who succumbed to an unexpected death caused by a heart-related issue had a substantially higher rate of antidepressant usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at data from all deaths in Denmark of residents aged 18 to 90 during a single year in 2010. Among the group of just over 6,000 people who experienced sudden cardiac death that year, a disproportionately high number took antidepressants. However, one demographic, ages 18 to 29, did not show a statistically significant link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis further broke down those on antidepressant medication into two buckets: individuals who took the medication for one to five years and those who took it for more than five years. Those in the first group were found to have a 56% higher risk of sudden cardiac death compared to those who were not on the medication. However, those in the second group had a 2.2 times (220%) higher risk than their non-medicated peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the study found a higher risk of cardiac death the longer someone was taking antidepressants, said study co-author Dr. Jasmin Mujkanovic of Rigshospitalet Hjertecentret, Copenhagen, Denmark, &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1078452?"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those exposed for six years or more were at even more increased risk than those exposed for one to five years, when compared with people unexposed to antidepressants in the general population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ad post-ad"&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="172894" zone-alias=""&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mujkanovic theorizes that the increase in risk could be driven by multiple factors, like the drugs themselves causing the adverse effects. She also says the exposure time to antidepressants could be an indicator of a more serious condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, the increase could be influenced by behavioral or lifestyle factors associated with depression, such as delayed healthcare seeking, and poor cardiovascular health,” said Mujkanovic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, more than 20 million adults and 3.7 million kids ages 12 to 17 have depression. Across the country, roughly one in eight people manage the condition using antidepressants, Fortune &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/medication-antidepressants-ssri-risk-cardiac-death/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But then the ring, which tracks sleep, stress and fitness using health metrics, started warning the Virginia-based resident that something in her body was wrong in the beginning of last December. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oura ring app, which is connected to her device, started telling Gooding that she showed “major signs” of something “straining” her body. Her resting heart rate and body temperature were elevated, and her sleep scores were poor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I first got [the warning], I thought maybe I was just fighting some sort of viral illness.

Gooding officially got diagnosed with lymphoma and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oura ring’s warning “definitely validated the way that I was feeling and then made me take it more seriously,” Gooding said.

The ring does not diagnose people with specific conditions, but it does share when biometrics are elevated, changing its data into an urgent red font. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s these red warnings that are causing people to make major health decisions, like finally making a doctor’s appointment that they might otherwise put off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;During COVID in 2020, the NBA even &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/nba-players-could-wear-a-smart-ring-to-track-covid-19-symptoms-as-season-resumes-at-disney-world/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="gave" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eab3bae4b0ff137ab4390b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/nba-players-could-wear-a-smart-ring-to-track-covid-19-symptoms-as-season-resumes-at-disney-world/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;gave&lt;/a&gt; the Oura ring to players and league staff to wear, so that teams could catch early signs of illness and prevent community spread of COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, the Oura smart ring and similar commercial monitoring devices have evolved from trackers that just count steps and calories to becoming people’s health coaches who push people into seeking medical attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Natalie Esparza, her Oura ring’s symptom warnings pushed her to go to the emergency room just in time. In February, when Esparza woke up vomiting and with severe stomach pain, she initially thought she had norovirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then she got the “major signs” of illness alert from her Oura, a message the app didn’t send when she actually had colds or norovirus in the past. Esparza decided to go to the emergency room, where doctors diagnosed her with appendicitis and told the California resident that if she had waited longer, it would have elevated her risk of getting sepsis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it wasn’t for the ring telling me that [major signs alert], I wouldn’t have gone. I probably would have waited a little bit longer to go to the hospital,” Esparza said. “For me personally, [the ring’s alert] was that final push. Like, ‘No, you gotta go.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esparza’s story mirrors the recent story of Paralympic track star Hunter Woodhall who also &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hunterwoodhall/video/7478393506948517166" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="said" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eab3bae4b0ff137ab4390b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.tiktok.com/@hunterwoodhall/video/7478393506948517166" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a TikTok story that his Oura may have “saved” his life, because its “major signs” alert pushed him to go to a doctor and get diagnosed with appendicitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, Woodhall thought his stomach cramps were due to eating cheese and having a lactose intolerance. But because it was the first time in his four years of wearing the ring that he saw that notification, Woodhall took the Oura’s warning seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m so stubborn that I think without what this ring was telling me ... I don’t know if I would have gone to the hospital,” Woodhall said in his TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oura rings can be helpful health coaches. Just know that they can be wrong, too. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you read about the above anecdotes, it might make you think an Oura ring is an all-knowing health god. But temper your expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearable health trackers give users an extensive report of their biometrics, but don’t mistake what it tells you for infallible knowledge. One 2024 &lt;a href="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2024/1/e56972/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="systematic review" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eab3bae4b0ff137ab4390b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2024/1/e56972/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; of 28 studies of wearable health devices’ ability to detect cardiovascular conditions, COVID and physical falls, found that this technology showed the most accuracy in identifying atrial fibrillation and COVID in particular. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise physiologist Andrew Jagim, who has authored &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32734757/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="research" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eab3bae4b0ff137ab4390b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32734757/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on the accuracy of fitness trackers, said wearable devices can provide valuable feedback on how your body is doing “in terms of just overall physiological health.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jagim specifically pointed out a sharp decline in heart rate variability (HRV) ― which Gooding showed in her own stats before her cancer diagnosis ― as a general indication that something is wrong, he said. Heart rate variability tracks fluctuations between heartbeats, so if you suddenly have low heart rate variability, it could be a worrisome sign that your body is becoming less resilient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a sign that “you could be sick, you could be run down, stress, [you did] not get enough sleep, or sometimes all of the above,” Jagim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He likens this sensitive biometrics symptom of HRV to a “‘check engine’ light where something’s wrong with your car. You just don’t exactly know what would be the issue until you get further testing done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Esparza said the Oura ring's warning validated her concern that she should go to the emergency room for her stomach pain. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So don’t panic if you get an alert from your wearable device that something is off. It might be because you had a hard workout the day before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jagim, who uses an Oura, said he has gotten low readiness scores from his ring after two-hour workouts. It’s a reminder that downward trends from an Oura do not necessarily indicate something is severely wrong. “It’s OK for normal fluctuations in our physiology to occur. That’s just how our body responds to stress or intense activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you fly internationally, your HRV score might be low the next day because flying is stressful on the body, Jagim said. At the same time, he said that any alert about heart rate irregularity would be concerning enough for him to follow up with a health professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Jagim said that wearable technology is advancing rapidly enough that within the next five years, he expects devices to integrate their data with electronic health records, so that doctors could also get a heads up about concerning results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart health monitors can be both reassuring and panic-inducing. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these devices are not for everyone. Many people report having to take off their smart devices because the information overload causes them too much anxiety to work out or sleep in peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in Gooding’s own TikTok, people in her comments said that the “major signs” of illness language is too scary to receive. “I got [an Oura] to help with my health anxiety and it made it worse,” one TikToker &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@otikkiyousoofine/video/7478431303315000619" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="replied" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eab3bae4b0ff137ab4390b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.tiktok.com/@otikkiyousoofine/video/7478431303315000619" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;replied&lt;/a&gt; to Gooding’s story. That’s a normal response, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise scientist and sports psychology consultant Nicole Hagobian said the majority of athletes she works with actually get more anxiety from wearable devices than they do benefits, because they fixate on the data and negatively compare their stats with their peers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People need to consider: How do I feel when I get this information on such a regular basis? It’s constant feedback,” Hagobian said. If the answer is “highly stressed,” then these smart trackers may not be for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“For me personally, [the ring’s alert] was that final push. Like, ‘No, you gotta go.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Natalie Esparza&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, too much information about yourself is not reassuring. If you already have a diagnosed health condition, this tracker might make you feel even more stressed. In one 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.033750" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eab3bae4b0ff137ab4390b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.033750" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, patients with prior diagnosis of atrial fibrillation reported higher rates of calling their doctor and symptom management when they used a device that had cardiac monitoring features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hagobian said it’s an example of how wearable devices can cause “hyper-seeking medical attention maybe when [people] don’t need it.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Esparza, what some people see as anxiety-invoking, she sees as a comforting health monitor that validates her worries. Esparza said her Oura’s warnings reassure her than when she shares the app screenshots saying something is wrong, “It’s not just me being a little bit hypochondriac.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before her appendicitis episode, Esparza would only recommend the expensive smart ring that can retail for hundreds of dollars if “you have FSA [flexible spending account] funds and you don’t know what to do.” But now, she wants to buy Ouras for her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

These infections disproportionately impact severely ill patients and those with weakened immune systems, including individuals undergoing cancer chemotherapy, living with HIV, and who have had organ transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Invasive fungal infections threaten the lives of the most vulnerable but countries lack the treatments needed to save lives,” said Dr Yukiko Nakatani, WHO Assistant Director-General for Antimicrobial Resistance &lt;em&gt;ad interim&lt;/em&gt;. “Not only is the pipeline of new antifungal drugs and diagnostics insufficient, there is a void in fungal testing in low- and middle-income countries, even in district hospitals. This diagnostic gap means the cause of people’s suffering remains unknown, making it difficult to get them the right treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungi in the top ‘critical priority’ category of the WHO’s  &lt;a target="_blank" href="/publications/i/item/9789240060241"&gt;fungal priority pathogens list (FPPL)&lt;/a&gt; are deadly, with mortality rates reaching as high as 88%. Advancements in treatments mean that more people are likely to be living with immunocompromised conditions, which also could mean increases in cases of invasive fungal diseases. This is a complex challenge to manage due to inaccessibility of diagnostic tools, limited availability of antifungal medicines, and a slow and complex R&amp;amp;D process for new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Constrained process in developing treatments against deadly fungal infections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO’s &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/380498/9789240105140-eng.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked=""&gt;report on antifungal drugs&lt;/a&gt; highlights that, in the past decade, only four new antifungal drugs have been approved by regulatory authorities in the United States of America, the European Union or China. Currently, nine antifungal medicines are in clinical development to use against the most health-threatening fungi, as detailed in the FPPL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, only three candidates are in phase 3, the final stage of clinical development, meaning few approvals are expected within the next decade. Twenty-two drugs are in preclinical development, an insufficient number to feed a clinical pipeline considering the dropout rates, risks and challenges associated with earlier development stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues with current antifungal treatments include serious side effects, frequent drug-drug interactions, limited dosage forms and the need for prolonged hospital stays. The report highlights the urgent need for safer antifungal medicines, possibly reducing requirements for continuous drug monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antifungal medicines that work against a wide range of severe infections caused by fungal priority pathogens are also needed. Children are particularly underserved with few clinical trials exploring paediatric dosing and age-appropriate formulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends investing in global surveillance, expanding financial incentives for drug discovery and development, funding basic research to help identify new and unexploited targets on fungi for medicines, and investigating treatments that work by enhancing patients’ immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Landscape report of diagnostics for fungal priority pathogens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new  &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/380836/9789240105539-eng.pdf?sequence=1" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked=""&gt;diagnostics report&lt;/a&gt; shows that while commercially available tests exist for fungal priority pathogens, these rely on well-equipped laboratories and trained staff, which means that most people in in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) do not benefit from them. All countries, but particularly LMICs, need faster, more accurate, cheaper and easier testing for a broad range of fungal priority pathogens, including diagnostic tools that can be used at or near point-of-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many challenges with existing antifungal diagnostics; they work only for a limited range of fungi, are insufficiently accurate and take a long time to obtain results. Most of the tests are not well suited to primary and secondary health facilities as certain diagnostics require stable electricity supplies within suitable and equipped laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health workers often have insufficient knowledge about fungal infections as well as the impact of fungi growing more resistant to treatments, resulting in limited ability to perform the testing needed to determine the appropriate treatment. WHO calls for strengthening the global response against invasive fungal diseases and antifungal resistance, and is also developing an implementation blueprint for the FPPL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an ordeal the U.S. had not endured in more than a century.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID has killed more than 7 million people, including more than 1.2 million Americans. As of Feb. 16, 2025, roughly 3,800 Americans were hospitalized due to COVID-19, according to &lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/hospitalizations?n=o"&gt;World Health Organization data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/psc/hospital-respiratory-dashboard.html#anchor_00139"&gt;Centers for Disease Control &lt;/a&gt;data shows that during the week ending March 1, the rate of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations was 1.4 per 100,000 people, significantly lower than the peak of 35.6 per 100,000 people during the 2021-22 season.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet those diagnosed with long COVID are still seeking answers. Experts don’t understand why some people develop life-changing chronic conditions after contracting COVID-19, while others do not.   &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brittanie Goldsby is a St. Louis filmmaker and creative strategist living with lingering complications, including fatigue and shortness of breath, from COVID-19. She underwent stress tests and follow-up visits with a cardiologist to determine the underlying cause of her discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsby caught COVID-19 in the spring of 2022. She assumed she would have a rough few days of flu-like symptoms highlighted by a fever, chills, and body aches. Instead, she started to feel something she wasn’t expecting – fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t just being tired; it was like my body physically couldn’t keep up,” Goldsby said. “Even getting out of bed felt like a challenge.” She said she experienced brain fog and was in a constant daze. “I kept telling myself I’d bounce back in a couple of weeks, but that never really happened.” &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Long COVID can cause more than 200 different symptoms and affect the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, eyes and skin. Sadly, there’s no approved test for it or recommended treatment. Research shows long COVID is more common in middle-aged people, particularly women, and those with weakened immune systems. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks, Goldsby expected to feel like herself again, but instead she still felt exhausted all the time. Walking short distances left her feeling out of breath. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I noticed my heart would start racing for no reason. At first, I thought I was just out of shape from being sick, but then my Apple Watch started sending me alerts that my heart rate was way too high,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsby’s research into her symptoms led her to Reddit, where she read post after post from people describing the same symptoms she was having, and these weird heart rate spikes that doctors didn’t seem to have answers for.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there are diagnostic tools to confirm symptoms of long COVID, there isn’t a test that can diagnose the condition or distinguish it from similar illnesses, the CDC says. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/long-term-effects/living-with-long-covid.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; LONG COVID Survey, 6% of adults in the U.S., or roughly 18 million, are estimated to be living with the damaging aftermath of catching the virus. Doctors are trying to figure out how to treat long COVID and the many areas it impacts the body. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Trying to get answers was frustrating. I went to a doctor expecting some kind of explanation, but instead, I kept hearing things like, ‘It’ll pass’ or ‘It’s probably just anxiety’”, Goldsby said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She pushed for more tests and second opinions. She finally found a doctor who acknowledged what she was going through.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The whole process made me realize how many people are probably struggling with long COVID symptoms and getting brushed off by the medical system, just like I was.” &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to pay attention to her body and advocate for herself when something feels off has been a wake-up call for her, Goldsby said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Trump administration terminated the Health and Human Services Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Long COVID. This could further delay the research of therapies for long COVID. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I believe shedding light on post-COVID heart health could be incredibly valuable for those navigating these issues, especially for our Black and brown communities since we are disproportionately affected,” Goldsby said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

He’s David A. Geier, a  well-known anti-vaccine activist who has reportedly been assigned the job of reviewing the supposed link between vaccination and autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Geier — along with his late father, Mark— had long been &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25874402/increased-risk-for-an-atypical-autism-diagnosis-following-thimerosal-containing-vaccine-exposure-in-the-united-states-a-prospective-longitudinal-case-control-study-in-the-vaccine-safety-datalink-pubmed.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;among the promoters of that very claim&lt;/a&gt;, despite overwhelming evidence from scientifically validated research that there is no such link. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class="quote"&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="quote-body" data-long-quote&gt;It has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p class="quote-attribution"&gt;— Former FDA official Peter Marks, referring to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geier’s assignment to review the purported link was first &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/" target="_blank"&gt;reported by the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; last week. Since then, HHS has not commented on the assignment, either to confirm or deny it. I asked Geier to confirm his assignment, and also to state whether he still believes in the link and if so, what evidence he would cite to establish it. I received no reply from the HHS or Geier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is known, however, is that Geier is an employee of HHS. In &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25874445/geier-directory.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the agency directory&lt;/a&gt; he is listed as a “senior data analyst” with an official HHS email address, which I used to reach him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;ps-newsletter-module class="module newsletter-module" data-id="519" data-module-id="00000195-ee23-d68c-adf7-ff37c0910011"&gt; &lt;div class="module-container"&gt; &lt;p class="module-icon"&gt; &lt;svg class="icon flying-envelope-icon"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-flying-envelope"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Newsletter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="module-title"&gt;Get the latest from Michael Hiltzik&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p class="module-description"&gt;Commentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="module-disclaimer"&gt; You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/ps-newsletter-module&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One other thing should be understood: Given his history with healthcare regulatory agencies, there’s no way he should be permitted anywhere near healthcare policy-making. More on that in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reported accession of Geier isn’t the only indication of how HHS, the programs of which were until recently celebrated as the gold standard of government science, has become a haven of a repugnant anti-science mythmaking and a threat to public health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Peter Marks, the top vaccine scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, announced his resignation in a scathing letter to the acting FDA commissioner, citing “the unprecedented assault on scientific truth” at the agency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Undermining confidence in well established vaccines that have met the high standards for quality, safety, and effectiveness that have been in place for decades at FDA is irresponsible, detrimental to public health, and a clear danger to our nation’s health, safety, and security,” Marks wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stated that he had tried to develop a modus vivendi with Kennedy, but “it has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That brings us back to Geier. He and his father, Mark, collaborated for years on articles claiming a connection between vaccines containing a compound called thimerosal as a preservative and a rise in autism diagnoses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No such connection was ever established. Studies by the Geiers that claimed to have found one were &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25874690/aap-study-fails-to-show-a-connection-between-thimerosal-and-autism.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;widely refuted&lt;/a&gt; and their methodology questioned. At least &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25874691/deer-geier.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;one paper was retracted&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Geiers ran afoul of medical regulators in Maryland, their home state. The Maryland State Board of Physicians &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25874678/md-v-mark-geier.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;revoked Mark Geier’s license to practice medicine&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, after finding that he had been treating young patients with Lupron, a drug commonly prescribed for patients with precocious puberty, and with chelation, a procedure aimed at clearing heavy metals from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those treatments corresponded to a pet theory of the Geiers that &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25874691/deer-geier.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;autism stemmed from the interaction of mercury in thimerosal&lt;/a&gt; with testosterone, and therefore that reducing testosterone would address autism. That theory has never been scientifically validated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mercury scare related to thimerosal, moreover, was something of a red herring. Thimerosal degrades into ethylmercury, which was judged not to be a danger at the level that would come from a vaccine. No study ever established a link between thimerosal and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address public concerns, thimerosal was removed from childhood vaccines in 2001, In any case, as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted, thimerosal was &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html" target="_blank"&gt;never present in the measles/mumps/rubella vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that was most commonly blamed for autism. Nor was it ever used in vaccines against chicken pox, polio or pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Maryland’s revocation of his license, Mark Geier’s medical license was also suspended or revoked by California, Indiana, Virginia, Texas, Missouri, Washington, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, Florida and Kentucky. Geier died March 20, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/dr-mark-geier-tribute-vaccine-safety-autistic-children-advocate/" target="_blank"&gt;an obituary published by Children’s Health Defense&lt;/a&gt;, the anti-vaccine group founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for David Geier, the Maryland medical authorities charged him in 2011 with &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.mbp.state.md.us/BPQAPP/orders/GeierCharge05162011.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;practicing medicine without a license&lt;/a&gt;. He never had held a medical license or attended a medical school, according to the state board. But he met and consulted with an autistic patient and the patient’s mother, who apparently was under the impression that he was a doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the board, David Geier advised that the patient undergo 22 blood tests; the mother balked when lab technicians told her the blood work would require “an insane amount of blood.” The medical board &lt;a class="link" href="https://cdn.centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2021/04/22173813/d_geier_order.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;fined Geier $10,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFK Jr.’s relationship with the Geiers dates back at least to 2005, when he cited their vaccine studies in a  discredited article he wrote titled &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25874721/deadly-immunity.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;“Deadly Immunity,”&lt;/a&gt; an anti-vax screed published by both Salon.com and Rolling Stone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both publications eventually retracted the article. In the piece, Kennedy asserted that “the Geiers have completed six studies that demonstrate a powerful correlation between thimerosal and neurological damage in children.” The correlation proved to be untrue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Geier record in itself would invalidate any “finding” from HHS claiming evidence of a vaccine-autism link. The absence of any such link is as close to settled science as one could hope for, given the volume of evidence against it. That in itself makes the HHS venture a waste of time and money, as well as a danger to public health. Anyway, why would a secretary of Health and Human Services want to put on his payroll someone found to have practiced medicine without a license?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These recent personnel moves at HHS raise the question of whether Kennedy gaslighted Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a physician, when he pledged to Cassidy that he and Cassidy would have what Cassidy described to his colleagues as “an unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship if [RFK Jr.] is confirmed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In explaining his vote to confirm Kennedy on Feb. 4, Cassidy said further, “We will meet or speak multiple times a month. ... Mr. Kennedy has asked for my input into hiring decisions at HHS, beyond Senate-confirmed positions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked Cassidy’s office if Cassidy actually had input into the changes and, if not, if he felt rooked by Kennedy. I haven’t received a reply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of crucial points about the supposed connection between vaccinations and autism. As &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-vaccineautism-link-20140122-story.html"&gt;I reported in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, its original source was &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)11096-0/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;an article published in 1998&lt;/a&gt; in the British medical journal the Lancet by a group led by physician Andrew Wakefield. The study involved 12 children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper has been retracted by the Lancet, 10 of its 12 authors have disavowed its findings, and Wakefield was stripped of his medical license in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British Medical Journal in 2011 documented how &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347" target="_blank"&gt;Wakefield systematically falsified the data&lt;/a&gt; about his subjects to fabricate an association between the vaccine and autism. The goal? To help a group that hoped to profit by suing the vaccine makers. The paper was “&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452" target="_blank"&gt;fatally flawed&lt;/a&gt; both scientifically and ethically,” the BMJ stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these revelations, the Wakefield study has caused no end of problems for public health. It led to a long-term decline in measles vaccinations in Britain and necessitated years of costly studies to analyze and, ultimately, refute its claims. Nevertheless, it remains the father of the vaccine-autism claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One further driver of the supposed vaccine-autism connection is that autism is far more frequently diagnosed today than in the past. Trump himself has cited this supposedly inexplicable trend. In &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" target="_blank"&gt;a Feb. 18 executive order,&lt;/a&gt; he asserted that “autism spectrum disorder now affects 1 in 36 children in the United States — a staggering increase from rates of 1 to 4 out of 10,000 children identified with the condition during the 1980s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that there is no mystery about the rise in autism diagnoses; it’s the result of a reconsideration of the very nature of autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Holden Thorp, the editor in chief of Science, &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25874062/thorp-utism-clean.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;wrote recently&lt;/a&gt;, “The rise in diagnoses is the result of greater awareness, better identification (especially among women and girls) and a broader definition that now includes a range of neurodevelopmental conditions under the umbrella of autism spectrum disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thorp didn’t come to this conclusion casually. He was diagnosed with autism — at the age of 53, seven years ago. The diagnosis prompted him to think about how thinking about autism has changed over the decades, including how the diagnosis no longer carries the stigma that it did during his childhood in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In part that’s because of greater recognition of the diversity of autism itself — “neurodiversity,” as it’s often termed. During his childhood, he wrote, “autism was mostly diagnosed among children who had huge difficulties in daily functioning and needed extensive support. I wasn’t flagged for evaluation or diagnosis, but that might be different today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is becoming plain that Kennedy is turning HHS from a beacon of science-based medicine and public health into a hive of conspiracy theorists and, as Marks wrote, peddlers of “misinformation and lies.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 10:00:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wFBVV95cUxNdUFWVWVYRlRxSVRKZEFaenV6M09xT1BEU3p0NktnQWU5Yy14MThVZWFQSjNfa3lzaldXOHo3RGRYZVpYU2FqNjRwTGk4Z0xFMDZwUFRDdnpBRTFMbmlKNnllT3ZaSkpXVklOWkw3cE5SU0pUcEVId3Foa2tmM0F1WUYzbXR5Q2FEdU0xeW85VWFOblNydlRRNS1pTnlkZDgwSU9WZEs5bURRbGJDWVAyY2JicXFsMl8ycG8yWXljTFoxVHBzSUhFWUt6VHUxYWVxZm1J</guid></item><item><title>The missing women of autism are differently different - Aeon</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPdW15b2hISFk1OUo5dllubm1HdDVFQ3A4UHN0UzFRV0haMzJsd1BfTmZqQTFjdG15NF83LXFZclRCZ1RPMVpmYXN3eXVnZGV6M21BUVJpVEVfT2s1LUhyWF9PV3lwWWZ0YnJoUHAzaUprNjBXTGVOaTBBYzNXRVlXa1Vn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-4ebaf8b7-2 cLLLmT has-dropcap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know that boys are 10 times more likely to be referred for an autism diagnosis than girls? Or that boys who are referred for an autism diagnosis are more than &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-010-0294-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt; as likely to be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27940569/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; as autistic as are girls who have been referred? But this shouldn’t be surprising, as ‘autism is a male problem’, right? Almost every autism-related website, research paper or journal article tells us that autism occurs much more frequently in boys, on average about four times as often, although ratios of 15:1 have sometimes been quoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But suppose you were told that teachers, presented with identical vignettes of hypothetical children, are more &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32488964/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;likely&lt;/a&gt; to identify the child as autistic and in need of support if the child is called ‘Jack’ than if the child is called ‘Chloe’. That girls who are eventually diagnosed as autistic may wait several more years than boys to be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34868805/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;assessed&lt;/a&gt;. That research shows that up to &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;80 per&lt;/span&gt; cent of autistic females may initially receive an inappropriate diagnosis – of social anxiety, or an eating disorder, or borderline personality disorder – before it is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8870038/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recognised&lt;/a&gt; that they are autistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these missing autistic women have found their voices. There is an online forum for late-diagnosed autistic women called the Late Discovered Club. And over the past decade, we’ve seen powerful personal testimonies from women who have been told autism was ‘just for men’. As one mother &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5993544/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘I kept asking to have her evaluated, but with her being a girl, it was even less likely that the paediatrician would refer us. I remember her saying that this is usually a boys’ thing and she is only a little different.’ Now the mountain is a bit easier to climb. All in all, the newly diagnosed women reveal a flaw in our understanding of what autism is, fundamentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hy and how were autistic women sidelined? On one level, a fixed belief in the maleness of autism was so strong that some researchers &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36778135/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hunted&lt;/a&gt; for a ‘female protective effect’ or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12039606/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blamed&lt;/a&gt; autism on an ‘extreme male brain’. On top of that, gendered socialisation has driven autistic women underground, causing them to disguise and internalise their struggles, and depriving them of the help they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with bias in the research itself. A 2021 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8436080/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; found that, in more than 1,400 studies investigating autistic brains, more than &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;30 per&lt;/span&gt; cent studied only males. My own 2024 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11177439/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; reported that, of more than 100 studies on brain models of autism, nearly &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;70 per&lt;/span&gt; cent tested only males (or included just one or two females). Of more than 4,000 autistic participants in these studies, fewer than &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;10 per&lt;/span&gt; cent were female. Early versions of ‘big data sets’, where results were combined to increase their scale and scope, also highlight the male spotlight problem. The first &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE-I), launched in 2012 and containing fMRI brain scan and other data from more than 539 diagnosed individuals, reported only on analyses of 360 males. Scrutiny of the full ABIDE cohort, moreover, revealed that 485 &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(88 per&lt;/span&gt; cent) of the data sets were from males and &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;25 per&lt;/span&gt; cent of the sites invited to participate had excluded females ‘by design’. When it comes to finding an explanation for autism, maleness was the only place many researchers looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did this happen? ‘Science is a bit like the joke about the drunk who is looking under a lamppost for a key that he has lost on the other side of the street, because that’s where the light is,’ Noam Chomsky said back in 1993. And all along, autism researchers have suffered from this ‘streetlight’ effect, falsely shining their light only on males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The film &lt;em&gt;Rain Man&lt;/em&gt; provided an instant stereotype of autism that powerfully influenced public consciousness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet being male has never been part of any autism diagnosis in the formal sense. In 1943, Leo Kanner, one of the so-called ‘fathers of autism’, &lt;a href="https://autismtruths.org/pdf/Autistic%20Disturbances%20of%20Affective%20Contact%20-%20Leo%20Kanner.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; 11 cases of what he called ‘early infantile autism’ – eight were boys, three were girls. But as cases of ‘Kanner’s syndrome’ accumulated, epidemiological surveys reported far greater prevalence in boys. Hans Asperger, writing at the same time as Kanner, made more of the maleness of the condition, referring to ‘an extreme variant of male intelligence’. His seminal &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1992-97284-002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; focused on just four boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the profile of autism was broadened in the 1980s, diagnoses increased so much that there was talk of an epidemic. Yet female diagnoses remained low, with some reporting male-female ratios of just &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;6-7 per&lt;/span&gt; cent. The film &lt;em&gt;Rain Man&lt;/em&gt; (1988), with Dustin Hoffman depicting an autistic savant with both extraordinary skills and bewildering behavioural problems, provided an instant stereotype of autism that powerfully influenced public consciousness of the condition. The picture of autism just didn’t include girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical of self-fulfilling prophecies, the male spotlight was switched on. Committees of diagnosticians painstakingly drew up checklists of commonly occurring signs and symptoms, generating lengthy profiles of ‘typical’ autistic behaviour. So-called ‘gold standard’ tests became near compulsory, not only for a universally accepted &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11055457/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;, but also for inclusion in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-1698-3_894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; studies. And embedded in these assessment schedules was a pre-existing, circular problem. They were all derived from close attention to individuals who had already been diagnosed, the majority of whom were male. Parents might be asked about unusually intense, nerdy ‘boy-type’ interests: historical facts, calendar dates, makes of cars. Clinicians were asked to note ‘loner’ type behaviour: lack of eye contact, failure to engage with others. No tick boxes for more socially normal ‘girl-type’ interests, such as Barbie dolls or ponies, or red flags for apparently normal social exchanges that might, on closer analysis, come across as slightly stilted, even scripted – all hallmarks of autistic girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;t was not until the beginning of the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;21st century&lt;/span&gt; that a wave of powerful personal testimonies from late-diagnosed autistic women eventually raised awareness of this gap in the autism story. Autistic women had found their voice and made clear their omission was not just a matter of not being truly autistic. Books with telling titles such as &lt;em&gt;Odd Girl Out: An Autistic Woman in a Neurotypical World&lt;/em&gt; (2017) by Laura James, or &lt;em&gt;Autism in Heels: The Untold Story of a Female Life on the Spectrum&lt;/em&gt; (2018) by Jennifer Cook O’Toole revealed lifelong struggles as an outsider in a bewildering, highly socialised, world. There were stories of being ostracised, bullied and ‘othered’, of being terrified to be spotted as different, of struggling fruitlessly to understand the invisible rules of social engagement that allowed others to effortlessly understand each other, form friendship groups and be popular. And of constantly being rebuffed when seeking help – ‘girls don’t get autism’, ‘you can’t be autistic, you make eye contact’, and ‘you don’t look autistic’. Stories of parents being told their daughters were ‘just shy’, and their adult selves diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, or generalised anxiety disorder, or depression, or eating disorders – clinicians missing the fundamental diagnosis: autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of all this, research woke up as well, offering a much-needed &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4284309/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt; for sex and gender differences. Scientists began proactively recruiting females into their research cohorts, rather than &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9804357/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;avoiding&lt;/a&gt; them altogether or statistically screening them out as part of the ‘noise’ in their data. They were pressed to design research protocols that would actively identify aspects of autism that varied between males and females. It had become clear that there was a need to move away from the ‘less than’ approach based on a male template, with autistic females described as ‘less’ socially impaired than autistic males, or ‘less’ likely to show repetitive behaviours or highly focused interests than males. Researchers needed to acknowledge that the male spotlight problem in autism research meant that, when it came to autistic females, they had been looking in the wrong place and asking the wrong questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The camouflager might come across as extremely shy. The masquerader might come across as an extravert&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are autistic females really different? The most startling answer concerns the very nature of autism, supposedly signalled by intentional social avoidance and elective isolation. Once there was a closer look at females on the spectrum, a core aspect of &lt;em&gt;their &lt;/em&gt;social behaviour was found to be, conversely, an intense focus on finding ways to &lt;em&gt;ensure&lt;/em&gt; social contact with others, of obsessively trying to find ways to fit in, to belong. Part of this was a powerful fear of being spotted as different, resulting in a lifelong &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5509825/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pattern&lt;/a&gt; of exhaustive and exhausting attempts at camouflage, of devising ways to blend in, of ‘putting on their best normal’. This drive might entail closely watching facial expressions or gestures, mimicking styles of speech, or even generating scripts by listening to others’ verbal social exchanges and repetitively rehearsing them in secret. Interviewed for my new book, one late-diagnosed woman explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I was a young child, I went through a phase where I was terrified of going first in any group activity (and would have meltdowns if I was asked to do so). In hindsight, I was terrified at the prospect of having to demonstrate a behaviour without first being able to observe and copy an ‘acceptable’ model of that behaviour.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their painful struggles might be disguised by creating many different identities or masks that they could hide behind, masks that they hoped would allow them to join the gang, to be accepted as part of a social group. The camouflager might come across as extremely shy or quiet, never putting themselves forward, the girl in the corner, quietly tucking herself away from view. The masquerader, on the other hand, might come across as an extravert, or the performer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I had been the geek, the book lover, the dancer, the academic, the sports fanatic, the food guru, the makeup expert. I had been whoever I needed to be,’ explains Katy Wells in her book &lt;em&gt;The Painted Clown&lt;/em&gt; (2021). ‘Whichever role I had played, had depended on who I had been with. My personas changed so readily. My survival had depended on my ability to adapt, to perform… to mask.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the unfolding story of autism, these behaviours had never served as any kind of red flag, and so these camouflaging chameleons, as they have been dubbed, remained unnoticed and overlooked – hiding in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ld-embed-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://youtube.com/embed/VJHa9xk16Hw" class="ld-embed-block"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ld-embed-caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, these undercover activities did not lead to a happy and successful life, filled with contented membership of multiple social groups. Once clinicians and researchers started to pay attention, they &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/32429817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that camouflaging behaviour was linked to high levels of depression and anxiety, suicidal ideation and self-harm. Personal testimonies describe years of mental health crises, associated with multiple misdiagnoses, inappropriate treatment and medication, an ‘alphabet soup of diagnoses’, until the pieces fell into place and an autism assessment was finally suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ld-embed-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://youtube.com/embed/VzWorS8CdBM" class="ld-embed-block"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ld-embed-caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is now a move to identify camouflaging behaviour, to spot a possible disconnect between someone’s outward appearance of coping and their inner signs of struggle – or even, in a break with traditional autism assessments, of actually asking the people concerned if and how they struggled with social situations. Did they consciously try to maintain eye contact for a certain amount of time? Did they make a note of social gestures and other non-verbal cues and then practise them in front of a mirror? Camouflaging, by definition, is hard to spot, but at least now practitioners and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30361940/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; who might help are looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he new insights have triggered a reset in autism neuroscience research. In the early part of this century, there was an understandable focus on investigating atypical activity in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18771388/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;so-called&lt;/a&gt; social brain. This is a network of brain structures underpinning those skills needed to connect with other people, such as understanding what they might be thinking, getting pleasure from successful social interchanges or finding ways to avoid situations that might lead to social rejection. The early conclusions from such research, when applied to autism, was that it was associated with atypically low levels of activity in the social brain showing, for example, reduced coding of social cues, or an underactive social reward system, with limited signs of affective responsivity to social experiences, negative or positive. This fitted neatly with the accepted view of autistic individuals as asocial loners. But, as we know, these conclusions were based on an era of ‘men-only’ studies. What happened when you started testing women too? Evidence of an &lt;em&gt;over&lt;/em&gt;-active social brain emerged, indicating high levels of anxious self-monitoring in social situations and powerful affective responses to social rejection. A very different picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises the idea that autistic women have been missed not because they generally show milder versions of the fundamental signs of autism, as found in males, or because they are better at hiding such signs, but because &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; autism presents in a different way. Far from avoiding social interaction, it appears they are powerfully driven to seek it. However, in common with the traditional view of autism, they appear to lack the necessary skill-set to successfully achieve such interaction. They have the motivation, but not the means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a different type of autism, but autism nonetheless. Here, there is a powerful drive for social contact, so strong that elaborate (and ultimately damaging) camouflaging schema are developed to disguise any clues that these masqueraders might not fit into the social groups they seek to join. Such camouflaging behaviour makes the underlying struggles harder to spot, but they are there, and the clinical guidelines and diagnostic definitions need to be revised to reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The evidence is that the autism community itself is characterised by high levels of gender variance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/observations/is-it-time-to-give-up-on-a-single-diagnostic-label-for-autism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;suggestion&lt;/a&gt; that we need to move away from the all-embracing concept characterised by the spectrum approach, and re-introduce the notion of subtypes, such as &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Type 1&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Type 2&lt;/span&gt; autism, along the lines of disorders such as diabetes. Should these distinctions be couched in terms of a male autism phenotype and a female autism phenotype, given that most of the ‘Kanners’ are males and most of the ‘chameleons’ are female?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not. There are some females who present with Kanner-type autism, as well as males who present with camouflaging behaviours. We should avoid repeating past mistakes arising from the inaccurate and simplistic grouping of so many aspects of human brains and behaviour into allegedly distinct ‘male’ and ‘female’ categories, especially in the face of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24619651/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that the autism community itself is characterised by high levels of gender variance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have suggested that chameleon-type autism is so different, it does not really fit on the spectrum at all. But that overlooks the core defining feature of autism, a distinctive difficulty with the fundamental human drive to be social, involved with the same brain networks. This can be harnessed as both a theoretical and an applied framework by attempts to understand, and ameliorate if necessary, the many manifestations of autism. Instead of finding a different home for an emerging group who don’t fit the traditional pattern, we must widen our understanding of autism yet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the most important lessons is that this story would not have emerged so effectively if autistic women had not found their voices, and if insightful autism &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9645671/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; had not listened to them. The importance of formally including and understanding ‘lived experience’ in all aspects of autism research is being acknowledged; the autism community is now leading this addition of participatory research when investigating atypical behaviour. Autistic individuals are being included as partners in all aspects of the research process, from design and recruitment through to interpretation and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporating this unique type of expertise could bring equal benefits to other areas of atypical behaviour. Evidence of male bias in autism diagnosis raises a general question about the reliability of psychiatric categories as a whole. The fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s&lt;em&gt; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders &lt;/em&gt;(2013) is several inches thick and runs to approximately 1,000 pages; psychiatric diagnosis is not an exact, unbiased science. This matters. The labels generated by consulting such tomes have real-life consequences for ensuring access to support and understanding. They also have very significant consequences both for research programmes and the development of therapeutic practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is beginning to emerge, for &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11920-017-0791-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, that significant numbers of patients with eating disorders are autistic, and that they form a group that is qualitatively and quantitatively different from eating-disordered patients who are not autistic. So, understanding this overlap, and being able to correctly identify the characteristics of the two groups, should be better enabled by the diagnostic process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, no matter what the presentation, an eventual diagnosis of autism appears to have a powerfully positive impact on the lives and self-image of late-diagnosed females. A common theme in many personal testimonies is the relief at ‘finally finding my tribe’, with exclamations that ‘my life finally made sense’ or ‘I’m not a broken neurotypical. I’m a healthy autistic me!’ So, however flawed the definition of autism currently is, it represents a real and recognisable community to a group for whom ‘belonging’ is the prime driver of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hat does the discovery of autism’s missing women tell us about wider issues of gendered socialisation and its uneven impact on females and males? ‘Many of the moments when my autism caused problems, or at least marked me out as different, were those moments when I had come up against some unspoken law about how a girl or woman should be, and failed to meet it,’ wrote Joanne Limburg in &lt;em&gt;Letters to My Weird Sisters&lt;/em&gt; (2021).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In trying to understand the ‘why’ of camouflaging, we need to discover what forces have driven a considerable number of autistic individuals, many of them women, to spend their developing years struggling to hide their autism. Why should a sub-set of the autistic population be apparently compelled to do everything they can to be part of a social group, even though their efforts result in physical and mental exhaustion and distress, and even render them vulnerable to abusive and damaging relationships?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it relevant that most of these individuals are female? Are we looking at the playing out of a biological &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7777651/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;script&lt;/a&gt;, genetically and hormonally determined, that drives females more powerfully than males to prioritise social group membership or ‘belongingness’ above many other aspects of psychological wellbeing? Or are we looking at the impact of a culturally determined social training &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21803468/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;regime&lt;/a&gt;, encouraging low-profile compliance and conformity, careful camouflaging of any unusual traits, or compulsive internalising of any socially disruptive traits? Or are these alternatives inextricably entangled? As is often the case when studying human behaviour, sometimes it is the exceptions that can offer insights into so-called neurotypical rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an ironic footnote here. Some critics of neuroscience research into gender differences express &lt;a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/srichard/publications/autism-biomedical-platform-sex-difference-research" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;concern&lt;/a&gt; that focusing solely on biological sex as the source of such differences might support negative sexist stereotyping. On the other side of the coin, the alleged ‘maleness’ of autism is often cited as proof that there are indeed irrefutable (and unchallengeable) differences between the brains of women and the brains of men, so biological sex must be the source of such differences. The first group diminishes the concept of sex differences in the brain. The second group embraces the maleness of a brain-based condition such as autism as proof that the ‘female brain’ and the ‘male brain’ are real. At the nexus of these debates is autism’s male spotlight, which has cast a long shadow on our culture and consumed so much light we’ve been unable to fully focus on the whole picture of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Their autism may itself be disguised by other conditions such as self-harm or eating disorders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, finally, the ‘lost girls’ thread goes back further than we thought. It has emerged that the so-called fathers of autism were actually trumped by a Russian female psychiatrist, Grunya Sukhareva, who published finely detailed descriptions of autistic children in the 1920s. She quite explicitly drew comparisons between boys with autism and girls with autism. Her work was broadly overlooked until just &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00787-021-01875-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;two years ago&lt;/a&gt;. Yet another ‘missing woman’!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know that autistic women have been missing from autism headcounts because no-one was looking for them (the male spotlight problem) and because they were in disguise (the camouflaging problem). What next? How can we ensure that no-one goes missing again, and help these newer members of the autism community when they realise who &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;they are?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must challenge the gatekeepers, such as the teachers who believe ‘only boys have autism’, the clinicians who think ‘girls don’t get autism’, the diagnosticians who set up boy-based templates for defining autistic behaviour, the researchers who assume that their men-only findings will suffice as explanations for autism as a whole. We must raise awareness that ‘autism is not just for males anymore’ and that the ‘white, nerdy, male’ stereotypes of autism (both professional and popular) are just a subtype of a much larger group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism professionals and support groups need to be aware that the lived experiences of chameleon-type autists are different from those of the Kanner group. Their obsessive need to belong at any cost makes them especially vulnerable to the type of bullying that is based on social ostracism and to abusive relationships. Their autism may itself be disguised by other conditions such as self-harm or eating disorders, which clinicians should be aware of. Therapeutic support must be geared to help the camouflagers and masqueraders, &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the psychologist Damian Milton has &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09687599.2012.710008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a double empathy problem, the mutual misunderstanding between autistic and neurotypical individuals. The bewilderment experienced by autistic individuals in the social world of neurotypicals is matched by neurotypical lack of awareness of what it is like to experience the world so differently and how hard it can be to understand the social rules of engagement that govern successful and rewarding interactions with each other. Efforts to increase neurotypical understanding of autism now need to embrace autistic sisters as well as brothers for a broader, more nuanced view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have explored the many reasons why girls and women have been missing in the history of autism, and why it matters. We have found our way behind their masks and spotted their differently different autistic behaviour. We have finally welcomed them into our scanners and mapped their differently different brains. Hopefully, we can now make the world a better place for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 10:00:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPdW15b2hISFk1OUo5dllubm1HdDVFQ3A4UHN0UzFRV0haMzJsd1BfTmZqQTFjdG15NF83LXFZclRCZ1RPMVpmYXN3eXVnZGV6M21BUVJpVEVfT2s1LUhyWF9PV3lwWWZ0YnJoUHAzaUprNjBXTGVOaTBBYzNXRVlXa1Vn</guid></item><item><title>Yes, CDC calls the fungus an ‘urgent’ threat.

It is more likely to impact the elderly and people who already are ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have certainly seen it,” said Wu, chief epidemiologist and system director for infectious diseases at &lt;a href="https://hartfordhealthcare.org/"&gt;Hartford HealthCare&lt;/a&gt;, noting that an infection with the fungus “is very dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p0320-cauris.html"&gt;The Los Angeles Times reported last week that the Georgia Department of Public Health recently reported a surge in cases in health care facilities, and a recent study found an alarming rate of spread in Florida hospitals.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tqegJJLPXr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2025/03/27/candida-auris-fungus-cdc/"&gt;Deadly, drug-resistant fungus CDC calls ‘urgent threat’ is spreading in hospitals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as stories circulate about the potentially deadly fungus spread in hospitals and senior care facilities across the country, Wu said it is important that people understand that this organism is present in many places and it is not making people sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it causes infection, that is when we start to worry,” Wu said. If it’s spread in a hospital setting or nursing home, that would be a problem, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest concern is that it is transmissible and can develop resistance to anti-fungal medication very quickly,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But hospitals in Connecticut are well aware of this, watch for signs of infections in patients and are in regular contact with the &lt;a href="https://portal.ct.gov/dph/epidemiology-and-emerging-infections/candida_auris"&gt;state Department of Health,&lt;/a&gt; which also is knowledgeable and prepared, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DPH notes that it collaborates with the &lt;a href="https://portal.ct.gov/dph/laboratory/laboratory-home/katherine-a-kelley-state-public-health-laboratory"&gt;Katherine A. Kelley State Public Health Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antimicrobial-resistance-laboratory-networks/php/about/domestic.html"&gt;CDC Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Networ&lt;/a&gt;k to “provide Connecticut health care facilities with rapid and accurate identification of Candida auris and appropriate infection control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I will give credit to the state,” Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu, as does the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris/index.html?2023=All%20Years"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, said hospitals and nursing homes use early case detection techniques, patient screening, and strict compliance with infection prevention and control practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are prepared for it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state Department of Health&lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2019/04/09/health-officials-connecticut-patient-with-dangerous-drug-resistant-fungus-is-better/"&gt; investigated Connecticut’s first case of Candida auris in June 2017&lt;/a&gt; in an acute care hospital. The person who contracted it may have picked it up in another county, &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2019/04/09/health-officials-connecticut-patient-with-dangerous-drug-resistant-fungus-is-better/"&gt;health department officials said in 2019. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu said hospitals are able to identify people who may be at risk by asking questions about travel and length of travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We get alerted and look for it,” he said, and if needed, patients can be placed in isolation while tests are done. “We try to be preventative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu said candida auris can be on surfaces and can be spread through fecal matter, but is not spread in an airborne way. Sanitation is crucial, he said, and part of this is “good hand hygiene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC noted that candida auris can cause “infection in different parts of the body like the blood, wounds, and ears” and that symptoms “depend on the location and severity of infection. Symptoms may be similar to symptoms of infections caused by bacteria like fever or chills,” but there is “not a common set of symptoms specific for C. auris infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu said he is concerned about cuts at the federal level when it comes to agencies dealing with health, as, if there is a “lack of flow of information we are going to be handcuffed.”  He said even the state DPH gets a lot of information from the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TYo88JM6LX"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2025/03/13/five-years-later-pandemic-response-fears-return/"&gt;Five years ago, COVID gripped the world in fear. Now scientists, doctors warn Trump’s policies are weakening public health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That flow of information is very important,” Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu has previously expressed concern about the spread of misinformation when it comes to health care issues,&lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2025/03/28/texas-measles-outbreak-jumps-to-400-cases-including-more-cases-in-northeast-texas/"&gt; including about vaccinations.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu said the same concern applies to the withdrawal of the United States from the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, “as then we are not getting information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/"&gt;White House order about the WHO withdrawal&lt;/a&gt; says the Secretary of State and the director of the Office of Management and Budget must “identify credible and transparent United States and international partners to assume necessary activities previously undertaken by the WHO.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu said he does not think Connecticut residents should be alarmed about the candida fungus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They should not be fearful, but they should be very respectful,” he said, noting again the importance of good hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu has recently noted his concern about the recent &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2025/03/14/measles-cases/"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; cases and death that have occurred in the nation, which he said were preventable. He added that he sees mistrust in science and &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2025/03/14/rfk-jr-s-first-month-as-health-secretary-touting-french-fries-and-casting-doubts-on-vaccines/"&gt;mistrust in vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, “is like driving without a seatbelt,” and he supports vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;

And constant soreness is not something to strive for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“A common misconception is that soreness means a workout was effective,” said Cedric Bryant, an exercise physiologist and the president and chief executive of the American Council on Exercise. “While some soreness is normal, it is not a requirement for muscle growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-3a8eefd"&gt;What Sore Muscles Mean&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When your muscles feel sore a day or two after exercise, it’s typically because of microscopic tears in your muscle fibers that can &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/well/move/inflammation-exercise.html" title=""&gt;lead to inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and pain, said Laura Richardson, an exercise physiologist at the University of Michigan School of Kinesiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As your muscles repair during the days afterward, the pain dissipates, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Muscles also often grow stronger after soreness, but that discomfort is certainly not required for muscle growth, Dr. Bryant added. Many athletes do not get sore after workouts, even when they are continuing to improve their fitness and build muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“This does not mean the workout was ineffective,” Dr. Bryant said. It is usually a sign that their muscles have adapted to a regular training routine and have become “more efficient at handling the workload,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Putting underpants on with bare feet could put millions at risk of a gruesome and embarrassing groin infection, a top doctor has warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So-called 'crotch rot' is caused by the fungus, tinea corporis, commonly known as ringworm, and appears as scaly, itchy and sometimes red skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And according to Dr Samuel Choudhury, a GP who specialises in skincare, the infection often spreads to the genital area via the feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a video shared to his 450,000 &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-e41f1720-0ece-11f0-8576-2bac6e02ea97"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; followers Dr Choudhury warned that foot ringworm is incredibly common — affecting around 70 per cent of people 'at least once in their life'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And studies show that around 20 per cent will, at some point, suffer the same infection in the groin area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Choudhury explained that underwear comes into contact with the fungal spores on the feet, and carries them up to the groin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So this is what you need to do to avoid jock itch [crotch infection],' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Not wearing underwear is not the solution, but wearing your socks first is. It acts as a barrier so you contain the infection.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that those who suffer persistent jock itch should 'think about' the state of their feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-1fa2a840-0ed2-11f0-8576-2bac6e02ea97" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; guidance echoes Dr Choudhury's warnings, advising that fungal groin infeections are usually caused by reinfection from other parts of the body, like hands or feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have shown that young men are the most likely to suffer, as well as those who work in &lt;span&gt;high temperature environments, wear tight fitting clothing or are obese.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These fungi naturally live on your skin and typically don't cause problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, wearing sweat-soaked clothes after exercising can lead to prolonged exposure to moisture, allowing the fungi to multiply quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jock itch, sometimes referred to as 'crotch rot' is contagious for as long as the fungal spores are living on the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These spores can even live on surfaces like bedding and towels for over a year if they aren't washed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Advice to treat the infection includes washing affected skin areas daily, making sure to dry thoroughly as well as avoiding scratching and washing clothes and bedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If symptoms don't improve with home treatments, experts advise contacting the doctor for advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors will typically prescribe an anti- fungal cream such as hydrocortisone and/or an oral anti-fungal if the infection gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower back pain is a global epidemic with 619 million people suffering from this condition worldwide, according to an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(23)00133-9/fulltext" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(23)00133-9/fulltext" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt; journal.

"Personally, I prefer a standing forward fold because that is what feels best in my body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel that a forward fold offers a complete reset of my spine, and also helps to relax my neck and shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After a long day of sitting, and working at my desk, when I enter a forward fold, I feel relief through my backside body. I can feel the space between my vertebrae become more open."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-movement"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the movement &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood recommends completing three to five repetitions of standing forward fold and holding the stretch for 30 seconds. The instructor advises doing the move when you wake up, after you’ve finished work, and before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can do this every day of the week," Wood explains. "There is no rule limiting how many forward folds one does, just be mindful with movement and breath."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-58XJRzaVDUXDpMv3LRscG5" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-58XJRzaVDUXDpMv3LRscG5 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repetitions:&lt;/strong&gt; 3-5 &lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 seconds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand in a mountain pose with your feet hip-width apart, arms by your side and your &lt;a href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core"&gt;core engaged&lt;/a&gt;. Ground down through your feet to lengthen your spine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inhale and raise your arms overhead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exhale, fold forward by hinging at the hips. Maintain a small bend your knees and lead the movement with your chest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relax your hands and head towards the ground.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Draw your navel in and up and engage your quads (front thigh muscles) and hip flexors (at the top of your legs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move deeper into the stretch with every breath. Inhale, find length in your spine, exhale and fold deeper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modifications: &lt;/strong&gt;If your hands don’t reach the ground, place your hands on yoga blocks, or on your shins or hips. You may wish to bend your knees and bring your hands to your thighs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-benefits-of-doing-standing-forward-fold"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The benefits of doing standing forward fold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing forward fold, or Uttanasana as it’s known in Sanskrit, is one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/yoga-stretches-for-beginners" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/yoga-stretches-for-beginners"&gt;best yoga poses for beginners&lt;/a&gt; for flexibility. But that’s not the only benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anytime you are folding forward in a yoga pose, there is a calming effect on the nervous system," Wood explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A standing forward fold also strengthens the thighs and knees, while stretching the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;hamstrings, calves, hips, glutes, shoulders, and soles of feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Folding forward also helps improve digestion. When the belly is folding over the thighs there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;is gentle stimulation to the digestive system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood says forward fold can also help the spine stay strong and supple, supporting better posture.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A new study has identified a protein that appears to be essential for hair growth and hair follicle protection. Called MCL‑1, it could potentially be targeted by treatments for certain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-hair-loss-drug-approved-restores-80-of-hair-loss-in-some-alopecia-patients"&gt;kinds of baldness such as alopecia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from the Duke‑NUS Medical School in Singapore and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Australia, researchers found that when MCL-1 production was blocked in mice, the animals lost their hair later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hair follicles go through cycles of quiescence and growth, with MCL-1 playing a critical role in the latter phase. The protein doesn't seem to affect the resting phase or the initial development of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"&gt;hair follicles&lt;/a&gt;, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156731" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156731" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HairChart.jpg" alt="Hair chart" class="wp-image-156731 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HairChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HairChart-611x415.jpg 611w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HairChart-600x407.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156731" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers studied the impact of MCL-1 on hair follicles in mice. (Chin et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Acute MCL‑1 deletion rapidly depletes activated hair follicle  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="156728" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; and completely blocks depilation‑induced hair regeneration in adult mice, while quiescent hair follicle stem cells remain unaffected," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58150-5"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.704547/full"&gt;already known&lt;/a&gt; that MCL-1 played an important role in protecting a number of different kinds of tissue from apoptosis; the programmed death of redundant or damaged cells to keep the body functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to hair, MCL-1 prevents follicle stem cells from being stressed and damaged as they 'reawaken' from rest. Without MCL-1 to protect them, these cells stop functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team was also able to reveal new details on MCL-1's function, identifying ways it suppresses another protein called BAK and how MCL-1 is regulated by a signaling pathway called ERBB. These details could be useful in developing new methods of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-surprise-hair-loss-breakthrough-sugar-gel-triggers-robust-regrowth"&gt;hair loss treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest that ERBB signaling modulates MCL‑1 expression through translational control mechanisms, particularly during periods of heightened apoptosis and regression in the hair cycle," the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58150-5"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was based solely on mice, so while there's good reason to think the same processes are happening on the top of our own heads, the findings will need to be replicated in clinical research on humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also worth bearing in mind that there are several &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-hair-doesn-t-grow-on-wounded-skin-and-how-it-might-help-hair-loss-treatments"&gt;different kinds of alopecia&lt;/a&gt;, all with a variety of contributing causes: if treatments are one day developed that focus on boosting MCL-1, they're not going to work for all types of hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those limitations aside, this one protein's handiwork is a significant revelation concerning hair follicles' ability to grow hair. The findings could also inform future studies into other processes affected by MCL-1, including &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2023.1226289/full"&gt;cancer cell death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study advances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying hair follicle regeneration and offers new insights into how  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="156728" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; survival and tissue regeneration are orchestrated," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58150-5"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings may have broader implications for controlling the survival of stem and progenitor cells in tissue regeneration and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="156728" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; expansion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58150-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/02/26/measles-outbreak-texas-death/"&gt;child in Texas died from measles&lt;/a&gt; in February, marking the first pediatric death since 2003. The last adult death from measles in the U.S. was in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak in Texas &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-new-mexico-vaccine-rfk-d5444b3397ac7c4034e63becc219aa33"&gt;has grown to 400 cases&lt;/a&gt;. Other states with outbreaks — defined as three or more cases — include New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio and Oklahoma. Since February, two unvaccinated people have died from measles-related causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new outbreaks confirm health experts’ fears that the virus will take hold in other U.S. communities with low vaccination rates and that the spread could stretch on for a year. The World Health Organization said this week cases in Mexico are linked to the Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is both extremely contagious and highly preventable with a vaccine, Colorado state epidemiologist Dr. Rachel Herlihy said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MMR vaccine provides excellent protection and helps prevent outbreaks like the one we are seeing globally,” she said. “We urge Coloradans to review their vaccination status and take steps to protect themselves, their families and their communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine may also prevent infection if given within 72 hours of being exposed, according to state officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://myaccount.denverpost.com/dp/preference"&gt;Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get health news sent straight to your inbox.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Experts say many of the estimated million people living with this condition are "ghosts in the system", whose lives are being torn apart by poorly managed extreme suicidal lows or manic, erratic highs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Emma was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in her early 30s, after experiencing a mental health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When she was 32 weeks pregnant, her grandmother died unexpectedly, sending her into a "deep low". "I felt awful, but the perinatal team wouldn't take me on," she says. "They said my symptoms weren't that serious." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When Emma gave birth, the extreme lows of her pregnancy were replaced by an unexpected high. She felt amazing in the days after her baby was born - but she didn't sleep and her behaviour became increasingly erratic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A few weeks later, her mood flipped again. When her baby was three weeks old, Emma took an overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It took a week in hospital for her liver function to return. But even after that, she was in and out of hospital for a year before finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and medicated correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If I had the correct care, and been listened to during my pregnancy or even earlier, I could have avoided taking that overdose - 100%," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It wasn't Emma's first experience of poor mental health - she'd spent her teens seeing doctors and receiving different antidepressants. No one had ever suggested she might have bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Emma was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in her early 30s, after experiencing a mental health crisis&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Experts have told the BBC how most people living with bipolar disorder in the UK are "undertreated, undiagnosed and left to try and survive in a system that has failed them".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The majority who, like Emma, are eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder, are incorrectly prescribed antidepressants initially, which makes their symptoms worse rather than better. Experts also say there is a lack of continuity of care from GPs through to psychiatrists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Their warning comes as data exclusively shared with the BBC suggests the cost of the condition in the UK is now an estimated £9.6bn a year. That equates to more than £300 per taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This breakdown includes NHS costs, such as GP services, psychiatrist appointments and visits to A&amp;amp;E and hospital admissions. It also includes economic costs, such as lost days at work and the need for family and friends to take time off to provide informal care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But it does not include welfare payments for those out of work, or costs for police services dealing with people in crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Highly treatable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This nearly £10bn figure is actually quite conservative," says Prof Judit Simon, from the Medical University of Vienna, who worked with the BBC to generate the number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If this is a government that really wants to try and bring down the welfare bill, then bipolar disorder should be its absolute priority, the target disorder to actually move the dial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The data suggests up to 372,000 people with bipolar disorder are currently out of work and claiming benefits in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For a treatable disease, this number could be slashed if the correct care was on offer, say experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Guy Goodwin, emeritus professor of psychiatry at University of Oxford, says: "If you want to cut the costs of a disease, you need to reduce hospital admissions and emergency care. If you don't focus on cutting hospital admissions then you waste money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP), bipolar disorder is a manageable condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Trudi Seneviratne, registrar at the RCP and a commissioner on the Bipolar Commission, says it is "completely treatable" with a combination of medication, talking therapies and lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"But there are many, many people who are suffering in silence with lower levels of symptoms because there isn't a good clinical care pathway for them in the UK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She says if care for bipolar disorder was fit for purpose, it would cut "the cost to society" as well as reducing "the human suffering this disease unnecessarily causes".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It is this sense of waste - with people who could be leading a good life but aren't - that angers experts most, who say it is a neglected diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Allan Young, from Imperial College, says: "Bipolar is common, complex and costly - but it is so often unrecognised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"People know it is there but somehow people are just not being cared for correctly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Rosie had been dealing with mental health issues since childhood, but it was only after being in crisis that her condition was recognised.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This lack of correct care is what Rosie says resulted in her being arrested at Stansted Airport for jumping the security barriers during a manic episode in her early 20s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I was utterly delusional," she says. Following her arrest, Rosie was taken to A&amp;amp;E and locked in a room. She waited there for more than 12 hours while a bed at a specialist mental health unit was found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Like Emma, Rosie had been dealing with mental health issues since childhood, but it was only after being in crisis that her condition was recognised. This particular period of psychotic mania had been triggered by a relationship breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She was sectioned and hospitalised for three months, after which she finally began finding a combination of medications that worked for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Now 29, Rosie says she still has high and low periods, but adds that she is far more stable and is able to work part time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I was failed," she says. "I'm told my symptoms were a textbook case for bipolar lows and highs – energetic, grandiose language, erratic – but no one even considered this diagnosis for me until I was sectioned."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Costs could be halved &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Maudsley Hospital, in South London, has an intensive specialist care programme for its sickest, most regularly relapsing bipolar patients. The service aims to try and stop patients hitting crisis point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Similar to services offered in other European nations, the hospital provides group sessions for patients and their families. The classes help patients to understand when an episode might be starting and then contact the service once they spot early warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They can then attend an outpatient clinic and adjust medications. The relatively cheap programme has seen re-admission rates to hospital fall by 80% as intervention takes place before a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Young says costs associated with bipolar disorder could be halved with more specialist care programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Undoubtedly, specialist treatment could contribute to getting lots of people back into work. And we know that work is very good for helping people recover from episodes of mental ill health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, many experts say patients still face a postcode lottery about whether they can see a psychiatrist at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Carolyn Chew-Graham, a GP and professor of general practice research at Keele University, says those who are acutely unwell will be picked up quickly by crisis teams but those with "less florid manic episodes" can miss out on referral to specialists for diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"There's a high threshold of referral," Prof Chew Graham says.

In fact, &lt;a href="https://moodle.com/us/news/ai-for-workplace-training-in-america/" rel="nofollow"&gt;2025 research from Moodle&lt;/a&gt; found that 66% of American employees are experiencing burnout, which is exactly why mental health days are so prevalent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet it seems that those outside of this country don't quite understand the need for mental health days. One African man admitted that he fell into that camp. He didn't get why Americans needed to take time away from work to maintain their mental health — until he began working in the U.S. himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The African man working in the U.S. apologized to Americans he made fun of for taking mental health days.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a heartfelt admission, the Zambian man, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bigsam.14_two" rel="nofollow"&gt;known online as "Big Sam,"&lt;/a&gt; apologized to Americans he previously mocked for taking mental health days. He confessed that he used to think Americans complained a lot, but since moving to America and working in the country, he gained a new understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I’ve been asking for some mental health days off," Sam said, laughing. "Like, I need some mental health time off. They were not lying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/burnout-red-flags-job-consuming-life"&gt;4 Burnout Red Flags Your Job Is Dangerously Consuming Your Whole Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;America's 'hustle culture' is often exhausting. &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam quickly discovered that the constant "hustle culture" that American society promotes is unsustainable. Many corporate environments are fast-paced and come with high, often unreasonable, expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a competitive culture prominent in many U.S. workplaces. Employees may find themselves vying for promotions, raises, or opportunities to stand out. This competitive environment can drive high performance, but it also leads to stress and poor mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.osha.gov/workplace-stress" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration reports&lt;/a&gt; that approximately 83% of U.S. workers suffer from work-related stress, with 54% claiming that work stress affects their home life. Moreover, workplace stress has been reported to cause 120,000 deaths in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="player-wrapper-outer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/career/employees-under-30-lose-one-day-work-week-due-mental-health-issues"&gt;Prolonged stress and untreated mental health problems&lt;/a&gt; can lead to serious physical health issues, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and sleep disorders. By taking time for mental health, employees can avoid these long-term health complications, leading to better overall well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/asian-immigrant-defends-americans-stereotype-lazy"&gt;Asian Immigrant In The U.S. Defends Americans From The Stereotype That They Have Life On ‘Easy Mode’ — ‘Americans Are Not Lazy’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When done correctly, mental health days can be incredibly beneficial.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By taking time off in the form of a mental health day, you give your body a chance to recover, re-energize, and restore mental clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/recharge-with-planned-mental-health-day" rel="nofollow"&gt;Writing for the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, Angela Theisen, L.C.S.W., discussed mental health days, defining them as "limited time away from your usual responsibilities with the intention of recharging and rejuvenating your mental health." She added, "It is an intentional act to alleviate distress and poor mood and motivation, while improving attitude, morale, functioning, efficiency, and overall well-being."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theisen further noted that such days have a multitude of benefits, including reducing feelings of burnout, boosting morale, increasing resiliency, reducing mental health crises, and improving physical health.

Or sleeping until noon and then &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/what-is-doomscrolling-how-to-stop"&gt;mindlessly scrolling through social media&lt;/a&gt; all afternoon. These are easy ways to waste away a day but not improve your mental health," Theisen cautioned. "Be intentional about the activities you do during a mental health day to get the full benefits and improve your health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suggested unplugging from social media, spending time outside, getting active, and doing something creative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/career/career-expert-shares-types-people-unlikely-make-it-corporate"&gt;Career Expert Shares The 4 Types Of People Who Are Unlikely To 'Make It' In A Corporate Environment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sylvia Ojeda is an author who has over a decade of experience writing novels and screenplays.

&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking male birth control pill is advancing through clinical trials, marking a major step toward expanding contraceptive options. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy, in collaboration with Columbia University and YourChoice Therapeutics, have developed YCT-529—a hormone-free oral contraceptive designed for men.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional contraceptives that rely on hormonal changes, YCT-529 works by inhibiting sperm production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drug has already completed its first phase of human clinical trials and is now undergoing further safety and efficacy testing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If approved, it could provide an alternative to the limited birth control options like condoms and vasectomies currently available to men. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-breakthrough-findings-from-preclinical-trials"&gt;Breakthrough findings from preclinical trials&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preclinical testing has shown highly promising results for YCT-529. In male mice, the drug prevented pregnancy with 99% effectiveness within just four weeks of use. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In male non-human primates, it significantly reduced sperm counts within two weeks of administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the research demonstrated that YCT-529’s effects are reversible. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Male mice regained fertility within six weeks of stopping the drug, while non-human primates fully recovered sperm production within 10 to 15 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, no side effects were observed in either group, reinforcing its potential as a safe contraceptive option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A safe and effective male pill will provide more options to couples for birth control,” said Gunda Georg, the corresponding author of the study and a professor in the College of Pharmacy where the drug molecule was developed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It will allow a more equitable sharing of responsibility for family planning and provide reproductive autonomy for men.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-progressing-towards-human-clinical-trials"&gt;Progressing towards human clinical trials&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the success of preclinical studies, YCT-529 has entered human clinical trials. The first phase, conducted by YourChoice Therapeutics in 2024, was completed successfully. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drug is now in a second clinical trial, focusing on further evaluating its safety and effectiveness in humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This study laid the groundwork for human clinical trials of YCT-529, which are progressing efficiently,” said Nadja Mannowetz, lead author, chief science officer, and co-founder of YourChoice Therapeutics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With the unintentional pregnancy rate at nearly 50% in the U.S. and globally, we need more contraceptive options, particularly for men.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-expanding-contraceptive-options-for-men"&gt;Expanding contraceptive options for men&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the FDA approving over 20 types of birth control, men currently have only two primary choices—condoms or vasectomies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The introduction of a male contraceptive pill could revolutionize family planning. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By giving men an effective, hormone-free option, couples would have more balanced choices when it comes to &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/science/novel-fertility-drug-improves-pregnancy" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; prevention. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This could reduce the burden placed on &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/health/ai-women-health-gender" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt;, who often bear the primary responsibility for contraception.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a male birth control pill would be particularly beneficial for those who cannot use female hormonal contraceptives due to health conditions or side effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, YCT-529 could change that by providing men with a reliable, reversible, and hormone-free alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With clinical trials moving forward, researchers are optimistic that YCT-529 could soon enter the market. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If successful, it will not only expand birth control options but also promote greater shared responsibility in family planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Interesting Engineering</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 23:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNOHpUcGpSYzVRWjBKR0t5UUQ5cFhWSE5LekFxN2JXc3NnNmJNS3JTUDNWTENfdE5LSXZOaUxScU5UWmFzdHd6OEI5ekxrbC1adlRVU1QwNmxKOEMwUTU4VVc3YkhoUGdNekVJbFBrcGJydVRSODMyMGdob1NmbXNKeHJuZXNMdGItZkE</guid></item><item><title>SS strikes again - Daily Kos</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE9KNjNmUzFCaVk0bUtPLUlhcE55NXlsT1JrbFptb2dvOW1zNldXdGFsWTlLNlBKUGRraTFVUmRFTHJaTFpBVnN2N2JaeEVfd2JzREpZZlBVQ2JmeDFOSkhiR1pDT01rLWFOR3hDM1hzdFJfOVdjUlVr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;My adult daughter gets a whopping $889 a month for SSD. She had to claim disability before ever being able to hold down a job after getting her Masters degree, in European Policies at Bath University, UK. She has a B.S. degree in Poly Sci and Spanish. She wanted to work in Europe at the EU. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daughter’s SSD diagnosis: OCD at 9 years old. Crohn’s disease (25” removed). Gastroparesis — paralyzed stomach. Those two did not allow her to work and we filed for SSD when she was 22. To get her approved at age 22 for SSD it took two years. Two denials and us hiring a lawyer. A judge finally approved her for SSD and she got a little over $700 to live on. She didn’t qualify for food stamps, etc. due to us making too much money at the time of filing and her living with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added diagnosis at later times: &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/postural-tachycardia-syndrome-pots" target="_blank" title=""&gt;POTS&lt;/a&gt; — Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. Sinus Tachycardia. hypermobile Ehler’s Danlos Syndrome (hEDS); a connective tissue disorder. We think the hEDS skipped a generation or two to get to her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is a heritable connective tissue disorder that causes generalized joint hypermobility, joint instability, and chronic pain. hEDS is also associated with a variety of other symptoms and related conditions that affect many different areas of the body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many with hEDS are wheel chair bound but we are lucky that she is mobile and doesn’t need me to care for her in any way — yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She cannot have over $1500 at any time in her bank account or she’s fined. In &lt;strong&gt;May, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;, hubby forgot to pull out some of the funds so that the automatic deposit wouldn’t go over the $1500. Oooops. SS deposited her $860 and for two days she had over $1500 in her account by $27.00. She got a letter in July, 2024 stating that due to being over the amount in her account in May, she would have a deduction for those two months of over $100 from her next couple of SSD payments, to balance out the account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s allowed one car. She sold the one she had and got an EV. (We’re trying to do our part here folks.) SS saw TWO CARS on her account. She had to call twice and give lots of documentation that &lt;u&gt;THEIR deposit&lt;/u&gt; caused the overage and she only had one car. Resolved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every five years she has to prove that she &lt;em&gt;continues to be disabled&lt;/em&gt;. One time, one asshole said she could use her arms so could work. She filed a complaint and, literally, 15 minutes before us driving an hour and a half to the main SS office in Modesto for the appointment, the agent there called and said he approved her SSD. The ups and downs this causes can be very difficult for her to deal with. She will be 40 years old this year and each year we watch her body slowly, very slowly, deteriorate. Many people with an episode with hEDS (she has had one with the sinus tachycardia) has a life expectancy of 45. We shall see.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 74 year old husband is lucky to be able to work part-time, temporary for the City he worked with before. I also work full-time at 73 years old, as a professional long-arm quilter. We still get out PERS through our previous jobs and our social security by not overworking. We have worked hard for our SS and continue to work hard to support our daughter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pay an extra $1800 a month for insurance for our daughter due to her seeing specialists at Stanford. We still pay cash to other medical folks that help her. Counseling, physical therapy, etc. We lay out between $3 — $4000 a month to care of her (car, medical, food, etc.) Due to her hEDS, she had no connective tissue in her left jaw and had to have major jaw surgery. We paid $67,000 out of pocket due to insurance saying it was elective! The misaligned jaw caused migraine headaches, face, jaw, shoulder, neck pain. Plus it had to be done to help her chew FFS. But insurance kept saying it was plastic surgery and elective. Insurance paid for anesthesia, hospital though. Thank you! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can people perpetrate fraud in Social Security? Within two days they know if our daughter has over $1500 in her account! Then…..deduct funds after that until it’s “balanced.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She just got a new letter today. Is it a form letter all SSD folks are getting? It states that she was notified “before” that there was an issue with her account and she was going to be discounted $121 a month. Not why? Not how long? Nothing. There was no notification before except last year and that was resolved. She will be contacting our local SS office, which for now, is still open for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this part of the changes Musk is trying to put through? It’s already hard enough to get SSD for the small amount of support it affords our daughter.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our current situation. The fight to get what we have paid for through our own hard work can sometimes be overwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Folks, we are all going to be impacted by this administration, negatively, in some way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

One ounce (about 2 tablespoons) of chia seeds contains nearly 10 grams fiber and 5 grams protein, plus &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a64303162/study-omega3-fatty-acids-biolgical-age/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3 fatty&lt;/a&gt; acids, per the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170554/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:United States Department of Agriculture.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven't really tried this superfood, now is the time to change that! This ingredient is easy to incorporate into recipes — and a little packs a big nutritional punch. That said, there are a few things to know before you start stirring this seed into anything and everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, the experts in the Good Housekeeping Test Kitchen and Good Housekeeping Institute Nutrition Labs share their top tips for using these seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are chia seeds?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These small, oval-shaped seeds come from the &lt;em&gt;Salvia hispanica &lt;/em&gt;plant, a member of the mint family. Native to Central and South America, these seeds have been cultivated for centuries and today can be found pretty much anywhere in the United States (Trader Joe's, Aldi, Amazon, you name it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chia seeds nutrition (1 ounce, dry), &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170554/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per the;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;per the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170554/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;140 calories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;9g total fat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;12g total carbohydrates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;10g dietary fiber&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;5g protein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the best ways to eat chia seeds?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that when soaked, chia seeds absorb liquid and turn into a gel-like consistency. This will affect the texture of whatever you're stirring chia seeds into — whether that be smoothies, puddings, homemade jams or something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stir it into oatmeal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because such a small amount packs such a nutritional punch, adding a spoonful of chia seeds into something you &lt;em&gt;already &lt;/em&gt;eat on the regular — like oatmeal — is a no-brainer. Food producer &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/254692/tina-martinez/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tina Martinez;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tina Martinez&lt;/a&gt; always stirs 1 tablespoon of chia seeds into her oatmeal before heating in the microwave. “I love the consistency of just having some chia seeds, but not all chia seeds (as is the case of a chia pudding)." Not a fan of hot oatmeal? You can also mix chia seeds into overnight oats as you meal prep a few jars to stash in the fridge for the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Make a chia pudding&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can't talk about what to do with chia seeds without bringing up chia pudding. "Chia pudding is so thick and creamy because of the way the seeds interact and plump up when combined with liquid," explains Chief Food Director &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/11320/kate-merker/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kate Merker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kate Merker&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on what else you add to the equation, this dish can be enjoyed as a breakfast, snack or fun dessert. No matter &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you eat it, know it'll probably help you stay satiated. "I had chia pudding while I was traveling, and it kept me full, so now I make it at home," says Kitchen Appliances Lab Director &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/223025/nicole-papantoniou/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nicole Papantoniou;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nicole Papantoniou&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blend into smoothies &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papantoniou also recommends adding some chia seeds to your smoothie. "Don't add too many, though, because the seeds can change the texture and make the drink jiggly," she warns. You should be good with adding just a tablespoon to your favorite smoothie recipe to start. That's the amount we used in our &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/a38684144/make-ahead-smoothies-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Berry, Chia and Mint Smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Berry, Chia and Mint Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a jam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where chia seeds' ability to absorb liquid and plump up &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;comes into play in the best way possible. Combining chia seeds with muddled berries and maple syrup results in a naturally thickened (quick!) jam — no need for additional pectin or gelatin. "I'll use it when I'm cooking down just plain frozen fruit for a jam," says Deputy Editor &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/226537/sarah-wharton/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sarah Gregory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sarah Gregory&lt;/a&gt;. She then will spread the jam on toast, stir into oatmeal or even layer into a breakfast oat bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Boost your energy bites&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you usually DIY these nutrient-dense snacks to stash in your fridge or freezer, stir some chia seeds into your next batch. Nutrition Director &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/224673/stefani-sassos/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stefani Sassos, M.S., R.D.N., NASM-CPT;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stefani Sassos, M.S., R.D.N., NASM-CPT&lt;/a&gt; always adds chia seeds to her energy bites.

They will contribute crunch to whatever you sprinkle 'em on. That can include yogurt or smoothie bowls, with a handful of granola, as well as salads. Papantoniou loves to sprinkle some on top of bananas with peanut butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How should you store chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the recommendation is to store chia seeds in a cool, dark place (read: your pantry), only half of the food team stores them there. The other half keeps theirs in the freezer, which can help prolong their shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you eat &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;many chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, yes. "Chia seeds are little nutritional powerhouses, but you can get too much of a good thing. Eating them in large amounts may lead to digestive distress since they are very high in fiber," says Sassos. Be sure to drink plenty of water to help the fiber properly digest, and introduce them gradually into your diet. This really applies to any high-fiber food, since you need to allow your digestive system some time to adjust to the higher fiber content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 23:14:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9mS0RlTlZHREt3OFNhX3BYU0tEVkNaT2hoeUxrc0NmYm8zRU5NT3d6NndoWXBOM1FEOW9BTXZMQ01IRjFuX0U3TEF6M1VwWno4emI5ejAxTmJFb2JQSTF5ekJSdTdveUk</guid></item><item><title>This Woman Had No Idea She Had A Life-Threatening Health Issue Until A Preventative MRI Screening - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPazlaZzc3ZENPX1ZuRzBZdjZ4bkdfOWZLbG83SmduVVVKUGJsS3JyaUl2R1V0VGg0RjZNU3BtR3RtMUltdThaS1B0cXowNDFWSkRvRTJwNk1vd0hWckZIazd2bXpMenMwN0tsZmdpZ2VoREgxVnNBTnk0by11MTAyNnh5anUxMVlCOWFRUw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;Prenuvo's scans are elective, meaning they are not covered by insurance. However, Prenuvo &lt;a href="https://prenuvo.com/pricing" target="_blank"&gt;said on its website&lt;/a&gt; some people "have been able to get full or partial reimbursement." Prices can range anywhere from $999 for a Torso Scan to $2,499 for a Whole Body Scan to $4,499 for an Enhanced Screening in New York City (some of the prices are dependent on location).&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the US, MRIs can cost, on average, $400 to $12,000, &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/health-topic/diagnostics/how-much-does-an-mri-cost" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to GoodRx. Some portion of MRIs could be covered by insurance, but that depends on the type of insurance, whether or not the MRI provider is in or out-of-network, if there are additional medications needed with the procedure, and if it's considered medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

Then she shook her head and added, "No."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarah received her results four days later. "The only issue with how I got the results is that they came at 8:30 p.m., and I had nobody to call," she said. "They schedule your nurse practitioner phone call within, like, 24–48 hours...so I just went into a full-blown panic attack when I got my results and ended up in the emergency room because I needed a doctor to tell me what this meant."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt; @sarblackburn / Via &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarblackburn/video/7463201078146993454" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tiktok.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;tiktok.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A spokesperson from Prenuvo told BuzzFeed, "At Prenuvo, patient care and wellbeing are our highest priorities.

It can be life-threatening, especially if you're pregnant. Like other aneurysms, a splenic artery aneurysm is dangerous because it can rupture (break open) or dissect (tear).

You may need to take preventive antibiotics or get additional vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"So yeah. That is how my health anxiety started," Sarah continued. "It was a really dark and hard two months where I was spiraling and freaking out and seeing a lot of doctors, and pretty much treating my body like glass because I had no idea about this, and literally felt like a ticking time bomb was found inside my body."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarah later got a CT scan and discovered there were actually not one, but &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; splenic aneurysms inside her splenic artery. "So, anyways...now I am getting my spleen removed, and I will be starting the journey of living life without a spleen, which I think is going to be okay and it's going to be better than having to live in fear of having a ruptured aneurysm — but not what I was expecting," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarah said friends have asked her whether she regrets getting the scan or not. "It changes often," she said. "But I feel grateful. I'm happy that I know about this and had the chance to decide what I wanted to do moving forward. But I've also had people say, 'Oh, I have health anxiety, I want to go do this.'"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"For the people that already have existing health anxiety, I truly don't know if I can recommend it because I was just like a normal anxious girlie before this, and now, I'm a normal anxious girlie with debilitating health anxiety that I'm trying to overcome," she continued. "But I will say, I'm pretty proud of myself for the way that I overcame this. And...yeah. Two months ago was a very different story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some commenters in the medical field told Sarah just how lucky she was to have found this condition early. "My jaw dropped reading splenic aneurysm.

"I hope one day this can be covered by insurance (or better yet covered by free healthcare) so that everyone can have preventative care," someone said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another said, "I don't understand why every insurance cannot provide 1 full body scan to every person. Just once a year. ... It would be so amazing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And finally, "Our insurance should cover regular scans," said another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prenuvo's scans are elective, meaning they are not covered by insurance.

&lt;p&gt;The health department is investigating after an active tuberculosis case was identified at a Waukegan High School campus, which is prompting enhanced cleaning and precautions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waukegan Community Unit School District 60 Superintendent Theresa Plascencia sent a letter to part of the Waukegan High School Brookside campus about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plascencia said an &lt;span&gt;active tuberculosis case has been identified within the Brookside campus school. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The district said they are working closely with the Lake County Health Department to follow all recommended protocols to “ensure the safety and well-being” of students and staff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students and staff identified as close contacts have already been notified with recommended actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To respect their privacy, we will not be sharing any additional details,” Plascencia said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high school is undergoing recommended cleaning procedures as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School operations continued as usual on Monday with continued cleaning and COVID-era air filtration enhancements in place, Plascencia said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;is spread through the air from one person to another. The disease germs are emitted into the air when a person with active &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;disease of the lungs or throat coughs, speaks or sings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with active &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;disease are most likely to spread &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;germs to people they spend time with every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;can make a person very ill, Plascencia said in the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If not treated, it can lead to serious health complications. Only people with active TB disease can spread the germ to others. Those with ‘latent’ TB have the germ in the body but cannot spread it to others. Both active and latent TB are treatable,” Plascencia said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who experiences symptoms associated with tuberculosis, such as a persistent cough lasting three weeks or longer, coughing up blood, pain with breathing or coughing, chest pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss, fever, chills or night sweats, is asked to contact their healthcare provider or the Lake County Health Department &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;clinic at 847-377-8700.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school district is hosting a virtual town hall at 6 p.m. on Tuesday with the Lake County Health Department to answer questions students and parents have.&lt;/p&gt;

Your red eyes and runny noses don’t deceive you — seasonal allergies are getting worse, a miserable reality for nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220126.htm"&gt;one in three US adults and one in four children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Why? Sneezing and sniffles are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epub/10.1073/pnas.2013284118"&gt;sirens of climate change&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, because of warming, pollen is now a nearly year-round menace in some parts of the US. Pollen, the main seasonal allergy trigger, is emerging earlier in the year, in higher concentrations, and lasting longer year after year. “In the springtime, the first pollen allergens are from trees, and that is starting 20 days earlier than it did 30 years ago,” said &lt;a href="https://aafa.org/about-aafa/senior-staff/"&gt;Kenneth Mendez&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of AAFA. Rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are directly inducing plants to produce more pollen while extending the temperature conditions that trigger pollen production in plants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We hear all the time, ‘I’ve never had allergies before and now I suddenly feel like I have allergies,’ or ‘I feel like my allergies are getting a lot worse’ and that’s because the allergic load is that much higher because of climate change,” Mendez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For most people, seasonal allergies are an unpleasant nuisance. But with millions feeling &lt;em&gt;blergh&lt;/em&gt; at the same time, it adds up to a huge economic burden in lost productivity. Asthma, allergic rhinitis — the condition you probably know of as hay fever — and related allergy conditions &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14737167.2020.1819793#d1e333"&gt;cost the economy billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; each year in lost work days, medications, and doctor’s visits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are also people for whom pollen is a more serious problem and can lead to dangerous complications or exacerbate other health issues. One study found that tree pollen allergies lead to &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018GH000153"&gt;25,000 to 50,000 emergency room visits&lt;/a&gt; per year, two-thirds from people under the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over time, as pollen counts increase, more people with a higher sensitivity threshold are finding out the hard way that these tiny grains are a hazard. Other people are also finding out that doors and windows can’t protect them as some of the tiniest pollen grains seep in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“If the trendlines continue, I think more people are going to feel miserable from allergies,” Mendez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-we-keep-making-allergies-worse-for-ourselves" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How we keep making allergies worse for ourselves&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The problem for allergy sufferers is that their body’s defense mechanisms sometimes overreact to something benign. Usually, it leads to mild, easily treatable symptoms. But allergens can also trigger more serious complications like &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21461-allergic-asthma"&gt;asthma attacks&lt;/a&gt;, causing wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. In rare cases, they &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000844.htm"&gt;can lead to anaphylaxis&lt;/a&gt;, a whole-body reaction where the airways can swell shut and blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The vast majority of pollen allergies are more annoying than dangerous, but seasonal pollen is so ubiquitous that it’s almost impossible to avoid, sneaking indoors through vents, window seals, on clothing, and in pet fur. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some people are more sensitive than others, but the relentless, growing exposure can add up to misery even for those with mild allergies. Pollen grains range in size from &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.1191"&gt;100 down to less than 10 microns&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to penetrate deep into the lungs and irritate airways. Many types of plants release pollen as part of their reproductive cycle. Generally, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6934246/"&gt;trees spread pollen in the spring&lt;/a&gt;, grasses over the summer, and ragweed in the autumn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Airborne cloud of pine pollen from male pine cones in Arizona.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Wild Horizons/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;However, the historical pollen timing patterns have already shifted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Tree pollen is wafting off of branches earlier in the season almost every year. Some grass species have seen their &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28764-0"&gt;pollen release days delayed by almost a month&lt;/a&gt; while their overall season has grown longer. As a result, grass pollen increasingly overlaps with the &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-ragweed-pollen-season"&gt;ragweed pollen season&lt;/a&gt;, which itself has been extended by more than three weeks in some parts of the country since 1995. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are two key mechanisms driving this trend, both induced by humanity’s appetite for fossil fuels. Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from burning coal, oil, and natural gas &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7346998/"&gt;directly induce many plant species to produce more pollen&lt;/a&gt;. Carbon dioxide can make plants grow bigger and faster, and &lt;a href="https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/greenhouse-carbon-dioxide-supplementation.html"&gt;produce more flowers&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to more pollen. More pollen leads to more seeds, which means even more plants spraying pollen the next season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are also warming the planet and changing the climate. In general, that means &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-seasonal-temperature"&gt;warmer, shorter winters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northeast/topic/climate-warming-brings-earlier-spring"&gt;earlier springs&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to longer growing seasons for plants. These trends will continue as global average temperatures go up, making allergies a significant public health burden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some parts of the country, such as Texas, are on track to see &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/allergy/articles/10.3389/falgy.2022.959594/full"&gt;pollen counts almost double&lt;/a&gt; by 2050 compared to 2000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="its-not-just-pollen-you-have-to-worry-about" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;It’s not just pollen you have to worry about&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For many people, allergies are an added complication on top of other health and environmental conditions. Air pollution from ozone, particulates, sulfur, and nitrogen compounds can cause their own breathing problems, but when they intersect with allergies, they can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8638356/"&gt;make symptoms even worse&lt;/a&gt;. Pollution from roads can make pollen from nearby plants &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2012.02846.x"&gt;more potent at triggering allergic reactions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10176314/"&gt;Smoke from wildfires&lt;/a&gt; can also exacerbate allergies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Cities may not offer much refuge. Changes to the landscape like urbanization can create a &lt;a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2512"&gt;more favorable habitat&lt;/a&gt; for plants like ragweed. City centers also tend to warm up faster than their rural surroundings and experience higher concentrations of air pollutants, compounding the effects of allergies. These factors are especially potent in low-income and underserved communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Pollen isn’t the only allergen changing with the climate either. Rising temperatures and precipitation in some areas are &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92178-z"&gt;increasing the number and duration of allergenic mold spores&lt;/a&gt;. Extreme weather further worsens the problem, as the damage and destruction create conditions for more mold. That was evident in New Orleans last year as storms like &lt;a href="http://v"&gt;Hurricane Francine&lt;/a&gt; soaked the city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“When these storms come through, they create so much damage over the landscape of the state. Some communities have resources to immediately move in and repair roofs and patch windows, and then we have a lot of folks that simply don’t have those resources. With leaking roofs, you have mold growth indoors,” said &lt;a href="https://www.ochsner.org/doctors/john-clifford-carlson"&gt;John Carlson&lt;/a&gt;, who leads the high-risk allergy division at the Ochsner health system in New Orleans. “Because it’s so warm here, we can grow mold year round as long as there’s moisture.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;High winds from storms can also whip up dust, which can then trigger asthma. Additionally, there’s a phenomenon called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6512777/"&gt;thunderstorm asthma&lt;/a&gt;, where the weather conditions can &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/can-a-thunderstorm-trigger-asthma"&gt;rupture pollen grains&lt;/a&gt; into smaller, more allergenic fragments, triggering asthma attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s not clear whether the overall number of people with seasonal allergies is increasing. The US may be approaching a plateau in the number of people who are susceptible to pollen, Carlson said. At the same time, there are other conditions that can present with allergy-like symptoms, and at high enough concentrations, even people without allergies will wheeze. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“In New Orleans, we have a ton of oak pollen — I mean, just so much oak pollen in the air — and you commonly have a lot of people who don’t have oak pollen allergy nevertheless with itchy eyes and the sneezing from just the irritant effect of the particles,” Carlson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The good news is that there are ways to contain the worst effects of seasonal allergies. For people with a history of bothersome seasonal allergies, seeing an allergist and finding out what their specific triggers are and what medicines work is key. It may make sense to start taking medications like nose sprays or over-the-counter allergy drugs before pollen ramps up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We generally say to have your medications in your system close to two weeks ahead of time because it takes some time to build up,” Mendez said. For people who don’t know if they have allergies but are concerned about the threat, pay attention to your symptoms and see an allergist if you do start to experience irritated eyes and airways. There are also more aggressive interventions for people with severe allergies who don’t respond to other medicines like desensitization therapy, also known as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/25194-allergy-shots"&gt;allergy shots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some of the same measures for avoiding air pollution also work for pollen. Pay attention to pollen forecasts in your local area. Avoid being outside and close doors and windows during high pollen release times, particularly in the morning. Leave your coat and shoes outside or locked away before you settle down at home. Wipe down your dog after a walk. Use a HEPA air filter in your living spaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;Over the long term, it’s prudent to curb emissions of heat-trapping gasses that worsen climate change and allergies. For now, keep the tissues close. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNUGZ6THMzOHQ5aTNWYmtCd1BnNi1KMzB1Y2VVaUQ4OXRtTUVZTm4yeU1nSGlIZHJMZ2RnbXFqaExhQ2pJdDlhWGsyRjBWcEstdWRFQzFwNDZ3a1VIWlg0U0h5SEd5ZjRBS1ZFRVZqVjZiLTZXUHhfSDBsOWpSUmI2cnliaVRPMUU</guid></item><item><title>Costly bill hangs over Kansas City man’s head after eerie encounter with bat - KCTV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQclhOblFraFRJaTJBck11NmFBc1FoZDd0V1FpU3J6b0tGRVpjeHYxaUhyT3ExeE4wRTRoLUNrRFlHcnM2b2tSa0FZazlVSzlMSmsyM3hTTWpfY19oRDdmT1l0OTBoV3JUQjBCTzloNm5mTnFwbkk3QW5lclBtbUpPaGVGVnRnbzNkZy1TaXRmeUhnXzh4bThoWVp6ZFpqSzJGZ3RKR2Niemt4WEpIX2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - As bats awaken from hibernation, one local man had a close encounter that was more than creepy — it was costly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Moving day cannot come soon enough for Simon Manzo and his roommate Finnigan Bagby. The two are packing up their South Kansas City apartment after Manzo woke up to a bat crawling on his bare chest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“I’m freaking out because I usually sleep shirtless, so the thing had actual physical contact with me,” Manzo said. “I was not mentally prepared for this in the slightest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Manzo cornered the animal, managed to secure it inside a container and released it back outside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“It’s very likely it could’ve slipped through one of the vents and gotten into Simon’s room or could’ve gotten under the door,” Bagby said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;An inspection from &lt;a href="https://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/departments/health/healthy-homes-rental-inspection-program" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/departments/health/healthy-homes-rental-inspection-program"&gt;Kansas City’s Healthy Homes program&lt;/a&gt; found potential entry points, including a fireplace in the unit and exterior holes in the building’s basement. A city spokesperson noted this was the first-of-its-kind complaint at the complex, which is why KCTV5 is not naming it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;While Manzo did not see any bite marks on his body, he went to the hospital worried about the potential for rabies — a deadly virus spread through animal bites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“The doctor told me you either get the vaccines or risk the 20/80 chance and possibly die in two months,” Manzo recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;He refused to risk it and took the vaccines. But it later cost the uninsured California native $14,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“I almost dropped my phone because I’ve never seen a number that big,” Manzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“$14,000. Girl, that’s crazy,” Bagby replied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Shelly Colatskie, a bat ecologist for the &lt;a href="https://mdc.mo.gov/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://mdc.mo.gov/"&gt;Missouri Department of Conservation&lt;/a&gt;, identified the flying mammal in Manzo’s room as a big brown bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“They’re harmless to humans,” Colatskie said. “Now, there’s always going to be those accidental encounters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The big brown bat is one of 16 species across the Show Me State, according to Colatskie. It’s also one of the most common in the Kansas City region, along with the evening and eastern red bats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“They’re coming out of hibernation right now and could be moving from their winter site to their summer site,” Colatskie explained. “And so, they can find the tiniest cracks and crevices to get through.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Colatskie said less than half of one percent of bats carry rabies. However, she said Manzo did the right thing given he had direct contact with the animal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“If you have any kind of encounter like that, it’s always best to be safe and go to the doctor,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Looking back, Manzo wishes he’d also called animal services, which could have tested the bat for rabies, potentially saving him thousands of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;A spokesperson for the complex told KCTV5 they found “nothing in regard to a bat – and immediately corrected separate issues” listed in the Healthy Homes inspection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;What should you do if you encounter a bat inside your home. KC Pet Project offers the following tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list | article-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Call animal services &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do not touch or hit the bat. If it is flying, wait until it lands somewhere. Open windows or doors to help it go back outside. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Always wear thick gloves when trying to move a bat. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Put any children and/or animals in a separate room. Close off other entrances to the house so the bat cannot leave the room. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the bat is grounded, secure the bat by placing a box or container over the bat. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the bat is hanging; place a box/container over the bat and use a piece of cardboard to trap the bat in the box or container. Turn the box or container right side up and secure the cardboard as a lid. Make sure there are small air holes in the lid/box. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;To learn more about bats in Missouri, &lt;a href="https://mdc.mo.gov/wildlife/nuisance-problem-species/bat-control" target="_self" rel="" title="https://mdc.mo.gov/wildlife/nuisance-problem-species/bat-control"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.
