    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It differs from recent recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the CDC, which was overhauled this year and replaced with individuals who have a history of spreading vaccine misinformation,” the AAP said in a news release.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The AAP recommendations are more explicit. It says that all children ages 6 through 23 months should receive a Covid-19 vaccine unless they have known allergies to the vaccine or its ingredients. It also recommends a single dose of the vaccine for children ages 2 through 18 years if they are at high risk of Covid-19, residents of long-term care facilities, have never been vaccinated against Covid-19, or live in a household with people who are high risk for Covid-19. It also says that the vaccine should be available for this age group even if they are in these risk groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

She shared her seven go-to products under $50 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;node=205662310011&amp;amp;tag=realsimple-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;from Amazon&lt;/a&gt; to treat these issues, including CeraVe moisturizing cream, La Roche-Posay serum, EltaMd sunscreen, and RoC retinol cream.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Harsh physical scrubs can create micro-tears in the skin, according to Dr. Engelman, which causes irritation and long-term sensitivity. She explained that polyhydroxy acids (PHAs) help encourage cell turnover while maintaining skin moisture, which is key for a long-term youthful appearance. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dr. Engelman shared that alcohol-heavy toners can strip the skin of its natural oils, disrupting the skin barrier and increasing dryness and irritation. “I love the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paulas-Choice-Niacinamide-Enlarged-Wrinkles-Normal/dp/B01GF1EOB8?tag=realsimple-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;Paula’s Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster Serum&lt;/a&gt;, which strengthens the skin barrier, refines pores, and improves skin tone without stripping moisture,” she said.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Niacinamide is anti-inflammatory and, according to the doctor, “works beautifully alongside retinoids and vitamin C.” This, she shares, is because niacinamide soothes inflammation and strengthens the skin barrier, which reduces irritation from retinoids and sensitivity from vitamin C. “At the same time, it doesn’t interfere with their effects, so you get smoother cell turnover from retinoids, brightening and antioxidant protection from vitamin C, and balanced, calm skin from niacinamide.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Dr. Engelman—and most dermatologists—SPF is the single most important anti-aging product you can own. She noted that using SPF consistently slows down aging, preserves collagen, and keeps your skin healthy long-term. “Sun exposure is a primary factor of premature aging. No serum, cream, or treatment can undo consistent UV damage, but daily broad-spectrum SPF protects your skin at the source,” she explained. “It’s the foundation for every other anti-aging strategy.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And while your favorite foundation with SPF might make your complexion look flawless on the surface, it might provide “insufficient sun protection, leaving skin vulnerable to UV damage and premature aging." Make sure you’re also wearing sunscreen meant for the face—tinted sunscreen, namely, offers sun protection with a little bit of color coverage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “My favorite [tinted sunscreen] is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EltaMD-Clear-Tinted-Sunscreen-Face/dp/B00ZPWR0N8?th=1&amp;amp;tag=realsimple-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;EltaMD UV Clear Tinted Broad-Spectrum SPF 46&lt;/a&gt;, which offers UVA/UVB and visible light protection with niacinamide and antioxidants. Niacinamide strengthens the skin and evens tone, while antioxidants neutralize free radicals from the sun and pollution, as per Dr. Engelman.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dr. Engelman says using strong prescription treatments on your own without medical guidance, over a long period, is a no. Not only can this damage your skin, but steroids can thin it, while hydroquinone can irritate or even darken skin over time (which is the opposite effect of what you desire). Azelaic acid is gentler, calms skin, lightens pigmentation, and is safe to use with most other ingredients, Dr. Engelman added. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pure coconut oil and other occlusives can be particularly problematic for acne-prone skin as the ingredients can clog pores, worsening breakouts, according to Dr. Engelman. “I love &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B000YJ2SLG?th=1&amp;amp;tag=realsimple-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;CeraVe Moisturizing Cream&lt;/a&gt;, which replenishes ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids for healthy, resilient skin without clogging pores.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ceramides are lipids naturally found in your skin that help form and maintain the skin’s barrier, she explains. A strong barrier locks in moisture, protects against irritants and pollution, and prevents dryness and sensitivity. “Using ceramides in skincare restores this barrier, keeping skin healthy, hydrated, and resilient.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Frequent use of harsh masks can strip the skin and cause irritation rather than firming, noted Dr. Engelman. “Instead of stripping, this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Hyalu-Hyaluronic-Anti-Wrinkle-Concentrate/dp/B075VX4QVM?th=1&amp;amp;tag=realsimple-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;La Roche-Posay serum&lt;/a&gt; deeply hydrates and plumps, temporarily reducing the appearance of fine lines and improving skin elasticity. It provides a great hydration boost for [skin of] any age.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Night creams that aren’t backed by science can often promise results without containing ingredients that actually work, thus never improving the skin, shared Dr. Engelman. “Backed by decades of retinol research, this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/RoC-Correxion-Anti-Aging-Reduction-Moisturizer/dp/B00027DMI8?th=1&amp;amp;tag=realsimple-onsite-backup-20" data-component="amazon" data-source="affiliate" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;affordable [OTC retinol] formula&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.rocskincare.com/pages/roc-clinically-proven-products-results" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"&gt;clinically proven&lt;/a&gt; to soften wrinkles and reduce photoaging signs with regular use.”

But these days, you're likely wishing you had taken her advice. Turns out, poor posture is one of the leading causes of back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/medical-services/spine/patient-resources/ergonomics-prolonged-sitting" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UCLA Health&lt;/a&gt;, "Poor sitting posture and workplace ergonomics over time can damage spinal structures and contribute to recurrent episodes of neck or back pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about all the hours spent hunched over laptops, desktops and smartphones — it adds up. Maintaining good posture in these situations isn't easy, and over time it can lead to muscle imbalances, disk compression and even nerve irritation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the strain on your back, &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/guidetogoodposture.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;MedlinePlus&lt;/a&gt; recommends changing positions frequently, taking regular breaks, keeping your feet flat on the floor when seated and using proper back support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Teeradej - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Muscle strains and sprains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you tweaked your back lifting a heavy box or pushed yourself a little too hard at the gym, muscle-related injuries are another major cause of back pain. A sudden awkward movement, poor lifting technique or even overuse can strain the muscles, tendons or ligaments in your back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10265-back-strains-and-sprains" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, symptoms of a muscle strain or sprain include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain that gets worse with movement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sudden muscle cramping or spasms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decreased range of motion or difficulty walking, bending or standing straight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bulging or herniated disks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between each vertebra in your spine are soft disks that act as cushions. But when one of those disks bulges or herniates, pain is often not far behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When a disk herniates, some of the cushioning material slips out of the casing that holds it. This is also called a ruptured disk or slipped disk," Shawna Seed writes for &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/treatments-for-herniated-disk" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When that cushioning presses on nearby nerves, it can cause pain, numbness or weakness. Most herniated disks occur in the lower back, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/herniated-disk/symptoms-causes/syc-20354095" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, but they can also happen in the neck — depending on which part of the spine is affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, herniated disks cause no symptoms, so you may not even know you have one without proper &lt;a href="https://www.taylormedmri.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;imaging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Arthritis and degenerative conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all back pain is your fault — sometimes it's just part of getting older. As you age, the disks and joints in your spine naturally start to wear down, which can lead to chronic issues like osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis or other degenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/spinal-arthritis" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt; explains that as the cartilage between the joints breaks down over time, it causes inflammation and pain. Since this kind of pain comes from physical wear and tear, it tends to flare up when you bend or twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you've had a back injury in the past, that can raise your chances of developing degenerative arthritis later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back pain isn't always caused by a physical injury. In many cases, stress plays a bigger role than people realize. As Traci Pedersen writes for &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/stress/can-stress-cause-back-pain#symptoms" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;, "Stress can lead to inflammation, muscle spasms, and tension in your back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with those physical reactions, stress can also reduce blood flow to your back muscles, heighten your sensitivity to pain and lead to poor posture — all of which can make back pain worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Regular exercise, stretching, and good posture can help alleviate back pain, while stress management techniques like meditation and deep breathing can help reduce stress levels," Pedersen adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How an MRI can help you find relief for your back pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter the cause of your back pain, the key to relief is getting an accurate diagnosis — and advanced imaging can help you pinpoint the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) provides a clear, detailed picture of your spine, muscles, disks and nerves. It can help identify the exact cause of your pain and guide your treatment plan — whether that's physical therapy, chiropractic care or surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, waiting for insurance to cover your MRI means waiting for that pain relief. Referrals, long waits and high deductibles can all be obstacles standing in your way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why more people are turning to TaylorMed MRI, Utah's go-to provider for fast, affordable and insurance-free MRI scans. At &lt;a href="https://www.taylormedmri.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;TaylorMed MRI,&lt;/a&gt; you don't need a doctor's referral.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Several of the studies in the &lt;em&gt;Cureus &lt;/em&gt;review found that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/benefits-of-ginger-8731069" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ginger supplements&lt;/a&gt; helped reduce &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-lower-systolic-blood-pressure-5202628" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;systolic blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; (the top number).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s important because high systolic blood pressure puts extra strain on your heart and blood vessels over time, which can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Specific compounds in ginger may work similarly to calcium channel blocker medications,” said Liz Weinandy, MPH, RDN, LD, a registered dietitian nutritionist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “These medications allow blood vessels to relax and slow the heart rate, which lowers blood pressure,” she added.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One study in the review found that people with obesity who took &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/metformin-how-to-prevent-side-effects-1087301" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt; significantly improved their cholesterol levels after taking up to 1.8 grams of ginger daily. Their triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels all dropped.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This effect may be due to ginger’s natural phytochemicals, such as &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/polyphenols-5217399" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;polyphenols&lt;/a&gt; and flavonoids, which could help prevent cholesterol from forming.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Ginger’s active components may inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver, increase bile acid secretion, and enhance the activity of enzymes that break down fats,” said Lindsay Malone, MS, RDN, LD, nutrition instructor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Ginger is rich in phenolic compounds such as &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;gingerols&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;shogaols&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span data-tts="true"&gt;paradols&lt;/span&gt;, which have potent anti-inflammatory effects,” said Malone. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One study cited in the review found that taking 2 grams of ginger daily for three months reduced inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This can happen for several reasons. “Some phytochemicals help to keep bacteria, viruses, and other microbes in check by boosting our immune system,” said Weinandy. “Others help neutralize free radicals, which can damage cells in our bodies.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Those same bioactive compounds can also produce &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-high-in-antioxidants-11760827" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; effects, said Malone. Antioxidants help protect your cells, including those in your heart and blood vessels, from damage caused by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/information-about-free-radicals-2249103" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;free radicals&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The research suggests that these antioxidant effects may help prevent &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-atherosclerosis-1745908" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, a condition in which plaque builds up in the arteries, increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, and heart failure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Supports Healthy Blood Sugar Levels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The review also suggested ginger may benefit blood sugar management, particularly in people with &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/type-2-diabetes-overview-4581874" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of its compounds, 6-gingerol, helps move &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/glucose-5188205" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;glucose&lt;/a&gt; from your bloodstream into your muscle cells, lowering high blood sugar and improving insulin sensitivity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In one study in the review, people with type 2 diabetes who took 1,600 milligrams of ginger daily for three months saw reduced fasting blood sugar, insulin levels, and HbA1c—a marker of long-term blood sugar control.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other research suggests ginger may help reduce insulin resistance, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-should-you-add-ginger-to-your-diet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Should You Add Ginger to Your Diet? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The review's takeaway is promising—ginger is packed with natural compounds that support heart health in several ways. But there are a few things to keep in mind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For one, the studies in the review vary significantly in dosage, duration, population, and form of ginger—powders, extracts, and capsules—which limits standardization, Nyree Dardarian, EdD, assistant clinical professor of nutrition at Drexel University, told Verywell.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because of that, it's hard to draw definitive conclusions about the health benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, adding ginger to your routine is worth considering. You can even use fresh or powdered ginger in recipes and smoothies. If you have a health condition or take prescription medications, it's smart to check with a healthcare provider before taking a ginger supplement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember, ginger isn't a magic bullet. "Ginger is a great addition, but it works best in the context of an overall healthy lifestyle," said Dardarian.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-key-takeaways"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Key Takeaways &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ginger might seem like a simple spice, but it may be a powerful support for your heart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research has linked it to benefits like reduced blood pressure, cholesterol, inflammation, and plaque build-up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While studies have used up to 2 grams of ginger daily, speak with your healthcare provider to ensure safe usage for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

With reports of deer that have been dead for a while, there is not viable tissue available to be tested, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Is epizootic hemorrhagic disease a threat to humans, other animals?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Ohio Department of Natural Resources &lt;a href="https://ohiodnr.gov/discover-and-learn/safety-conservation/wildlife-management/wildlife-disease/epizootic-hemorrhagic-disease" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;advised on a web page&lt;/a&gt; that there is currently no risk in handling infected deer, eating venison from infected deer, or getting bitten by an infected midge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;However, the department stated that without testing the deer, it can't be known for sure what it was suffering from, so it's important to be cautious and never kill or eat a sick deer, and to wear rubber gloves to field dress a deer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Epizootic hemorrhagic disease also does not pose a "serious threat" to livestock, advises the state department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Where has epizootic hemorrhagic disease been found this year so far?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://ohiodnr.gov/discover-and-learn/safety-conservation/wildlife-management/wildlife-disease/epizootic-hemorrhagic-disease" data-type="link" data-id="https://ohiodnr.gov/discover-and-learn/safety-conservation/wildlife-management/wildlife-disease/epizootic-hemorrhagic-disease" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;a map&lt;/a&gt; on the Ohio Department of Natural Resources website, the following counties have been confirmed to have epizootic hemorrhagic disease cases in 2025: Union, Morrow, Fairfield, Guernsey, Athens, Washington and Meigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The following counties have also had reports of dead or sick deer this year: Brown, Highland, Hocking, Morgan, Noble, and Monroe. This map was last updated on Aug. 12, so there are not yet reports shown in Hamilton County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In 2024, the Division of Wildlife confirmed deer deaths from hemorrhagic disease in 32 Ohio counties. A 2025 summary of Ohio's deer program shows the division received more than 400 reports, totaling more than 1,000 dead or sick dear observations in Defiance and Paulding counties with less deaths in other areas of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/18/PCIN/85712523007-ehd-lg.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=389&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/18/PCIN/85712523007-ehd-lg.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=778&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Map of confirmed epizootic hemorrhagic disease cases and reports of dead or sick deer in 2025 in Ohio.

It is transmitted to deer through the bite of an infected midge, a very small fly. There is currently no treatment of the disease in wild populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Symptoms vary, but can include deer appearing disoriented, showing little to no fear of humans, appearing feverish, having respiratory distress, and pronounced swelling of head, neck, tongue and eyelids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Outbreaks happen around the time of droughts and stop after the first freeze, which kills the midges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Until then, this disease has the potential to cause high rates of deer mortality particularly in the Midwest, where the deer population hasn't developed resistance to the disease. Due to this lack of resistance, Ohio deer are likely to die within three days following the start of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hemorrhagic disease is also a general term that can refer to bluetongue virus, which has similar symptoms but can pose a serious threat to livestock like sheep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;If it isn't epizootic hemorrhagic disease, what else could it be?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In 2022, The Enquirer reported on &lt;a href="/story/news/2022/08/24/zombie-deer-colerain-township-ohio-dnr-reports-epizootic-hemorrhagic-disease/65417730007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2022/08/24/zombie-deer-colerain-township-ohio-dnr-reports-epizootic-hemorrhagic-disease/65417730007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;"zombie deer,"&lt;/a&gt; a misnomer used for two diseases that cause deer to act strangely. One was epizootic hemorrhagic disease. The other is much rarer in Ohio: chronic wasting disease. It was first found in the state in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Chronic wasting disease is not caused by a virus. It is caused by a prion, a misfolded protein. Mad cow disease, which affected cattle in the UK in the 1990s, is caused by a prion that was able to spread to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;According to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, there is "no strong evidence" that chronic wasting disease can spread to humans, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted that the meat of contaminated animals should not be consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Deer infected with chronic wasting disease can take months to show symptoms, as opposed to a couple of weeks with epizootic hemorrhagic disease. In the late stages of the disease, deer might stagger, drool excessively and, again, show little to no fear of humans, the department stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While the disease is not common in Ohio, it has been found in free-ranging populations in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, as well as many western states and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How to take action if you see a deer behaving strangely&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Ohio Division of Wildlife is asking people to report dead or sick deer so disease can be tracked throughout the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;According to the 2025 annual report of Ohio's deer program, the Division of Wildlife relies heavily on reports from the public to document epizootic hermorragic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="gnt_ar_b_ul"&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_ar_b_ul_li"&gt;If you live in the village of Newtown, Synan recommends you call Newtown police at 513-561-7697.

Here’s a new addition: Ozempic vulva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making its turn around the social media frequently now, Ozempic vulva isn’t a medical diagnosis; rather, it’s a label coined by women noticing unexpected changes in their vulva or vaginal area after using Ozempic or similar GLP-1 weight-loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozempic is a widely used weight-loss and diabetes medication, but some women taking it are reporting surprising and sensitive side effects. These changes include sagging skin, dryness, muscle weakness, loss of fullness, altered discharge, and even pelvic weakness. While it may sound surprising, experts say these shifts are often tied to rapid weight loss, hormone shifts, and hydration changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Ozempic?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozempic (semaglutide) is a well-known prescription drug that’s used to treat the blood sugar of people with type 2 diabetes. Ozempic is given as an injection under your skin. Ozempic is also used to lower the risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, or death) in people who have type 2 diabetes and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration first approved the injectable medication for treating diabetes in 2017; the agency approved a drug with a higher dose of the active ingredient in Ozempic, called semaglutide, to treat obesity in 2021, under the brand name Wegovy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, talk of the drug has popped up across the internet. The prescription drug keeps gaining attention as celebrities, a tech mogul, and TikTok influencers have described taking it to lose weight in short time frames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Ozempic vulva?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known casually as 'Ozempic vulva' or 'Ozempic vagina', the issue refers to changes in the genital area linked to rapid weight loss. It’s not an official medical term. Instead, it’s a nickname women have coined to describe certain changes in the genital area while using GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, Wegovy, or Mounjaro. Though not formally acknowledged by drugmakers, more users are sharing what they notice, and experts are now paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As reported by the NY Post, Dr. Sherry Ross, an OB-GYN in Santa Monica, CA, and author of “She-ology” and “She-ology, the She-quel,” told HealthCentral, “[The rapidity of] weight loss can cause visible skin sagging, laxity and wrinkles throughout the body,” adding, “All areas of the body can show visible skin changes in response to this significant weight loss,” she added, “including the lower belly, pubic mons, and inner and outer labia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why does it happen and how?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vagina is surrounded by two sets of “lips” or folds of skin. The labia majora are the outer, larger folds, while the labia minora are the inner, smaller folds. They extend from the mons pubis, the rounded, fatty area over the pubic bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some GLP-1 users have complained that their weight loss has led to a decrease in the volume of their labia majora, causing it to appear deflated or aged. Labia puffing may help. The procedure restores volume and fullness to the labia majora via dermal fillers or fat grafting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts point to a few key factors contributing to Ozempic vulva:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Rapid weight loss:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fast reduction in body fat doesn’t allow skin and soft tissues to adapt, leading to sagging or volume loss in areas like the labia and pubic mound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Muscle loss:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alongside fat loss, muscle mass, including pelvic floor muscles, can decrease. This may reduce support and sensation in the vulvovaginal area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Hormones and hydration:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Less fat means less stored estrogen, which helps maintain vaginal moisture and tissue health. GI side effects like vomiting or diarrhea can cause dehydration, worsening dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Microbiome disruption:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since GLP-1 drugs slow digestion, they can alter gut bacteria. Because gut and vaginal microbes are linked, this may increase the risk of imbalances and infections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per the NY Post, Dr. Michael Tahery, a board-certified OB/GYN in LA, noted on his website that the fillers used in labia puffing are comparable to facial fillers. The tiny injections can last up to eight months a session and don’t require recovery time. With fat grafts, a doctor injects a small amount of fat from the patient’s thigh, abdomen, or elsewhere in their body into the labia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The benefit of this treatment is that it does not pose risks for rejection because it uses the patient’s own fat,” Tahery wrote. “The fat is easily reabsorbed by the body over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labiaplasty to reshape the labia and vaginal tightening to restore firmness to the vaginal canal may also provide relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ozempic Vulva: Common complaints&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens due to the phenomenon of Ozempic vulva? Medical professionals have outlined three key issues associated with this phenomenon:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sagging or aged appearance of the labia:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rapid fat loss can diminish the padding in the outer labia and pubic area, causing a “deflated,” wrinkled, or aged look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Pelvic weakness and vaginal looseness:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; GLP-1 medications don’t just reduce fat; they can also lead to muscle loss, including in pelvic muscles. Women may feel reduced tone or looseness, impacting comfort and sexual experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dryness and vaginal irritation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dehydration from GI side effects like nausea or diarrhea, along with hormone shifts that reduce natural lubrication, can lead to dryness and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other related symptoms noted include changes in vaginal discharge, odor, and infections, as the gut-vagina microbial balance may be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Real women, real experiences&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As reported by The Sun, 30-year-old Paige Osprey noticed sagging of her labia after losing three stone (≈19 kg) with weight-loss injections like Ozempic. She even mentioned what she called a ‘cameltoe’ effect in tight clothing, a visibility she found distressing. The changes interfered with intimacy and self-esteem. As reported by The Sun, Paige opted for a labia puffing procedure using hyaluronic acid filler, which some call “the other lip filler,” and says it restored volume and confidence, even renewing her sex life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What to do if you notice Ozempic vulva?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, consult your healthcare provider if you experience dryness, sagging, or discomfort. Second order of business: hydrate well, especially if you're dealing with gastrointestinal side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider supporting your pelvic floor health with exercises and moderating the pace of weight loss to give your body time to adapt. Topical solutions like lubricants, moisturizers, or probiotics can support vaginal health and balance microbiome risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides, cosmetic or reconstructive options such as labia puffing (fillers or fat grafts) or labiaplasty are available. However, these should be approached carefully and discussed with a qualified provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="96"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt; This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. “Ozempic vulva” is an informal term and not a recognized medical diagnosis.

Picture this: you’re watching a commercial that’s either supposed to raise awareness about heart disease or is made to promote a medication to remedy the same. When they show you a heart attack, it’s often the crushing chest pain that’s in focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when we think of a heart attack, we picture sudden and acute chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, for many women out there, the signs of a heart attack are far more subtle and hence, easy to miss. Instead of dramatic symptoms, they may experience fatigue, nausea, shortness of breath, or even a sense of unease. Because these signs are often mild or vague, they can be easily dismissed as everyday discomforts. And ignoring these hidden warning signals can be dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Heart Attack Warning Signs That Women May Confuse With Menopause Symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dmitry Yaranov, MD (cardiologist), who goes by the username of “heart_transplant_doc” on Instagram, urges the same, saying, “Heart attacks in women often don’t look like heart attacks at all. In my practice, I’ve seen so many women with symptoms they never expected would be related to their hearts—nausea, back or jaw pain, sudden fatigue, shortness of breath.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per him, “These symptoms can be subtle, making it easy to think it’s ‘just stress’ or something minor.” He also adds, “We need to recognize that women’s heart symptoms are often different than men’s. If something feels off, listen to your body. Don’t wait until it’s an emergency—trust your instincts and take action. Early recognition is key, and advocating for better heart health awareness for women can save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what are these subtle symptoms that might be sending SOS signals before the attack actually happens? Understanding these lesser-known signs is vital because early help can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="28384657" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Unusual-fatigue-and-weakness" source="Orion"&gt;Unusual fatigue and weakness&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel exhausted lately, more than usual? Do you feel like you’ve drained all your energy just after doing simple daily chores? One of the most common subtle signs among women is extreme tiredness, even after rest. This fatigue often builds up gradually and may persist for days or weeks before other symptoms appear. Simple tasks can feel unusually exhausting, hinting that something more serious might be underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or dizziness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women may feel breathless even when not active, or lightheaded and dizzy without warning. No, it’s not always the exhaustion from physical labor, or even a mere fluctuation in the blood pressure level. These symptoms can mislead one to think of stress, low blood pressure, or respiratory issues. Yet they can be a sign of insufficient oxygen getting to the heart or brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Jaw, neck, back, shoulder, or arm discomfort&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain may radiate to areas far from the chest, such as the jaw, neck, upper back, shoulders, or arms. Ana again, they might not be the consequence of just spending yourself too much, and dealing with a lot of stress, despite often being perceived that way. These sensations may feel like muscle strain, tightness, or pressure, rather than sharp pain, making it easy to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Digestive symptoms: Nausea, indigestion, or stomach pain&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel a strange, unexplained discomfort inside your stomach? It might not be the food or any regular bowel movement issues. Symptoms like nausea, vomiting, indigestion, or upper abdominal pain are common in women experiencing heart attacks. These can be misread as heartburn, flu, or food poisoning, causing delays in seeking help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cold sweats, clammy skin, or anxiety&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although most of us brush them away thinking that symptoms like anxiety and cold sweats are issues related to stress and mental health, in reality, they can be as much as subtle signs of an onset of a heart attack. Apart from being the obvious symptoms, these are quiet but common signs that often come along with, or instead of, other more prominent and recognizable symptoms of a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep disturbances&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disturbed sleep, trouble falling asleep, waking frequently, or still feeling exhausted after a full night's rest aren’t always screaming insomnia, a sleep disorder, or simply a consequence of stress; they can signal something deeper at play. Research reveals that many women notice these changes days or weeks before a heart event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Silent or ‘invisible’ heart attacks&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, some heart attacks show up with almost no symptoms. Known as ‘silent’ heart attacks, these events can go undetected, even by the person experiencing them. Women may attribute mild discomfort or indigestive feelings to stress or fatigue, only to later discover heart damage via medical tests like ECG or MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why women’s symptoms are often misunderstood&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease is the leading cause of death for women, yet awareness of warning signs is significantly lower. Conforming to the stereotypes, severe chest pain is still viewed as the only signal of a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, biological and hormonal differences in women also shape how symptoms appear. Conditions like coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) or artery spasms can cause unusual chest discomfort but go undetected in standard tests. Women may experience heart attacks without large arterial blockages due to microvascular dysfunction or artery spasms (MINOCA). Another example: spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare but serious cause, particularly in younger women, postpartum, or those healthy otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a well-documented gender bias in heart disease care, sometimes called the ‘Yentl syndrome’, where women’s symptoms are under-recognized or misclassified, delaying diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What you can do: Prevention, awareness, and action&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Learn and share the subtle signs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know that symptoms in women often go beyond chest pain, such as fatigue, breathlessness, discomfort in odd places, stomach issues, sweating, dizziness, or sleep problems, which can all be warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Early action matters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quick response saves lives. Delays can lead to serious heart damage or fatal outcomes.

And they also slow down the rate at which the stomach empties, making us feel fuller for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Too high a dose of the drugs can slow the emptying process too far, leading to nausea, vomiting and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One in five users of weight-loss wonder jabs such as Mounjaro and Wegovy stop taking them within a year, due to intolerable side-effects ranging from nausea and vomiting to gallstones and pancreatitis – a serious infection of the pancreas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In more severe cases, it can cause gastroparesis – or stomach paralysis – where the stomach muscles are weakened and food is not digested properly. The worst-case scenario here is that surgery is needed to insert a feeding tube to temporarily bypass the stomach, or to remove a mass of undigested food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, too low a dose can mean the stomach empties too quickly for the drug to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weight-loss jabs are usually started at a dose of 0.25mg once a week, rising gradually to 2.4mg after around four months. But effects vary – and working out the correct dose can be informed guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition, there have been reports of websites selling pens (for self-injecting) containing either the wrong dose or no active ingredient at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it’s hoped the device, developed in New Zealand, could help doctors work out precisely what dose each patient needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Packed with dozens of tiny electrodes, the high-tech pad carries out something called an electrogastrogram – which measures the stomach’s electrical activity (from stomach contractions) – in much the same way as an electrocardiogram (ECG) tracks the heart’s electrical signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This enables medics to map a clearer picture of how the stomach is functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The normal rate for a healthy stomach to empty is two to four hours – but studies suggest that this can be much slower in patients taking semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Could a stick-on pad, that looks like a giant Band-Aid and is placed on the stomach for just a few hours, reduce the weight-loss jab drop-out rate – by enabling people on the drugs to ensure they’re taking the correct dose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After four hours, most patients’ stomachs are still 30 per cent full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Gastric Alimetry pad is connected to a small electronic box or reader, which is paired with an app on an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients fast for at least six hours beforehand to ensure an empty stomach, then consume a cereal bar. The device monitors electrical activity over four hours as the food passes through the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The device, designed as a non-invasive alternative to endoscopes (where a camera is passed down the throat attached to a tiny tube), is already being used in some private clinics to assess patients with conditions such as acid reflux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A trial is also under way at University College London involving NHS patients with chronic stomach symptoms who have not been helped by previous treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, a study by scientists from the University of Auckland in New Zealand backs the idea it could be used to help people on GLP-1s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers, whose work was published in the journal Gastroenterology in May, used the pad to measure stomach function in 20 healthy volunteers who’d been given different doses of the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 15 per cent of cases it detected that the drugs had trigged gastric dysrhythmia - when the stomach’s pulses become chaotic - causing a range of symptoms including nausea, early fullness and sometimes vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rehan Haidry, a gastroenterologist at the Cleveland Clinic in London, says that the Gastric Alimetry pad gives doctors the ability to measure actual stomach function reliably – something an endoscopy, which offers a visual examination of the food pipe for instance, cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told Good Health: ‘This device will find the ideal point at which the stomach is slowly emptying but not so slow that it causes the side-effects.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Anthony Hobson, a gastrointestinal clinical scientist at the private Functional Gut Clinic in London, agrees: ‘Rather than people giving up on these jabs, this technology could find the “sweet spot” so they would still have the weight loss but not &lt;a target="_self" href="/debate/article-14280009/FERGUS-WALSH-fat-jabs-transform-lives-obese-experts-bankrupt-NHS.html"&gt;endure some unpleasant side-effects&lt;/a&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is, however, not cheap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For patients who want to undergo the test privately, it costs £1,875 and Professor Hobson admits that ‘only the patients with the highest medical needs and worst side-effects might choose this approach’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And new ways to avoid side-effects when taking weight-loss jabs are being investigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study in the Journal of Clinical Medicine in 2022 found eating foods such as crackers, apples or mint might help those suffering with nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, research published in the journal Obesity Pillars in May this year also found that acupressure wristbands, normally worn to ease travel and morning sickness, could alleviate nausea symptoms in people taking GLP-1s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a group of 31 people who were taking the weight-loss jabs and suffering from nausea, it led to an 80 per cent reduction in the severity of their nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s thought pressure on certain nerve pathways in the wrist calms the nervous system and regulates stomach muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 00:51:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7gFBVV95cUxOUlBPTnV3SEh2YlBFbjhFaGJRMzVQZUNYbzl1c0llOFZ5bHpTU214dkFiSVJPUzJyMmFZeVFFYTk3bU5OcEJ2V2hvVFpIMnNQc3ByMnVpb0JwbFhsQXpqYUtKdy0ySlo2Sk93b2lJYmVkcmk5dVZjc3JXSG4wSVAwLVJkTXl2MC1hZnlReWFxTlozaUI0N0pIc0hzbklfNDVDemZSbnRNX0dqejdyVFRRQmliVFQtVEREdkNtYWJsYldxSmY4YWJQSEdkS3Y0S3RXZTB6blFBQmZkdGV1cFpNTVB1cEEtOG1vNEJVU19R</guid></item><item><title>重建罕见突变可以赋予几乎通用的病毒免疫力数天- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxNOW9DemxDVlB1NnVaNFNUMHFGVTlNYS04R3N4cF9kWmRMQXpETnpSVXNneHFvaTMzQmJSSlFmNlNPcFhjNUh0Qk5ONk1CX2N5S042LVEyVFZpT3hnZVd5M01RSkhZVGZXOXYwM3owX0ZNb2VYSGpVYXZaR3FKcFZZT1dTSUxTS2tlYVZXbFVYUHp2STNRV1pvQWJMVDR6X1RKU3RKT1NlZTdqNXdC?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A rare genetic mutation appears to make people basically invulnerable to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="171703" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; – and it could potentially be harnessed as a therapy. Researchers have now shown this surprising viral protection can be replicated in mice and hamsters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have yet to find a &lt;span&gt;virus&lt;/span&gt; that can break through the therapy's defenses [in cell culture tests]," &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/one-universal-antiviral-rule-them-all"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Columbia University immunologist Dusan Bogunovic, who first discovered this unusual antiviral superpower &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1224026"&gt;13 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutation, a deficiency in interferon-stimulated gene 15 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISG15"&gt;ISG15&lt;/a&gt;), causes a mild yet persistent inflammation across the body. Examining patients' immune cells revealed they'd had the usual run of encounters with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="171703" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;, measles, chickenpox, and mumps, yet they'd never reported feeling particularly ill as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/which-infectious-disease-could-be-the-biggest-problem-in-2025-an-expert-explains"&gt;Which Infectious Disease Could Be The Biggest Problem in 2025? An Expert Explains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further investigation revealed their body's &lt;span&gt;virus&lt;/span&gt;-fighting proteins were constantly on a low level alert, never really put away for later like in most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the back of my mind, I kept thinking that if we could produce this type of light immune activation in other people, we could protect them from just about any &lt;span&gt;virus&lt;/span&gt;," &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/one-universal-antiviral-rule-them-all"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bogunovic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Bogunovic and colleagues have used technology similar to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-who-made-covid-vaccine-possible-awarded-nobel-prize"&gt;mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; to provide a temporary ISG15 deficiency in lab animals. The therapy provides instructions that help target cells build 10 proteins that the team identified as primarily responsible for the antiviral effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171750" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171750" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/mRNATranslationProcess-642x642-1.jpg" alt="Rare Mutation Seems to Make People Impervious to Viruses" class="wp-image-171750 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/mRNATranslationProcess-642x642-1.jpg 588w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/mRNATranslationProcess-642x642-1-535x415.jpg 535w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171750" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The technology uses our body's natural ability to build proteins from mRNA instructions. (Ali Damouh/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, the bodies of test mice and hamsters successfully created more of these proteins, which attack the viruses at multiple stages of their life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then challenged the vaccinated animals with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="171703" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;SARS-CoV-2&lt;/a&gt;. The protective proteins restricted the infection, but did not appear to interfere with the rest of the animals' immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We only generate a small amount of these 10 proteins, for a very short time, and that leads to much less inflammation than what we see in ISG15-deficient individuals," &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/one-universal-antiviral-rule-them-all"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Bogunovic. "But that inflammation is enough to prevent [viral] diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of inoculation were temporary, lasting up to four days. That might not sound like long enough to be very useful as a vaccine platform, but it could be administered as short-term protection for healthcare workers, even before vaccines targeting specific viruses have been developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the technology will work even if we don't know the identity of the &lt;span&gt;virus&lt;/span&gt;," &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/one-universal-antiviral-rule-them-all"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bogunovic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technique has the potential to massively boost our responses during future pandemics that may be similar to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="171703" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spanish-flu"&gt;Spanish Flu&lt;/a&gt;, which have killed millions of people at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is still in the extremely early stages of testing. There are many challenges to resolve around how to safely deliver the mRNA to where it's needed in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once the therapy reaches our cells, it works, but the delivery of any nucleic acid, DNA or RNA, into the part of the body you want to protect is currently the biggest challenge in the field," &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/one-universal-antiviral-rule-them-all"&gt;qualifies&lt;/a&gt; Bogunovic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://time.com/7309755/cutting-mrna-research-deadly-mistake/"&gt;political and social pushback&lt;/a&gt; against mRNA technology may also prove to be a large hurdle.

In dry weather, the spores spread as dry dust and soil are kicked up because of construction, agriculture or wind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think climate change is the main reason to explain this type of dramatic explosion,” Yang told SFGATE. “I don’t think anything else can explain this type of phenomenon.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang said his lab used to see about one case of Valley fever a month, but now it often sees five cases per month, including an occasional pediatric case of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When children get this kind of very severe [Valley fever,] it’s very devastating,” Yang said, explaining that infection can disseminate and spread to the bone in children, requiring chronic treatments. “They’re not going to live normally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. John Galgiani, the director for the University of Arizona Valley Fever Center for Excellence, said one explanation for the increase in cases is that health officials have streamlined some of the reporting process. Galgiani pointed out that patients who tested positive for Valley fever used to have to be tracked down to confirm their symptoms before their cases were reported to the state, and in recent years, that requirement has been loosened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The actual impact of the disease is probably not as great a change as the numbers appear,” Galgiani told SFGATE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galgiani said while cases have increased, they are still variable, and occasionally, the number of annual cases has sometimes dipped below previous levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that it looks higher now doesn’t mean it’s going to be even higher next year, and then higher after that,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-2" data-large-id="Inline-4" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galgiani did echo Yang’s concern that changes in climate could push the fungus into new areas of the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s estimates that climate change, or the long-term effect of climate change will increase the distribution of the infection across the western United States, all the way to the Canadian border,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valley fever can cause severe fatigue, cough, fever, night sweats and muscle pain, and it can last weeks to months. In severe cases, the spores can &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverSymptoms.aspx" data-link="native" class=""&gt;disseminate&lt;/a&gt; in the body, infecting the bones, brain or skin. In these cases, a person may need to be on anti-fungal medications for the rest of their lives, according to Yang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valley fever can also be deadly, with 1 out of 10 people hospitalized for the disease dying from it, &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverBasics.aspx" data-link="native" class=""&gt;according &lt;/a&gt;to the California Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-3" data-large-id="Inline-5" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some people will have severe symptoms, Yang said a majority of people will either not get sick or have mild symptoms if they come into contact with the spores. Since so many people do not get diagnosed, the actual number of cases is likely about 10 to 18 times higher than what is reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverGroupsAtRisk.aspx" data-link="native" class=""&gt;most at risk for developing Valley fever&lt;/a&gt; are those who live or work in agriculture or construction in areas where it’s endemic. People over 60, pregnant people, people who have diabetes and those with compromised immune systems are at higher risk of having serious or debilitating symptoms if they get sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galgiani said if you think you could be at risk and start to get symptoms, you should get tested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-4" data-large-id="Inline-6" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The recommendation is, if you have pneumonia in Bakersfield, for example, or other endemic places, or if you visited there, you should be tested,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SFGATE</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 23:46:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNVW5ycy0wRS1GX0x2ZlRFTXJWSXZsTFZUamdYWlAtMUUzTlJEMDMzRFlPaHI3TmNBOWpMV3dXQnl4bHh5QVpOVnkyX0ZNdFRFMnExbUVBbFV1X3I2YUNkaWN3VVVtUnlTV2pPZU5KRmFwdTByNkR5SV9wa1JCZURLeHhuaVF0V3ZScE4xOVphNzJnTnc3</guid></item><item><title>专家说， “僵尸兔”病毒已经存在了一段时间，有助于HPV研究- KUSA.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxOb1JDeDlQbXVWd2NRNS1Zb0l6V09uQ3ktUzF5NHlhMXB3MTIzV3BrWmg4ZHdtcXZXWWY4RUQzWG9vVXZXT2UxZ1R0bGNUMFh5bmtoSHlqT1pCUUR5ZXNLRVVQRm1zMlpZaUc1LVJxRGtxVnByMDhQdGJMblMxQ1Q5TE5mbExBTGtxQXNVOVlFUWNnb2ZQZmtHd3pYcWF0cFhwWTV0YWJJUkZRdUZPS25Jd2xRUzA3a1lKanF1bE5LakxhWU5Cb2lobF9B?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

If this damage affects genes that control growth and death, mutations accumulate, allowing abnormal cells to multiply unchecked, eventually forming tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutrition scientists in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/iran/index.html" id="mol-b94af090-7c66-11f0-ba99-0d96d46a8b7e"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/afghanistan/index.html" id="mol-b94a0630-7c66-11f0-ba99-0d96d46a8b7e"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; reported that consuming almonds, around two large handfuls, significantly improved oxidative stress markers by reducing DNA and lipid damage while boosting antioxidant defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The benefits were strongest with higher almond intake, likely due to their vitamin E, polyphenols, and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results varied between studies, though, possibly due to differences in the ways almonds were prepared, such as salting or roasting, or the study subjects’ health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almonds are widely recognized &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13334127/Eat-nuts-seeds-fight-disease-Healthy-snacks-added-5-day-guidance-boost-nations-health-report-suggests.html"&gt;as a nutritious food&lt;/a&gt;, but quantifying their specific health benefits has proven difficult due to inconsistent research findings stemming from key variables across studies, including differences in almond preparation methods (such as roasting versus raw), study durations, and characteristics of the people in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest research consolidates previous studies and fragmented findings to better identify how and how much almonds benefit the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eating roughly 60g almonds daily (about 2 handfuls) reduced oxidative damage, lowering DNA harm and lipid damage (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After reviewing all the research, scientists focused on eight high-quality studies involving 424 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The studies tested different groups, including healthy adults, smokers, and people with chronic diseases, using almond doses ranging from a small handful, about five grams, to about six handfuls, or roughly 168g, per day for one to six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almonds' health benefits depend on the serving size. Eating at least two large handfuls daily, about 60g, made a significant impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating this amount reduced cell membrane damage by a statistically significant 0.46 units, lowered DNA damage by 5.83 units, and boosted the body's natural defenses by 2.02 units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have been trying to prove almonds’ anti-cancer impacts for years, since the 1997 report of the World Cancer Research Fund, which concluded that, while there are ‘theoretical reasons to believe that diets high in nuts and seeds might protect against some cancers, the evidence is currently lacking.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over two decades of research has revealed important connections between nut consumption &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/jsfa.2659?casa_token=4R4dHrw8ehEAAAAA%3A30JFIBoxJen8wtjhJCChlNOz_JLhuBadWr9Llhclpp3aaa4_DXQs243otC9hP88qobJ0-1jlZECcE_M"&gt;and cancer prevention&lt;/a&gt;, with almonds emerging as a particularly promising food in this field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Large observational studies spanning multiple countries have found that people who regularly eat nuts tend to have lower rates of certain cancers, particularly prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The evidence also suggests a potential protective effect against colon cancer in women, with those consuming just a small handful of nuts daily, about six grams, showing measurable benefits compared to those who did not eat almonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The figure, published in Advances in Nutrition, shows how eating different amounts of nuts affects a person's risk of serious health problems. The solid red line shows whether more nuts lower risk (when the line goes down) or do not make much difference (when it is flat). The blue shaded area shows the confidence interval. When it is narrow, researchers are more certain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Population-level findings are supported by laboratory research showing that almonds may actively combat cancer development at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Animal studies have shown that eating an almond-rich diet can reduce the formation of precancerous growths in the digestive tract and may trigger natural anti-tumor defenses in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almonds pack a powerful nutritional punch, making them a favorite snack among dietitians and nutritionists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 study in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831323000686#:~:text=An%20intake%20of%2028%20g,and%20diabetes%20incidence%20were%20mixed."&gt;Advances in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; showed that eating 28 grams of nuts daily, such as almonds, walnuts, cashews, and pistachios, was associated with a 21 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks, strokes, and atrial fibrillation, an 11 percent reduced risk of dying from cancer, and a 22 percent lower risk of premature death from any cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The benefits likely come from their unique combination of healthy fats, fiber, and antioxidants that improve cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and support blood vessel function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On top of being rich in vitamins that protect cells from oxidative damage, such as vitamin E, almonds contain monounsaturated fats that lower ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has suggested that eating a handful of almonds with a meal can reduce blood sugar spikes by up to 30 percent, an effect comparable to a diabetes drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These findings support almonds as a functional food for oxidation management,’ the researchers said, adding that more rigorously controlled studies are required before implementing broad dietary guidelines to include more almonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Research has suggested that eating a handful of almonds with a meal can reduce blood sugar spikes by up to 30 percent (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers did not examine toxicity, but overeating almonds can have drawbacks. Two heaping handfuls of almonds contain around seven grams of fiber, around 27 percent of the daily recommended amount. Too much too fast could cause bloating, gas or diarrhea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases, overeating almonds can cause vitamin E toxicity if the person is also taking a vitamin E supplement or a multivitamin containing vitamin E. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin E acts as a blood thinner. Very high doses may increase bruising or bleeding risk, especially if a person is taking blood-thinning medication, such as warfarin or aspirin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who are susceptible to kidney stones should also moderate their almond consumption. Almonds contain oxalates. The body converts excess oxalates into crystals that may form stones, especially when combined with low fluid intake or other risk factors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, a person would have to eat magnitudes more almonds than what is typical.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 400mg vitamin E supplement plus 60g almonds, 15mg, is safe, reaching the 1,000mg upper limit would require eating 5.3 lbs (2.4kg) of almonds daily alongside the supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, research shows the oxalate content in typical almond portions poses little risk when consumed as part of a balanced diet with adequate hydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 21:28:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNVjFGYWo4VXpBSUZoTVlaakpLeDJTYXJQSzAwNkxCNFZOcmtHeVZSYnBQN1M1S3JJdTI5NjhnUTdwMGdWdVVZOFBrT3RSMTdXaDZNSnhEX2phdHRoUEdHcUJGTHFyMzZiVHRhYURQZ0Z4LXZSNzFhak5ta1dLbFQwQ2dwRUdWZ0Zmc2xFQ1dkNGFlMVQ3TXNOTENfcTNXekp4cHZfNkJR0gGrAUFVX3lxTFBWVnJKZG8tb3BZekdVT3c0YzBEYkdmVGVWV1EzLUFHTkRaWXI2ZFdXYWlDWlBnSUQ3blBTeUJQTWpVUzhfb0daRlk5VW5uTEc1ZTIxMTdGVlZ4dDNRdll2UUxpMUpiREFWdHlndXdLaW5KVWxnc05WbVh6cGhTVXYyLUphNEpjUHRXc1hodEdQUE5VY1pjQVM3YV9PcEtMTG9uanc4VE4wQUUwbw</guid></item><item><title>州政府表示，新泽西州居民感染疟疾可能是几十年来首例“本土”病例- NJ.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QSHR6ZSSZFCT5GJCF4MC2KTYFA"&gt;Investigators are trying to determine whether a Morris County resident infected with malaria represents the first locally-acquired case of the disease in New Jersey since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2A6GIR2SI5HDPBYGQ3UILM6JH4"&gt;The resident, who has no international travel history, was not identified.

              &lt;p&gt;A woman’s supposed pregnancy turned out to be something much stranger. In a recent report from her doctors, they detail how the woman had developed an incredibly rare form of ovarian cancer that mimicked the symptoms of pregnancy, even causing a positive pregnancy test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors in India &lt;a href="https://www.oncoscience.us/article/622/text/"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; the case of mistaken identity earlier this July in the journal Oncoscience. After first suspecting the woman had an ectopic pregnancy, the doctors instead discovered a large and rare type of tumor in her right ovary. Thankfully, the cancer was removed before it spread elsewhere, and the woman seems to have responded well to treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A pregnancy that wasn’t&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the 36-year-old woman visited doctors three months into having intermittent bouts of heavy menstrual bleeding. She tested positive for a pregnancy on a urine test, and when doctors performed a physical examination, they felt a solid mass along her abdomen consistent with having a 20-week-old fetus. An initial ultrasound appeared to show that the woman was experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, a condition where the embryo forms outside of the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube (ectopic pregnancies are inherently non-viable). After conducting more extensive imaging, they found that she actually had cancer in her right ovary, most likely a choriocarcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24863-choriocarcinoma"&gt;Choriocarcinomas&lt;/a&gt; are tumors mainly formed from the cells that become the placenta during a pregnancy. It’s an especially dangerous cancer since the tumors tend to grow quickly and spread to other parts of the body. The woman’s doctors soon performed surgery to assess the progression of her cancer and to treat it if possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They successfully removed the tumor, along with the woman’s uterus, ovaries, and surrounding lymph nodes. Though relatively large, the tumor was still in an early stage of development and hadn’t metastasized. When the doctors looked closer, though, they found her cancer was even weirder than first thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;‘Exceedingly rare’&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Choriocarcinomas are usually gestational, meaning they’re linked to pregnancy; oftentimes, the tumor will even arise from an abnormal and non-viable pregnancy. But the woman’s cancer was a non-gestational ovarian choriocarcinoma (NGOC), which only accounts for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35328112/"&gt;0.6%&lt;/a&gt; of all reported ovarian germ cell tumors (a germ cell being the actual egg). What’s more, the cancer was a pure NGOC, an “exceedingly rare” subtype made completely out of germ cells and not any other kinds of tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;An image of the woman’s tumor, as well as her uterus and a benign ovarian cyst, can be seen &lt;a href="https://www.oncoscience.us/output/cache/622/F3.png"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but be warned, it’s not for the faint of heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While these cancers aren’t tied to pregnancy, they do cause the body to produce high levels of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Women also produce high levels of hCG during pregnancy, and some tests detect pregnancy through measuring hCG, explaining the woman’s positive result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“NGOC is a rare, distinct, and highly aggressive tumor that predominantly affects young, reproductive-aged women,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, in this case, the cancer appears to have been caught early enough in time. Following surgery, the woman was placed on chemotherapy. And her most recent tests showed that her hCG level had returned to normal, indicating a complete treatment response, according to the doctors. She will need to have regular follow-up tests, including CT imaging, to make sure the cancer isn’t staging an unwelcome comeback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fine particulate matter, which is about 30 times smaller than the width of a strand of human hair, can seep indoors from automobiles and factories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Paraphrasing below: Breathing in traffic pollution can put stress on the body by raising heart rate and tightening blood vessels. Over time, it can also damage the arteries, which increases the risk of high blood pressure, according to &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/karishma-patwa-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Karishma Patwa, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified cardiologist at Manhattan Cardiology.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Air pollution is often discussed in terms of outdoor sources, but cooking and smoking indoors also add to particulate matter pollution, said &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/sarath-raju/2704329" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sarath Raju, MD, MPH&lt;/a&gt;, a pulmonologist and assistant professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People in the U.S. spend about 90% of their time indoors. Exposure to indoor air pollutants can cause headaches, dizziness, eye irritation, respiratory diseases, heart issues, and cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Older adults and people with underlying heart issues, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol levels have a higher risk of cardiovascular problems from particulate matter air pollution.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting an air purifier is one way to reduce indoor air pollution.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;"Even if you don't live near a high traffic area, I would consider this a strategy, particularly in vulnerable populations who may face greater risk for adverse cardiovascular effects or have greater risk for lung disease from my air pollution exposure," Raju said.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you decide to get an air purifier for your home, look for one with a HEPA filter, which is effective against most harmful particles in the air.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Carbon filter can also reduce certain gases, so finding a purifier with both is ideal, Raju said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; He added that other ways to lower indoor air pollution exposure include not smoking inside, keeping windows closed during high-pollution days, and using an induction stove instead of a gas stove.&lt;br&gt;

A 2023 study of nearly 1,000 adults by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine compared the rate of cognitive decline over a three-year period between people who did and didn't receive hearing aids.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hearing aids could slash the risk of dementia by almost two thirds, new findings suggest (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers found those who received hearing aids had a 48 percent reduction in the rate of cognitive decline compared with people who didn't get the devices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In response, Professor Frank Lin, of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health, said: 'These results provide compelling evidence that treating hearing loss is a powerful tool to protect cognitive function in later life, and possibly, over the long term, delay a dementia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But any cognitive benefits of treating age-related hearing loss are likely to vary depending on an individual's risk of cognitive decline.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with hearing loss putting an increased workload on the brain, Professor Lin believes that it can also make people feel more isolated and less socially engaged, which can contribute to dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'When you have hearing loss, you may not be as socially engaged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You may become more lonely or withdrawn. One thing we know about risk of dementia and cognitive decline is that if people don't remain engaged with cognitively stimulating activities, it is not good for the brain.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hearing loss has been strongly linked to neurogenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, but it has so far been unclear whether it is a symptom or one of the causes behind the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Age-related hearing loss is extremely common, with an estimated one in three people over 60 in the US having some degree of hearing loss, with women at a slightly higher risk than men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, only around a third of this population use hearing aids.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, over 7 million individuals aged 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's disease with this number projected to nearly double to 13 million by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the US, over 7 million individuals aged 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's disease with this number projected to nearly double to 13 million by 2050&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought to be caused by a build-up of amyloid and tau in the brain, which clump together and from plaques and tangles that make it harder for the brain to work properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, the brain struggles to cope with this damage and dementia symptoms develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Memory problems, thinking and reasoning difficulties and language problems are common early symptoms of the condition, which then worsen over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is more&lt;span&gt; prevalent among females, with around two-thirds of cases occurring in women.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The increased risk among women is attributed to a combination of factors, including women's longer life expectancy, hormonal changes associated with menopause, genetic predispositions, and lifestyle influences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other risks for dementia include high blood pressure, lack of physical activity, smoking, alcohol use and uncontrolled diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids can be purchased directly from retail stores or online without a prescription or professional fitting by an audiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, audiologists can also provide prescription-strength hearing aids, which may be necessary for more severe hearing loss or for those who prefer a customized fitting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Age-related hearing loss is extremely common, with an estimated one in three people over 60 in the US having some degree of hearing loss, with women at a slightly higher risk than men. However, only around a third of this population use hearing aids (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Many warning signs of dementia are often confused with normal aging. Common early symptoms include forgetfulness, repeating themselves, sudden changes in mood, inability to speak, and personality changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite them being readily available, many people still don't seek help or wear hearing aids because of the perceived stigma around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, with technological advancements and a growing preference for sleek, discreet designs, hearing aids are becoming increasingly popular. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hearing aids market is expected to reach $45.68 billion by 2031, an increase from $28.75 billion in 2024, which experts say is largely due to an aging population.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has suggested hearing loss can contribute to a faster rate of brain wasting as well as prompt social isolation – another known risk factor of mental decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists also believe it may also make the brain work harder to the detriment of other mental functions like thinking and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The cumulative incidence of long COVID among reinfected and non-reinfected participants was 11.1% and 8.2% in the post-index year, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those vaccinated between first infection and index faced lower risks of long COVID from reinfection than those only vaccinated prior to their first infection, suggesting that more recent vaccinations may lower the risk of long COVID following reinfections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Among patients similar to those who got COVID-19 again, reinfections resulted in a 35% increase in the risk of developing long COVID (risk ratio [RR], 1.35; absolute risk difference [aRD], 0.029). The finding held across most stratifications, including sex and timing and severity of first infection, but differed by age-group. The youngest groups had lower aRDs (ages 18 to 25 years, 0.011; 26 to 35, 0.019) than older groups (36 to 50, 0.034; 51 to 65, 0.037; 66 and older, 0.036).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The subanalysis found overlapping risk ratios for most vaccination groups, but risk was generally lower among those vaccinated after their first infection but before the index date (RR, 1.19) and before the first infection and pre-index date (RR, 1.21). RRs were higher for participants vaccinated before their first infection but not pre-index (RR, 1.45) or not at all (RR, 1.33).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Those vaccinated between first infection and index faced lower risks of long COVID from reinfection than those only vaccinated prior to their first infection, suggesting that more recent vaccinations may lower the risk of long COVID following reinfections," the study authors wrote. "However, this effect was not consistent across all groups."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Vaccinated individuals tended to be older with more comorbidities and utilization, resulting in higher overall incidences of long COVID," they added. "More research is needed to discern how vaccination modulates the likelihood of a reinfection to lead to long COVID."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Using the gold-standard Navigation Guide review method, the team analyzed 46 studies with over 100,000 participants, finding that stronger studies more consistently showed a connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the evidence does not prove causation, it highlights biological mechanisms such as oxidative stress and hormone disruption that may affect fetal brain development.

Analysis by the Mount Sinai-led team of 46 studies incorporating data from more than 100,000 participants across multiple countries challenges this perception and underscores the need for both caution and further study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Navigation Guide Systematic Review methodology is a gold-standard framework for synthesizing and evaluating environmental health data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach allows researchers to assess and rate each study’s risk of bias, such as selective reporting of the outcomes or incomplete data, as well as the strength of the evidence and the quality of the studies individually and collectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that higher-quality studies are more likely to show a link between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and increased risks of autism and ADHD,” said Diddier Prada, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Population Health Science and Policy, and Environmental Medicine and Climate Science, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the widespread use of this medication, even a small increase in risk could have major public health implications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper also explores biological mechanisms that could explain the association between acetaminophen use and these disorders. Acetaminophen is known to cross the placental barrier and may trigger oxidative stress, disrupt hormones, and cause epigenetic changes that interfere with fetal brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study does not show that acetaminophen directly causes neurodevelopmental disorders, the research team’s findings strengthen the evidence for a connection and raise concerns about current clinical practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers call for cautious, time-limited use of acetaminophen during pregnancy under medical supervision; updated clinical guidelines to better balance the benefits and risks; and further research to confirm these findings and identify safer alternatives for managing pain and fever in expectant mothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pregnant women should not stop taking medication without consulting their doctors,” Dr. Prada emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Untreated pain or fever can also harm the baby. Our study highlights the importance of discussing the safest approach with health care providers and considering non-drug options whenever possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With diagnoses of autism and ADHD increasing worldwide, these findings have significant implications for public health policy, clinical guidelines, and patient education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the urgent need for pharmaceutical innovation to provide safer alternatives for pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles; University of Massachusetts Lowell; and Harvard T.H.

Due to substantial heterogeneity, we opted for a qualitative synthesis, consistent with the Navigation Guide’s focus on environmental health evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified 46 studies for inclusion in our analysis. Of these, 27 studies reported positive associations (significant links to NDDs), 9 showed null associations (no significant link), and 4 indicated negative associations (protective effects). Higher-quality studies were more likely to show positive associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the majority of the studies reported positive associations of prenatal acetaminophen use with ADHD, ASD, or NDDs in offspring, with risk-of-bias and strength-of-evidence ratings informing the overall synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our analyses using the Navigation Guide thus support evidence consistent with an association between acetaminophen exposure during pregnancy and increased incidence of NDDs. Appropriate and immediate steps should be taken to advise pregnant women to limit acetaminophen consumption to protect their offspring’s neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 19:32:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5lMzN1aTc5WjRfWHpKWEU0VWphWF9Ed3VvekhGdlA3X0xrVFBCUnVJeE92bnRtQjBFbWl1ajJERThoMmlkUzR6aGppU1FUNWFIdWp6am5GejJnczBjck1TWkxZZWNPZ3NXZ2c4aW1B</guid></item><item><title>西德克萨斯州麻疹疫情已经结束- WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE5rbk5DSFRXSTZhWHNJZWJLR19sbGdidTAyOUdORUZIVGJIZUJBQkRMTXRZWTVIMTBWclBqWlhxWlMtV1poRXBzVWZUZUM1VkJPVElsX1pRZUE3cjVfYjNlLXc0dTVVLWZiYkZCZzFQQzRlZ05HUmpzTnRR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/measles-cases-are-rising-other-diseases-could-follow/"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in Texas that has affected 762 people has now ended, according to an announcement Monday by the Texas Department of State Health Services. The agency says it has been more than 42 days since a new case was reported in any of the counties that previously showed evidence of ongoing transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The outbreak has contributed to the worst year for measles cases in the United States in more than 30 years. As of August 5, the most recent update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a total of 1,356 confirmed measles cases &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;have been reported across the country this year&lt;/a&gt;. For comparison, there were just 285 measles cases in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The Texas outbreak began in January in a rural Mennonite community with low vaccination rates. More than two-thirds of the state’s reported cases were in children, and two children in Texas died of the virus. Both were unvaccinated and had no known underlying conditions. Over the course of the outbreak, a total of 99 people were hospitalized, representing 13 percent of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/this-is-how-measles-can-kill-texas-new-mexico-outbreak-vaccines-vitamin-a/"&gt;temporarily weaken the immune system&lt;/a&gt;, leaving individuals vulnerable to secondary infections such as pneumonia. In rare cases, it can also lead to swelling of the brain and long-term neurological damage. It can also cause pregnancy complications, such as premature birth and babies with low birth weight. The best way to prevent the disease is the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. One dose of the vaccine is 93 percent effective against measles while two doses is 97 percent effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;A measles outbreak is considered over after 42 days if no new cases are discovered because it is double the disease’s maximum incubation period—the longest time it can take between when a person is exposed to the virus and when they develop symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The CDC defines an outbreak as three or more related cases. The West Texas outbreak has been linked to cases in neighboring states, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/measles-cases-are-soaring-in-mexico/"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While the Texas outbreak has ended, measles cases are still being reported elsewhere in the country. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, 40 other states have reported cases, and a total of 32 US outbreaks have been reported in 2025, compared with 16 outbreaks in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The ongoing outbreaks put the country’s measles elimination status at risk. The designation means there is no ongoing domestic spread of measles for longer than 12 months. The US achieved that status in 2000 after years of increasing vaccination rates but &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/can-us-measles-outbreaks-be-stopped/"&gt;almost lost it in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when measles cases swept through undervaccinated Orthodox Jewish communities in New York for much of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As vaccination rates continue to decline in the US, public health researchers warn that outbreaks of measles and other diseases are likely. One recent peer-reviewed paper found that at current state-level vaccination rates, measles could &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/scientists-say-measles-likely-to-become-endemic-in-us-polio-diphtheria-rubella/"&gt;reestablish itself and become endemic again&lt;/a&gt; within the next two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 18:30:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE5rbk5DSFRXSTZhWHNJZWJLR19sbGdidTAyOUdORUZIVGJIZUJBQkRMTXRZWTVIMTBWclBqWlhxWlMtV1poRXBzVWZUZUM1VkJPVElsX1pRZUE3cjVfYjNlLXc0dTVVLWZiYkZCZzFQQzRlZ05HUmpzTnRR</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州的疫苗豁免请求在7月份激增，因为一些专家担心会有更多家庭选择退出- ABC13休斯顿</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxOZUtFek4tclRwZllkcmNIeDR4bHNkZDhEc3ZpTXlPMDNaOTNRTWRnVzNUVHA2NDVQVnFZcmM1N0JoU0JxbXNLZ1dFUlppX0NzSVVHVDJ2NWx3dmhiQnRTVEJHX2NNWjFHdWp1OHMyY0JpVzNTNURPaXBsUV9vVnRmdmxtZzcwQlJsZEpNY2M5SEtMOTNIRkU2eHppWlJYNTVJMEV0czJGYlRDS1FOWVRsM1hn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Texas school districts are coming back from summer with a rising number of parents asking for vaccine exemption forms and a new law that will make those documents even easier to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Combined with funding cuts to public vaccination programs, chilling effects of immigration policies on health care, and the wearying battle by school nurses to balance parental consent and overall student body health, Texas schools are on track to have the lowest vaccination rates in decades if exemption rates continue to climb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I do think that there is a problem - period - that is worse than we have known about previously," said Terri Burke, executive director of The Immunization Partnership, which advocates for public policies that support increased access to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Since 2018, the requests to the Texas Department of State Health Services for a vaccine exemption form have doubled from 45,900 to more than 93,000 in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In July, ahead of the new school year, the state received 17,197 requests for a vaccine exemption form, 36% higher than the number reported in July 2023. Because each requestor can have forms for up to eight individuals, the number of children those forms covered also soared - 23,231 in July 2023 compared to 30,596 in July 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Now, as some public health departments indicate there are drops in the number of poorer children coming to them to get vaccinated during the summer months, and a new Sept. 1 law that will make the vaccination exemption form downloadable instead of it being mailed, vaccine experts fear herd immunity will be tougher to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Rebecca Hardy, president of Texans for Vaccine Choice, which successfully lobbied for the easier exemption process, suggests the fears are overblown. She said she hasn't seen an increase in interest in exemption forms and insists that her organization exists to "support all parents, regardless of how they vaccinate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Vaccination picture for Texas &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Vaccination effectiveness relies on having enough people immunized so that those with compromised immune systems and cannot vaccinate are protected. The gold standard used by public health officials and schools is to have 95% of school-aged children vaccinated. A clear statistical picture of this school year's vaccination rates will likely not be available for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;While vaccination rates for Texas kindergarteners hover around 93%, pockets of 80% or lower exist, with some school districts reporting a high exemption rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For example, in the Austin school district during the 2024-25 school year, 79.6% of kindergarteners were up to date on the vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, a drop from 2020 when 96% were vaccinated. And in Gaines County, where the West Texas measles outbreak began in January, 77% of kindergartners were vaccinated the same year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Texas leads the nation with the most kindergartners - more than 25,000 - who were not fully vaccinated against measles, followed by Florida and California, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released last month. The Texas measles kindergarten vaccination rate of 93.24% is the lowest it's been since at least 2011, ranking the state 18th nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Vaccine supporters, such as Burke, told lawmakers earlier this year that legislation to make the vaccine exemption form easier to obtain would inevitably drive down vaccination rates for school-age children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In recent weeks, Burke said her organization has had disheartening conversations with pediatricians and public health officials who say vaccine skepticism has worsened. "Their frustration is that they can't even bring up the subject with parents."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the Waco district, more than 98% of kindergartners were vaccinated, and less than 1% of students filed exemptions. Lana Scully, a school nurse in Waco, said even with the new downloadable option going into effect in September, she anticipates her rate staying low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The main nuisance for parents wasn't that exemption forms had to be mailed to them by the Texas Department of State Health Services, she said. Parents didn't want to have to take the extra step of getting it notarized. That requirement will not change when the new downloadable form is made available next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"You know there are two inconveniences of it, well, actually three," Scully explained. "One is you have to go to the health department, pick it up. One is that you have to get it notarized. And the last one is that they're only good for two years. So that kind of weeds out who's got the strong feelings versus who doesn't want to get to the doctor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scully said she has no issue with parents wanting fewer vaccinations for their child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If somebody really has a strong conviction, great," Scully said. "That's your strong conviction, and you're doing what's best for you and your family ... But if it's just, I don't feel like taking my kid to the doctor 'cause I'm sitting on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune, it's a lot easier to go get the shots."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;School challenges driving up vaccine delinquencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Funding cuts for schools have meant fewer school nurses and health aides and a crushing workload for those who remain. There's the constant managing of emergency health equipment, maintaining students' daily medication regimens, and caring for more kids with chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Finally, there's the year-round chase of parents for their child's vaccination records - or vaccine exemption forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It was a snap decision, but it was oncoming," said Chanthini Thomas, a school nurse who abruptly retired from Bellaire High School in the Houston school district after 25 years in the profession. "This past year was the worst year I've ever had in school nursing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Historically, Texas public schools have been a stopgap to compel vaccinations. Students are required to be vaccinated to attend school unless they have a notarized exemption form or face being sent home until they have either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As larger urban districts combat suburban ones for students, Texas school nurses are often hearing from districts, including Houston, not to let vaccination requirements prevent students from attending school. If every student without the required paperwork were denied entry to class, schools would lose out on their basic allotment funds for each student enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"There are some superintendents that will say, 'All kids come to school. I don't care if they've got their vaccines or not,'" said Karen Schwind, a past president of the Texas Association of School Nurses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the 2024-25 school year, 2.7% of kindergarteners did not have records of the required doses of the measles vaccine and lacked an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I have kids, been hounding them for two years," Thomas recalled. "All I can do is send letters, call parents, and beg."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Houston school district confirmed to The Texas Tribune in April that "at this time, we are not excluding students from learning based on vaccine status." District officials more recently said their policy has not changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Hardy, with Texans for Vaccine Choice, said her group "applauds any school that recognizes that being militant about vaccine paperwork simply makes no sense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Whether families submit shot records, vaccine exemptions, or a mix of both, it's still just paperwork," she said. All of those things are not a "measure of a student's health and certainly irrelevant to the core mission of schools: to educate, not operate as ad hoc health clinics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Public health departments report some vaccination dips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Each year, many of the state's school-age children who have no health insurance or who are covered by Medicaid turn to public health departments for their vaccinations. Dallas and Austin public health officials have reported some decreases in visits to summer vaccination clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We typically have, like, you know, big lines, and the waiting room is packed. Our whole lobby is packed," said Dr. Phil Huang, the director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. "This year it has not been that way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Huang and his staff believe threats of ICE arrests and deportations have pushed more undocumented children and their parents to stay away from vaccination. In Texas, there are an estimated 111,000 undocumented children, all of whom do not qualify for state Medicaid health insurance coverage, attending school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Funding cuts have also contributed to the reduction of vaccinations, particularly among the uninsured and Medicaid-insured populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;During the pandemic, local health departments received a surge in federal funding. That boost allowed local health departments to "right-size" their lean immunization programs for the first time in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We had 20 to 25 team members, so we were able to see well more than 20 people (daily) or even conduct multiple clinics at a time," said Chris Crookham, program manager of the immunization unit at Austin Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Today, public health officials are now scaling back after the federal government put an early end to such funding. "Now the team is down to just seven people, and so we're capping our clinics at 20 clients only," Crookham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In June, Austin Public Health and other local health departments braced for even more cuts, up to $28 million more in federal immunization cuts.

That said, those cells were more awakened than they had been — and were therefore more likely to multiply in the future. In theory, each future infection would increase the risk that dormant cancer cells could wake up and proliferate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s worth noting that the study was conducted in rodents, and while a similar effect may occur in humans, this has not definitely been proven, Kollipara said. In addition, the study only examined cancer cells in the lungs, so it’s unclear if the infections impacted cells located in other parts of the body, she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might COVID and the flu have this effect on cancer cells?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you contract the flu or COVID, your body releases inflammatory &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24585-cytokines" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cytokines" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a3487ae4b03709c085c04d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24585-cytokines" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cytokines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that help fight the pathogen and heal damaged tissue.

More research is needed to understand how viral infections impact cancer recurrence, but this report offers some important clues as to why breast cancer recurrence has increased since the COVID pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This study may lead to more research to determine if this type of immune response in humans has contributed to that finding,” Forrester said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean for breast cancer survivors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Forrester, the new findings reinforce how important it is for cancer survivors and people with cancer to take extra precautions to avoid getting the flu or COVID. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She recommends staying up to date with your vaccines and washing your hands thoroughly when you’re out and about. If you develop respiratory symptoms, book an appointment with a health care provider.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A healthy neck circumference to waist circumference ratio is generally considered to be less than 0.5; meaning your waist circumference should be less than twice your neck circumference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AFib is associated with an increased risk of death and can potentially shorten lifespan. A 2018 study found people with Afib had an up to four times increased risk of mortality compared to the general population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While modern treatments have improved outcomes, AFib still carries a significant risk, particularly due to complications like stroke and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For measurement of neck circumference, participants were instructed to stand straight with the measuring tape around the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both neck and waist circumference were measured to the nearest quarter inch. Standardized protocols were used to measure height and weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that the correlation between neck circumference and increased risk of AFib persisted after taking into account traditional body fat measurements such as BMI, waist circumference, height and weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say a larger neck circumference is a proxy for excess upper body subcutaneous fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This type of fat, particularly in the upper body, can be a major source of circulating free fatty acids in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Increased levels of free fatty acids are linked with insulin resistance and an imbalance of lipids in the blood, which can lead to the development of cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers from Boston University found that the correlation between neck circumference and increased risk of AFib persisted after taking into account traditional body fat measurements such as BMI, waist circumference, height and weight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another study out of Israel in 2019 presented similar findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis included 302 patients with the average age being around 62 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the participants' height was accounted for, they found a high neck circumference 'significantly correlated with poor long-term outcome'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the complaints they found among the subjects with thicker necks included diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found the risk of these ailments was 2.3 times higher for those with larger neck circumferences compared to those with slimmer necks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a 2022 study by researchers based out of Shanghai found that neck circumference was 'significantly associated' with the risk of future cardiovascular events in middle-aged and elderly populations and was a better predictor in men.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multicenter French study led by Rennes University Hospital reports potential benefits of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), with statistically significant reductions in HS-related scores at six months and at last follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;HS is a chronic skin condition that causes painful lumps and lesions in areas like the armpits, groin, and buttocks. Skin inflammation causes hair follicles to get blocked and the nearby sweat glands become inflamed, causing the lesions. The majority of HS patients are overweight or have obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysfunctional adipose tissue contributes to the pathophysiology by overproducing proinflammatory adipokines and cytokines, while reducing anti-inflammatory adiponectin. Weight loss, through diet or obesity surgery, has a beneficial effect on HS in most patients. Meaningful reductions remain a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, originally developed for type 2 diabetes, have demonstrated major efficacy in inducing weight loss and could also possess anti-inflammatory properties, prompting investigation into their impact on HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists in Hidradenitis Suppurativa," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2837172" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Dermatology&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study to assess the impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists on HS outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 66 patients with HS from 15 centers, median follow-up while taking GLP-1 receptor agonists was 18.5 months. Semaglutide was taken by 48 patients, dulaglutide by 13, and liraglutide by five. Adults with HS confirmed by a dermatologist who were receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists for three months or longer were included. Outcomes were assessed at initiation, six months, and discontinuation or last consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The median age was 46.0 (37.5–54.0) years; 58% were women. The median BMI was 39.4 (32.9–45.0). Diabetes was present in 86%. Ongoing HS treatment at initiation occurred in 35 patients (53%), with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/antibiotic+therapy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antibiotic therapy&lt;/a&gt; 23, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/broad-spectrum+antibiotics/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;broad-spectrum antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; three, and biologic nine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At six months, 54% of patients had a reduction in HS with 12% showing a 2-point or higher reduction based on the HS Physician's Global Assessment scale. By last consultation, 62% observed reductions, with 32% at or above the 2-point scale with flare reductions in 67% of patients, and decreased pain in 60%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible mechanisms for the results include a direct effect of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/weight+loss/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; and obesity-related low-grade systemic inflammation, an anti-inflammatory effect by lowering &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/inflammatory+cytokines/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;inflammatory cytokines&lt;/a&gt; and attenuating Toll-like receptor-mediated inflammation in response to bacteria, with potential promotion of skin healing by reducing matrix metalloproteinases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors state that GLP-1 receptor agonists may offer promise for patients with HS and obesity and potentially for patients without obesity through immunological effects. Randomized &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are needed to confirm the role of GLP-1 receptor agonists in HS management.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8gwwz000h3b7an0ts5e4e@published"&gt;My husband died suddenly at age 71. We were married almost 40 years. He was retired and had a pension and social security, both of which went away when he died. Because of my own chronic health conditions, most of our financial planning imagined that I would die first and he would be financially secure. Man plans, God laughs. I am financially stable but must keep working to maintain my household.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8gx4h000i3b7adxnnjycf@published"&gt;My husband has two living brothers. One is financially unstable with his own health issues. Throughout our marriage, we were able to throw some significant sums and the occasional emergency money his way. I continue to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="121" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8gx65000j3b7alkldbwnj@published"&gt;The other brother seems fine but has had his own struggles. It seems that he had an expectation of an inheritance after my husband died. Is that a thing? If we had both died, there was a will that would have given each of his siblings and their children money. The day after my husband died, he and his family asked for his car. I said no, and traded in my 10 year-old car and his 11-year-old car for a new car for me. Now this family, who lives nearby, has distanced themselves from me and I only see them at the holiday gatherings. I don’t have warm fuzzy feeling for them now, but I’m wondering if I did something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="28" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8gxml000m3b7aeui5q9k7@published"&gt;Wow! I’m marveling at the gall of a brother who would ask a new, grieving widow for her husband’s car the day after his death. That’s some chutzpah.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8gxrc000n3b7azogp0m0q@published"&gt;There’s a fair amount of ignorance about what happens when someone dies. For example, television shows have conditioned many people to believe there is an “estate reveal,” where loved ones or strangers come together to hear a reading of the will. That doesn’t often happen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8gxwl000o3b7awnlypuq7@published"&gt;If there is a will, the named executor will start the process of managing the estate, which may include filing the will with probate court, and finding all of the assets. Eventually, once any debts incurred by the estate are paid, the executor will distribute the assets to beneficiaries named in the will. The process can take months or even years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8gy1i000p3b7agniyjb2w@published"&gt;According to Caring.com’s &lt;a href="https://www.caring.com/resources/wills-survey"&gt;2025 survey&lt;/a&gt;, 76 percent of Americans don’t have a will. When someone dies intestate, or without a will, assets must be probated and a court decides who gets what, and manages the distribution of assets according to state law. If the decedent has minor children, then the court will decide who will have custody of those minor children and who will manage any assets left for their care.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8gy64000q3b7a5s8nsblq@published"&gt;So, back to you. Did you do something wrong? Not from where I sit. In your case, your late husband has two living brothers, each of whom are struggling. While the one brother may have thought your late husband’s will left him something, asking for his car the day after he died makes me think he isn’t at all concerned about you. Telling him no was the easiest and best thing you could have done. The fact that they’ve essentially cut off ties indicates there perhaps wasn’t as much to the relationship as your husband may have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8gyas000r3b7a4nagsici@published"&gt;It’s kind of you to continue to support the other brother, although if you can’t afford it once you retire, you could walk that back a bit. Since you have been financially supporting him for a longer period, it would be thoughtful to give him some warning, so he can make other arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8ihoo000w3b7arwp1buem@published"&gt;Near where I live, there’s a beautiful woodland area where I regularly walk my dogs. It’s a protected site, part of a former mining zone that’s now been reclaimed by nature. The terrain is unique and scenic—full of bumps, hills, small cliffs, and shaded by mature trees. According to local regulations, it’s off-limits to activities like motocross, which are both dangerous and disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8ihoo000x3b7azkcgsfnd@published"&gt;Unfortunately, some local riders seem to ignore this. Despite complaints from residents, the local council has shown little interest in enforcement. So, I’ve taken a bit of initiative. Using fallen trees (brought down by storms or age—not cut by me), I’ve placed them across some of the popular trails. They’re always placed in visible spots, so as not to cause accidents, but the idea is to break up the speed and rhythm of motocross riders, discouraging them from using the trails altogether. Anecdotally, it seems to be working: the forest is much more peaceful now&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8ihoo000y3b7a2cysx6xk@published"&gt;However, here’s my dilemma. These barriers also inconvenience other legitimate users of the forest—like mountain bikers and possibly even fellow walkers. While the trees can still be stepped over or climbed over (no athletic feats required), I acknowledge it creates a disruption. My wife thinks I should stop and restore the paths. I’m torn between trying to protect the forest’s character and peace, and respecting all users’ access.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="22" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8ihop000z3b7a19n4axc7@published"&gt;So: should I clear the trails again? Or is a little passive resistance justified in the name of preserving this quiet place?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="17" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8ihop00123b7afhyodtxo@published"&gt;I’m with your wife. Stop what you’re doing and return the trails to their former, natural state.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8ihop00133b7ayhmogq2m@published"&gt;I’m not an attorney, but you may be running afoul of several types of laws in the name of keeping the trails “peaceful.” If this is public land, placing obstacles on trails could constitute vandalism or interference with public property, even using “natural” materials. You might also be exposing yourself to a liability claim, if someone gets injured because of these barriers, which are intentionally placed. Many jurisdictions have specific laws against blocking trails or public pathways, regardless of good intentions. And finally, taking enforcement into your own hands when official authorities exist (even ineffective ones) can sometimes violate laws about interfering with governmental functions.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8itaz00193b7ap009fd93@published"&gt;You’re better off taking video or images of people who are misusing the trail and pressing the local council to regulate trails more actively. You might also approach, and offer to work with, local environmental groups about preserving the peaceful nature of the trail system. Can a system be developed where certain hours of specific days or weeks are reserved for motocross activities? Finally, can you work with the local authorities to put up better signage so that everyone knows the rules, regulations and fines that could be assessed?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8ihoq00143b7aygyom01w@published"&gt;While the woodland area is clearly worth protecting, actively harming the trails in the name of protecting the environment could put you in serious legal jeopardy. Try to find another way to achieve the same, peaceful result.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh7gke5000qxtkvtb0tjoun@published"&gt;I’ve decided to basically cut off my daughter once she’s finished with high school, which will be just over five months from now. She didn’t do anything wrong, I’m not eager to be rid of her, and I could easily continue to provide for her basic needs, but I won’t. I myself lived with my parents into my 20s, but I feel like this did me no favors, and I’ve come to believe in “sink or swim” and “hard knock” life philosophies. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/01/cutting-off-daughter-personal-finance-advice.html"&gt;So please don’t argue about this decision.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These animals are likely carrying a germ known as the squirrel fibroma virus (SFV). Though the condition is scary-looking, squirrels usually recover from the infection, and it poses no threat to humans.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SFV was first &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13037878/"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; in the 1950s and is a poxvirus, meaning it’s related to the virus that causes smallpox in humans. That said, it’s a part of a genus, leporipoxvirus, whose only &lt;a href="https://ictv.global/report/chapter/poxviridae/poxviridae/leporipoxvirus#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20evidence%20that%20leporipoxviruses%20are%20zoonotic%2C%20but%20myxoma%20virus%20exhibits%20tropism%20for%20tumor%20cells%20from%20outside%20the%20rabbit%20species."&gt;known natural hosts&lt;/a&gt; are squirrels and rabbits. The infection causes benign tumors, or fibromas, to form across the squirrel’s skin, particularly on its head or limbs.&lt;/p&gt;

It predominantly affects gray squirrels, though it can infect &lt;a href="https://ilacadofsci.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/108-07MS991Final.pdf"&gt;other species&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SFV can be a dangerous disease for squirrels. The tumors can potentially metastasize to the animal’s internal organs or become so large and numerous on the skin that they cause secondary infections or even hamper the animal’s vision and ability to eat. But according to the &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/managing-resources/wildlife/wildlife-disease/wdm/squirrel-pox"&gt;Michigan Department of Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt;, the infection typically doesn’t cause any obvious signs of illness outside of the skin fibromas. And in areas where it is common, like Michigan, the virus hasn’t had any effect on the overall squirrel population. In &lt;a href="https://cwhl.vet.cornell.edu/disease/fibromas"&gt;most cases&lt;/a&gt;, the fibromas regress over time, and the animal recovers completely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re a hunter with a hankering for squirrel meat, you can also rest easy. Even SFV-infected squirrels are apparently safe for consumption, according to the Michigan DNR. Still, the average person shouldn’t try to touch or handle infected squirrels, or really any wildlife for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;On a little side note, SFV is sometimes called the squirrel pox virus. But this is also the nickname for a different pox virus (the &lt;a href="https://ictv.global/report/chapter/poxviridae/poxviridae/sciuripoxvirus"&gt;squirrelpox virus&lt;/a&gt;) that predominantly affects squirrels in the UK. Adding to the confusion, researchers have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23307385/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5621524/"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; potential squirrel pox viruses in countries like Canada and Germany. All of which is to say: It feels like there should be a cleaner labeling system for these squirrel-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;The countdown to the return to school is on for many major Triangle-area
traditional school systems, including Wake County and Durham County. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Pediatricians say now is a critical time for parents to make
plans to bring their children to see their family doctor for vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Department of Human Services Kindergarten
Immunization Dashboard reports 93% of kindergarteners statewide were up to date
on required vaccines, &lt;a href="https://www.dph.ncdhhs.gov/programs/epidemiology/immunization/data/kindergarten-dashboard"&gt;as
of the most recent data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The interactive dashboard enables parents to narrow immunization
data searches by county, and specific school.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Orange County has the highest compliance rate in central North Carolina at 97%. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Durham County has the lowest compliance rate in central North Carolina at 88%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wake County and Johnston County are listed at 94%, with Chatham County at 95%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Herd immunity, the point where enough people in a population
have achieved immunity against a virus from vaccination or prior exposure to make
it difficult for a disease to spread, varies based on the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19"&gt;World
Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; states measles requires a herd immunity of 95% to reduce
the likelihood of an outbreak. NIH studies show &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10458369/"&gt;rubella requires a
lower percentage&lt;/a&gt; of about 80-85%. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tony Moody, a pediatric infectious disease specialist who
sees patients with Duke Health, said Durham County’s low numbers are
surprising. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Durham County is lower than I would’ve expected, given it’s
a very medically savvy community,” stated Moody. “It’s a little shocking to see
kindergarten readiness is lower than you would’ve expect, and teenagers are not
as well-vaccinated as you would expect.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The doctor explained there are several factors behind why vaccinations
are lagging, including pandemic-related disruptions, and the age of the child
in question. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We obviously took a hit with the pandemic, and it was a
reasonable hit,” said Moody. “I’m not shocked we had that dip, but we have not
recovered to the extent that I would’ve hoped.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He further noted older children have historically been more
likely to miss a scheduled vaccination or fail to complete a vaccination series
on time. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“As you get into the older age ranges, and really we’re
talking about vaccines given between 9-15 years of age, they’re lower than they
are for younger children,” said Moody. “A lot of times, they’ll catch up or get
some of those vaccines as they’re heading off into college or go off into the
military.”

&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;h2&gt;What vaccines are the most urgent to schedule my child
for?&lt;/h2&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Topping the list of the most urgent vaccinations North
Carolina children need to be up to date on is MMR for measles, Moody advised. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We see that &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/triangle-hospitals-alert-measles-case-nc-june-2025/"&gt;measles is out there&lt;/a&gt;. We obviously have the
huge out breaks in Texas, we’ve had pockets across the country, there’s a huge
outbreak going on in Canada right now – and we’re just a plane ride away from everywhere,”
warned Moody. “It is so contagious it could just rip through a school before
you’ve had any opportunity to contain it.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;One dose of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html"&gt;the MMR vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is
93% effective against measles, 72% effective against mumps and 97% effective
against rubella, according to the CDC. Completing the two-dose series bumps protection
for measles up to 97% and 86% for mumps.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Moody says parents should also prioritize these vaccinations,
among others recommended by the CDC, in their child’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/by-age/index.html"&gt;first few years of life&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Haemophilus influenzae (Hib)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Moody also recommended starting the four-dose series of the pneumococcal
(PCV) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In teens and preteens, the pediatrician advises vaccinations
for meningococcal and human papillomavirus (HPV). &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;h2&gt;

Does my child need a COVID or flu vaccine right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;When it comes to a recommendation for an annual flu and
COVID shot, Moody said he strongly believes they are effective in reducing
serious illness. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;However, the pediatrician argued that being up to date on
MMR should be a higher priority for families at the current moment. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“If the decision is going to be to get the MMR and get good
immunity to that, and something else, I’m going to get the MMR. That’s the
thing that really could become a public health disaster,” he stated.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;h2&gt;
Why schedule an appointment for my child now?&lt;/h2&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Returning to the classroom can be a prime time for illnesses
to spread, especially among children who are unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Immunity can take a few weeks to build, so pediatricians
urge parents to get children up to date now, before respiratory viruses surge
in late fall and winter.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“One of the things we know is when you bring people together
who have not been together recently, they essentially swap bugs,” Moody said. “We
are all carrying around things, we are all shedding things, and we know when we
bring people together, they will start swapping things around. Any of the susceptible
individuals can potentially come down with it and get sick.”

&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;h2&gt;How do I know the recommended vaccines are safe for my
child?&lt;/h2&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Talk to your pediatrician,” Moody simply replied when asked
the same question by WRAL.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The physician offered his own services, &lt;a href="https://www.dukehealth.org/treatments/infectious-diseases"&gt;encouraging
people to call him with their questions&lt;/a&gt; or contact other reputable infectious
disease experts working locally within local health systems. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The doctor also warned of misinformation online and advised
parents to take their questions directly to their licensed family doctor. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;When asked how he navigates conversations about
misinformation with parents, Moody stated, “I think it’s tough. We have to get
better at saying, ‘Here’s what the truth is and here’s what the data show.'”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He continued, “Nobody is making these decisions because they
think they’re making the wrong decision. Part of what I would try to do is talk to them
about actual risks and actual benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Using MMR as an example, Moody shared he would explain to
parents and patients, “If you’re susceptible to measles and you get it, there’s
about a 20% chance of going into the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He continued, “When you’re talking about the vaccine, there
are people who can have reactions to it, and a very small number of people who
can have a fever.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Severe complications from the MMR vaccine are “exceedingly
rare,” the physician stated. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines don’t make money, that’s just the truth,” Moody
noted. “We’re doing it because we don’t want to see these kids going to the
hospital. We don’t want to see these kids with the long-term complications that
we know can come up from measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Moody also added he encourages those with vaccination concerns
based on religious beliefs to get involved in local scientific research efforts to find
new ways to protect against infectious diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“These things are done the way they are done because that’s
how we did them in the past, but it doesn’t mean we can’t do them a different way,”
said Moody. “Help me find a better way to do it. That’s what we want as scientists
is to find better ways of doing things.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Moody shared the &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/immunizations/vaccination-recommendations-by-the-aap/?srsltid=AfmBOoruybEhJU8xPZI4Yn3p6NsOr5sdGW4sKOnUgLJmcJjAUXLWry6T"&gt;American
Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pids.org/"&gt;Pediatric Infectious
Disease Society&lt;/a&gt; are good sources for trusted catch-up vaccine information
and data for interested parents.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

            

&lt;p&gt;Mosquito season is in full swing in Europe, and with it, mosquito-borne virus season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 470 cases of West Nile virus, chikungunya, and dengue have been reported so far this year, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/communicable-disease-threats-report-week-33-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(ECDC)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks cases in the European Union and a few other countries in the region.&lt;/p&gt;        

&lt;p&gt;These viral diseases, which usually occur when an infected mosquito bites someone, are becoming more common in Europe due to increased travel and warmer summer temperatures driven by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you need to know about these illnesses and where cases have been detected so far this summer, as of mid-August.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;West Nile virus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/west-nile-fever/surveillance-and-disease-data/disease-data-ecdc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eight European countries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have reported West Nile virus infections this year: Italy (274), Greece (35), Serbia (nine), Romania (six), France (four), Hungary (two), Spain (one) and Bulgaria (one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those counts include both probable and confirmed cases in people. &lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;Most cases so far this year have been among men aged 65 and older, and most people have been hospitalised. At least &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/08/02/ten-deaths-reported-from-west-nile-virus-in-italy-since-the-start-of-the-year"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 people in Italy have died&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from West Nile virus in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 1 in 150 people who are infected with the virus will develop severe illness, such as encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, which is inflammation of the protective membranes around the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These complications can be fatal, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chikungunya&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France has reported 111 chikungunya cases this summer, amid an uptick in cases in recent weeks. There have been 22 clusters of chikungunya infections this summer, and 16 are still active.&lt;/p&gt;  



&lt;p&gt;Italy, meanwhile, has recorded seven cases of chikungunya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya is not endemic in the EU mainland, but warmer weather during the summer months make it easier for mosquitoes to spread the virus. Most cases are typically reported in July or August, the ECDC said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two chikungunya vaccines approved in the EU, but there are no specific treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya can cause fever, nausea, headache, fatigue, rash, muscle aches, joint swelling, and joint pain, which can be debilitating and long-lasting. Severe symptoms and death are rare consequences, though babies and older adults are at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dengue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France has seen 11 dengue cases this year, while Italy has seen four and Portugal has reported two cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU health authorities believe the Portuguese infections, which were reported in Madeira in January, were likely contracted last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECDC said one type of mosquito that spreads dengue has been “established in a large part of Europe” and that another is fairly common around Madeira, Cyprus, and the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Globally, there are 100 million to 400 million dengue infections per year, according to the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who are infected with dengue have no or mild symptoms, but the virus can cause fever, headache, body aches, nausea, and a rash. In extreme cases, dengue can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no specific medication to treat dengue, and the best way to avoid infection is to take steps to prevent mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

But not everyone wants to wear prescription glasses or contact lenses. Accordingly, hundreds of thousands of people undergo corrective eye surgery each year, including LASIK -- a laser-assisted surgery that reshapes the cornea and corrects vision. The procedure can result in negative side effects, prompting researchers to take the laser out of LASIK by remodeling the cornea, rather than cutting it, in initial animal tissue tests.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Hill, a professor of chemistry at Occidental College, will present his team's results at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Fall 2025 is being held Aug. 17-21; it features about 9,000 presentations on a range of science topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human corneas are dome-shaped, clear structures that sit at the front of the eye, bending light from surroundings and focusing it onto the retina, where it's sent to the brain and interpreted as an image. But if the cornea is misshapen, it doesn't focus light properly, resulting in a blurry image. With LASIK, specialized lasers reshape the cornea by removing precise sections of the tissue. This common procedure is considered safe, but it has some limitations and risks, and cutting the cornea compromises the structural integrity of the eye. Hill explains that "LASIK is just a fancy way of doing traditional surgery. It's still carving tissue -- it's just carving with a laser."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if the cornea could be reshaped without the need for any incisions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Hill and collaborator Brian Wong are exploring through a process known as electromechanical reshaping (EMR). "The whole effect was discovered by accident," explains Wong, a professor and surgeon at the University of California, Irvine. "I was looking at living tissues as moldable materials and discovered this whole process of chemical modification."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the body, the shapes of many collagen-containing tissues, including corneas, are held in place by attractions of oppositely charged components. These tissues contain a lot of water, so applying an electric potential to them lowers the tissue's pH, making it more acidic. By altering the pH, the rigid attractions within the tissue are loosened and make the shape malleable. When the original pH is restored, the tissue is locked into the new shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, the researchers used EMR to reshape cartilage-rich rabbit ears, as well as alter scars and skin in pigs. But one collagen-rich tissue that they were eager to explore was the cornea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, the team constructed specialized, platinum "contact lenses" that provided a template for the corrected shape of the cornea, then placed each over a rabbit eyeball in a saline solution meant to mimic natural tears. The platinum lens acted as an electrode to generate a precise pH change when the researchers applied a small electric potential to the lens. After about a minute, the cornea's curvature conformed to the shape of the lens -- about the same amount of time LASIK takes, but with fewer steps, less expensive equipment and no incisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They repeated this setup on 12 separate rabbit eyeballs, 10 of which were treated as if they had myopia, or nearsightedness. In all the "myopic" eyeballs, the treatment dialed in the targeted focusing power of the eye, which would correspond to improved vision. The cells in the eyeball survived the treatment, because the researchers carefully controlled the pH gradient. Additionally, in other experiments, the team demonstrated that their technique might be able to reverse some chemical-caused cloudiness to the cornea -- a condition that is currently only treatable through a complete corneal transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this initial work is promising, the researchers emphasize that it is in its very early stages. Next up is what Wong describes as, "the long march through animal studies that are detailed and precise," including tests on a living rabbit rather than just its eyeball. They also plan to determine the types of vision correction possible with EMR, such as near- and far-sightedness and astigmatism. Though the next steps are planned, uncertainties in the team's scientific funding have put them on hold. "There's a long road between what we've done and the clinic. But, if we get there, this technique is widely applicable, vastly cheaper and potentially even reversible," concludes Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt; Electrochemical corneal refraction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt; The cornea is a transparent, highly organized anatomical structure that is responsible for ~2/3 of the refractive power of the eye. The corneal stroma consists of orthogonally stacked collagen- fibril lamellae whose molecular composition and precise macromolecular geometry eliminate backscattered light and maintain the shape of the cornea. Anatomical variation, birth defects, trauma, and various pathologies can alter the shape, structural stability, and transparency of the cornea, thus affecting vision. Surgical interventions to treat myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism include laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). Despite their popularity, these procedures are expensive and permanently lower the biomechanical strength of the cornea. Here we report our efforts to apply electromechanical reshaping (EMR) as a molecular- based, non-ablative/non-incisional alternative to laser vision refraction, using ex vivo rabbit globes. EMR relies on short electrochemical pulses to electrolyze interstitial water, with subsequent diffusion of protons into the extracellular matrix of collagenous tissues; protonation of immobilized anions within this matrix disrupts the ionic-bonding network that provides structural integrity. This leaves the tissue transiently responsive to mechanical remodeling; subsequent re-equilibration to physiological pH restores the ionic matrix, resulting in persistent shape change of the tissue. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), second-harmonic generation (SHG), and confocal microscopy suggest that EMR enables control over corneal contouring while maintaining the underlying macromolecular collagen structure and stromal cellular viability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This research was funded by the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health and the John Stauffer Charitable Trust.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In larger hospitals, the numbers are even higher. The disease comes in waves—better months and worse months—but it never disappears.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3bmde" data-offset-key="f8dd8-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="f8dd8-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="f8dd8-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;One of Brosh’s biggest concerns is Israel’s vaccination rate, which he called alarmingly low. “In Scandinavia, 70% of adults were vaccinated in the past year; in the U.S., over 40%. In Israel—less than 1%,” he said. “We went from leading the world to ranking among the worst in the developed world.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3bmde" data-offset-key="dpfb4-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="dpfb4-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dpfb4-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The drop stems from multiple factors: vaccine fatigue, public mistrust following the aggressive 2021 campaign, the psychological desire to move past COVID, and public focus on the ongoing war. Adding to the challenge, vaccine supplies have become tighter, making it difficult to book appointments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3bmde" data-offset-key="cg5q6-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cg5q6-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cg5q6-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Brosh’s recommendation is clear: “For adults over 65 and people with underlying health conditions, annual vaccination is essential. A frail elderly patient has much to gain from a COVID shot, just like with flu vaccines.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3bmde" data-offset-key="e2ikm-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="e2ikm-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="e2ikm-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Data support the warning. In the past year, 1,800 adults were hospitalized with COVID, 74 required intensive care, and 276 died within 30 days. “These are usually patients already vulnerable, whose condition deteriorates because of the virus. It’s tragic that we let this continue without acting,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3bmde" data-offset-key="2s6jj-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="2s6jj-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2s6jj-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;For younger, healthy individuals, there is no firm recommendation, though Brosh noted vaccination can reduce the risk of infection. “Most young people experience mild illness, sometimes without even realizing it. But vaccination is still possible and safe.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3bmde" data-offset-key="4g888-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4g888-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4g888-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Alongside vaccines, effective treatments exist. Paxlovid, an antiviral medication, can significantly alter the course of the disease, especially in high-risk patients.

delved into the “Make America healthy again” (Maha) movement, a “big tent” group that’s “not just Republicans”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many within the loose Maha movement are parents interested in feeding their children healthy food. “People have found themselves in Maha for all sorts of reasons, and there are areas where it has legitimate concerns,” Oliver said on Sunday evening. He pointed to numerous former episodes that overlapped with Maha concerns, from plastic to sugar to biases in medicine, and confirmed that experts agree with health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr’s central claim that American children are getting sicker; a child in the US is 15% to 20% more likely to have a chronic condition in 2023 than in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","tags":[{"id":"tv-and-radio/series/john-oliver-recap","type":"Series","title":"John Oliver recap"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/john-oliver","type":"Keyword","title":"John Oliver"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","type":"Keyword","title":"Television &amp;amp; radio"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/comedy","type":"Keyword","title":"TV comedy"},{"id":"culture/television","type":"Keyword","title":"Television"},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"Keyword","title":"Culture"},{"id":"culture/comedy","type":"Keyword","title":"Comedy"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-arts-and-culture","type":"Tracking","title":"US Arts and Culture"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"tv-and-radio/2025/aug/18/john-oliver-make-america-healthy-again","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="61460da0-d3a7-4885-8038-bc605d2f390a" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.VideoYoutubeBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“So for some, especially experts in diet and nutrition, suddenly seeing the Maha movement bring attention to issues they’re passionate about has been validating if also bittersweet,” said Oliver before a clip of renowned nutritionist Dr Marion Nestle admit that seeing Kennedy appointed health and human services secretary was “the first time I’ve heard anybody at that level of government talk about these things … I can’t get over it. And it’s hard to put that together with some of the other things he’s saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; bizarre to have someone you virulently disagree with in most respects echo your opinions in another,” Oliver confirmed. “It would be like if Kim Jong-un came out and said, ‘Wirecutter has too many articles now, and if you’re looking at Wirecutter for like ketchup, you need to reassess how you make decisions.’ It would be weird.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4a879e14-35a1-409a-8ffc-1868fcdb1511" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"John Oliver on Ice’s crackdown: ‘Trying to drive up arrests at all costs’","elementId":"4a879e14-35a1-409a-8ffc-1868fcdb1511","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/aug/11/john-oliver-trump-ice-immigration"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":3}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Unfortunately, some of ‘the other things’ RFK is saying could now have massive consequences given the position that he’s in,” he continued. “Because even when he and his movement can be right about identifying a problem, their solutions can range from the superficial to the outright dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Oliver punctured some of the movement’s claimed victories, such as the banning of certain artificial food dyes. Given that there is literature to support that synthetic food dyes can impact neurobehavior in some children, and the fact that there is no real need for them, Oliver didn’t oppose removing dyes from foods. But experts say such moves “won’t actually move the needle” when it comes to Americans’ health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Making a big deal out of narrow wins is part and parcel of this movement,” he explained, pointing to the influencer and Kennedy acolyte Vani Hari, also known as the Food Babe, who markets her own line of protein shakes in videos calling out obscure ingredients in normal milkshakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You might be thinking, well, who cares if some of Maha’s boosters can be wobbly on the science or are hawking products, as long as RFK Jr is putting reliable people in charge at the top,” said Oliver. “But I’d argue he isn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The host then looked at the brother and sister duo of Calley and Casey Means, top advisers for RFK Jr. The former claimed on the Joe Rogan podcast that he convinced Kennedy to join Trump’s campaign after a revelatory meeting at a sweat tent. “I would rather be anywhere on earth than in a sweat tent with RFK,” Oliver joked. “I’d rather be in a dumpster full of glass and cockroaches. I’d rather be in a flight where half the passengers are babies and half are Mel Gibsons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Oliver also mocked a Casey Means podcast appearance in which she drank a “liver smoothie” and winced. “I think we as a society have collectively lost our grasp of what smoothies are supposed to be,” he said. “Because there should not be meat in there, as that is definitionally no longer a smoothie. It’s hospital food for a terminally ill hyena.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Both Meanses promote the idea of “metabolic health” or, to quote their book, “Good Energy”, to the point that Calley Means said that cancer, dementia, and genetic diseases are not random, but “all tied essentially to food”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I don’t think it’s quite that simple,” said Oliver. “Most medical experts will tell you that it’s not that health outcomes can’t be impacted by personal behaviors or diet, but health is complex, and its components are personal, environmental and systemic, on top of which sometimes – and this is a technical term – shit just happens, and it’s out of your control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While the Meanses come down hard on processed foods, there are other areas where they are “worryingly lax”, said Oliver. Casey doesn’t favor restrictions on selling raw milk, which can contain carry dangerous pathogens such as salmonella, E coli and listeria, and has entertained bogus ideas on vaccines causing autism. Calley Means said on Rogan’s podcast that “if you were metabolically healthy, you did not die of Covid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If one is to take the Meanses at their word, they just want Americans to eat healthier, but their work with Kennedy is not accomplishing that goal. The new administration has cut $1bn in federal funding for schools and food banks to buy food from local suppliers, and its made cuts to Snap food assistance eligibility, meaning there are fewer recipients of free breakfast and lunch at school. “Which I guess is one way to accomplish Maha’s goals – kids can’t eat any food dyes if they’re not eating anything,” said Oliver. “And that is the thing: whatever cosmetic gain Maha has won since Trump took office have been more than offset in massive losses elsewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ae6f3979-bbcd-4676-99c0-a25004738a01" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":16,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"John Oliver: ‘Gaza is being starved by Israel’","elementId":"ae6f3979-bbcd-4676-99c0-a25004738a01","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/aug/04/john-oliver-gaza-starvation"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":3}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Oliver also looked ahead to potentially even worse losses ahead. The Department of Health and Human Services under Kennedy has already begun scaling back and defunding mRNA vaccine research, in what one public health expert called “the most dangerous public health decision I have ever seen made by a government body”. And in June, Kennedy fired everyone from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which decides on immunization standards. He has since appointed seven new members, only one of whom is recognized as a vaccine expert, the rest being, as Oliver put it, “a real who’s-uh-oh of crackpots”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is a bleak time to be involved in public health,” he summarized, as the administration is “taking a buzzsaw to so many of Maha’s stated priorities”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is maddening that for the first time in recent memory, there’s been a genuine groundswell of support for a cleaner, healthier, less corporately controlled America, but it’s taken this fucking form,” he added. “Because for the final time: it is absolutely legitimate to want Americans to be healthier, and there are clearly legitimate problems when it comes to America’s health. But these just aren’t the solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, the administration is “shredding the social safety net”, said Oliver, while “elevating voices that push the responsibility for healthcare down to the individual”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In its current form, Maha is not about making America healthy again,” he concluded. “At best, it is about laundering the reputation of an administration that is doing the exact opposite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQb3J2V0lqX2xVMUlBdWgyWFB1eWNyTzQ2UVF5aU43VTNKTW1rNW9CYmNmazktUUVnZlJKT0x4WUczQkM5TjNnaVNERTRvR09QekpqdGRGV1pYSUdMNXJfSTA4cFJvN3hFWmJhSlktT1ZCdXhWNkROd1RaaDVXRDR5cW05c3g0Q3R1NS1hWWZZQ01iYkJhcXc</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，减少一种食物类型可以使体重减轻近一倍- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE1tLXh0QjIxNkpBS3lqQ0daMUxWQXN4WjNVek1BVnBoUm5xQ0xrdkVmVmtEdXJZVkhYWXhBN25WNU9GZXRqaGhBV3MwY296MDdrZTl3c2YzcWtRMFQzWVRGVHh0a25vb25GR0s0QU04QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that cutting out a single category of foods could nearly double people's &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight-loss results.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weight-loss results.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal Nature Medicine on Aug. 4, found that overweight adults who ditched &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ultra-processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; (UPFs) lost nearly twice as much weight over a two-month span as those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPFs include microwave meals, sodas, potato chips and packaged cookies, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/5-everyday-foods-drinks-damaging-long-term-health-nutrition-experts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:5 Everyday Foods And Drinks Silently Damaging Your Long-term Health, Say Nutrition Experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Everyday Foods And Drinks Silently Damaging Your Long-term Health, Say Nutrition Experts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they can also include items marketed as &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"health foods,";elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;"health foods,"&lt;/a&gt; some medical professionals say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPFs go through multiple processes to be "stabilized for consumption," Dr. Jeffrey Kraft, a bariatric surgeon at Hackensack Meridian Palisades Medical Center in New Jersey, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A new study found that cutting out ultra-processed foods from the diet may accelerate weight loss.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Processed foods are not natural foods," he said.

In fact, 37% of Americans say they can tell how their day will go within the first 10 minutes of waking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what else we uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;1 in 3 Americans have morning thrown off by change in routine. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;It doesn’t take much to throw off a morning. Whether it’s &lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/blog/perk-up-without-caffeine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:forgetting to brew coffee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;forgetting to brew coffee&lt;/a&gt;, skipping a shower, or neglecting to drink water, these seemingly minor slip-ups can have a major impact. Here’s what people said were the biggest morning disruptors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Reasons why mornings get thrown off. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why does skipping part of your morning routine affect your whole day? Because routines provide structure, predictability and control, all of which help you mentally and physically prepare for the day ahead. When that structure is disrupted, on the other hand, your brain registers it as a break in rhythm, which can lead to feeling rushed and scattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Reasons why mornings get thrown off. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why does skipping part of your morning routine affect your whole day? Because routines provide structure, predictability, and control, all of which help you mentally and physically prepare for the day ahead. When that structure is disrupted, on the other hand, your brain registers it as a break in rhythm, which can lead to feeling rushed and scattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;So What Happens When You Wake Up on the Wrong Side of the Bed?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer? A bad day. Half of Americans say they can tell how their entire day will go based on how they feel right after waking up. Younger generations are especially attuned to this connection, with 67% of Gen Z and 58% of millennials linking a rough morning to a rough day ahead. The takeaway? How you start your day matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Generational perception of how mornings affect days. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most people don’t just feel the impact of a bad morning, they recognize it. In fact, over 60% said they could likely trace a rough day back to how it started. When you know, you know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Percentages of respondents that can identify a bad day was caused by a bad morning. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;But why does a bad morning lead to a bad day? One possible explanation is that the first hour of your day shapes your mindset, stress levels, and energy. Thus, when you wake up feeling tired, rushed, or out of sync, it can trigger a cascade of negative emotions and decision fatigue that together make it harder to stay focused, patient, or productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can You Turn a Rough Morning Around?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the morning goes sideways, most people have a go-to fix. For some, it’s a solid breakfast. For others, it’s as simple as stepping outside for fresh air or sipping more water alongside that first cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the data, these are the top things people do to turn a rough morning around:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Eating breakfast early in the day (49%)&lt;br&gt;• Getting fresh air (46%)&lt;br&gt;• Drinking as much water as coffee or tea (42%)&lt;br&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/blog/meditation-cushions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stretching;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stretching&lt;/a&gt; (35%)&lt;br&gt;• Taking a lukewarm or cool shower (27%)&lt;br&gt;• Exercising before going to work (24%)&lt;br&gt;• Spending less than 10 minutes scrolling on a phone (21%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Top seven things to do in the morning to boost your day. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regardless of gender, the top three ways to improve a morning were the same:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Eating an early breakfast&lt;br&gt;2. Getting fresh air&lt;br&gt;3. Drinking just as much water as coffee or tea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These simple habits stood out across the board as the most effective ways to reset and reclaim the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Responses to question - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;While it's helpful to know how to bounce back from a rough start, the best mornings are the ones that don’t need fixing. That’s where routine comes in. On average, it takes about 25 minutes to feel fully awake. Millennials take the longest, with a 29-minute gap between waking up and feeling awake, while the Silent Generation needs only 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Time spent waking up in minutes, by generation. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s no surprise, then, that most people build a morning routine that lasts around 30 minutes — just enough time to fully wake up and move through the habits that help them feel ready for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to our findings, these are the most common ways people start their mornings on the right foot:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Brushing their teeth (65%)&lt;br&gt;• Drinking water (60%)&lt;br&gt;• Making fresh coffee and tea (51%)&lt;br&gt;• Clearing their eyes (48%)&lt;br&gt;• Scrolling through missed notifications (40%)&lt;br&gt;• Stretching (38%)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Graph showing tasks that comprise a typical morning routine. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;But What If a Great Morning Starts the Night Before?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as people focus on what happens after the alarm goes off, the truth is, better mornings often begin long before that. In fact, most (68%) agree that a good night of sleep is the real secret to a good day — and the data backs it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Cycle showing the relationship between a good night of sleep and having a good day. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sleep well, wake well, live better. It’s a cycle worth getting right. Most adults (75%) believe their day would be better if they got the perfect amount of sleep. This is especially true for Gen Zers, with 80% of respondents born between the years 1997 and 2012 believing that getting the perfect amount of sleep leads to a better day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Percentage of people who believe their day would be better with better sleep, by generation. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;We all know what the perfect night of sleep feels like, but how many of us are actually getting it? When we asked people to compare how much sleep they typically get versus how much they wish they got, the gap was impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority report sleeping between four and six hours a night, even though 80% say their ideal would be seven to nine hours. And while 72% believe hitting that sweet spot would make their day better, only 47% are actually doing it. The struggle for better sleep? Very real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Opinions on getting the perfect amount of sleep. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;How to Give Yourself the Best Chance at Rest&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like the path to better mornings starts the night before, the path to better sleep starts before your head hits the pillow. Many people rely on small, familiar habits to help them &lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/blog/healthy-bedtime-routine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wind down;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;wind down&lt;/a&gt; — watching TV, reading, pouring a glass of water, or &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/bed-pro-step-step-guide-150005165.html" data-ylk="slk:putting fresh bedding on the bed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;putting fresh bedding on the bed&lt;/a&gt;.

Better Days Begin With Better Sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the first few minutes after waking up to the small habits we rely on before bed, one theme is clear: how we structure our routines matters. A consistent morning sets the tone for the day, but real energy, focus, and resilience start the night before — with enough rest, the right habits, and a space (&lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/adult/mattresses" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mattress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mattress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/np/adult-bedding" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bedding;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;bedding&lt;/a&gt; included) that supports deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because when you sleep better, you live better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;TL;DR: Quick Answers to Your Morning Routine Questions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long does it take to feel fully awake in the morning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;On average, it takes about 25 minutes to fully wake up in the morning (though it varies slightly by generation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long should a morning routine be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A morning routine should be about 30 minutes long. That’s the average across all age groups and matches the time most people need to fully wake up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can I do to improve a bad morning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eating breakfast early, getting fresh air, and drinking water are the top three things people do to improve a bad morning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can a bad morning really ruin your day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes. 49% of people say their morning plays a major role in how the rest of the day goes, and 37% can tell within 10 minutes how their day will unfold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does better sleep lead to a better day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Absolutely. 70% of people believe that a good night of sleep improves their day, and 68% of people believe a good day improves their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What helps people fall asleep and stay asleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Top bedtime habits for better sleep include watching TV, reading, drinking a glass of water, using fresh sheets, and limiting screen time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/healthy-morning-habits" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This story;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; was produced by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://naturepedic.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Naturepedic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Naturepedic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and reviewed and distributed by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://hubs.la/Q03klgSR0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stacker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stacker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:07:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9BMW81OFliQjM3UW5ZRFJIY0psRTVPQnRtbnpXU01QbTlfVWNfMDNPQ1l4ZHJmZDZUWkM0M2lNaTZoOTdEMHhWSlhsZ2tES01ORzBpVEdEdkRpcmFHZllPQmZ5eWNsb3g4N1E</guid></item><item><title>“我的癌症症状被误认为是更年期的迹象–现在我无法行走” -《独立报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOVTlJZ01ZTHJTaGJGQXRXZ1h0cmp5UTQxTzlOMjl0aE5iVnlMLWFZSUFwbTVjRW5TTlFhNmlhaWh0RlhHZFRSekx6QXpzam4xYmRoZUppaWxCcTRHRk9sLURZUFRqd1R2LTBNMmJKSVBhcHl1NXhRVjBjSEhzd1dWR1d6NjY3TVFUaUo0dzY3VExwVGZ0TFNPNEhySQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

However, she was told the back pain was due to gardening,&lt;/a&gt; despite having only done 20 minutes of this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next two months, her symptoms worsened and she stopped eating properly, lost weight, and developed a temperature, later losing all sensation in her legs and as well as bladder and bowel function. After being taken to the hospital and admitted for two weeks, she was given the devastating&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;news that she had stage four non-Hodgkin lymphoma in her kidneys, and a tumour wrapped around her spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one round of radiotherapy and further chemotherapy, she is now in remission. However, she has been left unable to walk and is now a full-time wheelchair user. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “life-changing” impacts of the cancer have meant she has to reduce her working hours to four a week, while her husband has given up work to be a full-time carer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-right"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dZfcjv"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/50/1092bef4-6281-4a84-be95-1403ffe828e0.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/50/1092bef4-6281-4a84-be95-1403ffe828e0.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/50/1092bef4-6281-4a84-be95-1403ffe828e0.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Karen Davey, 54, is now in remission after being treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-14146"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Karen Davey, 54, is now in remission after being treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Spinal Injuries Association)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Davey told the Spinal Injuries Association she felt her symptoms were “dismissed” by her GP and continued to be dismissed until she was admitted to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said: “I’d gone from somebody who was quite active before. I’d do a lot of hiking across the moors, I used to go cold water swimming all year round. One of the last things I did before I got ill was an abseil off a 120-foot viaduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t what I’m supposed to be doing at this time of life. I’ve not yet been able to get back to driving or anything like that. I’m completely reliant on my husband; it’s messed up my social life, just going out to meet friends or going swimming or popping into town to look around the shops. Emotionally, it’s just completely messed me up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Davey said she wanted to spread awareness of her situation and help others who might be experiencing similar symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-left"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 PzkRY"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/54/872d2dae-0e52-4636-aaff-8c656ef837e7.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/54/872d2dae-0e52-4636-aaff-8c656ef837e7.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/54/872d2dae-0e52-4636-aaff-8c656ef837e7.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Karen Davey, 54, was told by her GP her cancer symptoms were menopause" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-14147"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Karen Davey, 54, was told by her GP her cancer symptoms were menopause&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Spinal Injuries Association)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said, “I had no idea that hot flushes would lead to all this. The symptoms you’ve got aren’t always menopause symptoms, and we need to be more mindful of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just get annoyed that it was attributed to menopause and doing gardening when it needed looking into a bit more. I didn’t know anything about &lt;a href="/topic/spinal-cord-injury"&gt;spinal cord injury&lt;/a&gt; and when my toes started going tingly, it didn’t occur to me that that’s what it was. There’s not enough information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinal Injuries Association supports people living with spinal cord injuries. Dharshana Sridhar, campaigns manager at Spinal Injuries Association, said, “Karen’s story is a powerful reminder that women’s health symptoms should never be dismissed or explained away without proper investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Too often, women with spinal cord injuries face delays in diagnosis and unnecessary barriers to equitable care, leaving them to cope with life-changing consequences that could have been prevented. Across the board, women’s concerns are frequently overlooked and when disability or other intersecting factors are involved, the barriers to timely diagnosis and treatment become even greater. Through our women’s health campaign, we’re calling for better awareness, earlier diagnosis, and accessible healthcare for every woman, no matter her disability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOVTlJZ01ZTHJTaGJGQXRXZ1h0cmp5UTQxTzlOMjl0aE5iVnlMLWFZSUFwbTVjRW5TTlFhNmlhaWh0RlhHZFRSekx6QXpzam4xYmRoZUppaWxCcTRHRk9sLURZUFRqd1R2LTBNMmJKSVBhcHl1NXhRVjBjSEhzd1dWR1d6NjY3TVFUaUo0dzY3VExwVGZ0TFNPNEhySQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
