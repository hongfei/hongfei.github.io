But a good one, a real one, can hold its own next to a burger or even a steak. The problem is, most of what ends up in grocery carts isn’t that. With summer cookouts around the corner, we looked at some of the most popular grocery brands and checked &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/what_is_a_hotdog_brand_you_dont_like/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:which ones get the most hate from shoppers on Reddit.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;which ones get the most hate from shoppers on Reddit.com&lt;/a&gt; — and why. Here are the six worst grocery store hot dogs, according to shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gwaltney Great Dogs Original&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwaltney claims these are &lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Gwaltney-Original-Chicken-Hot-Dogs-Bun-Size-3-lb/10452733" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“America’s No. 1 chicken hot dog,”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;“America’s No. 1 chicken hot dog,”&lt;/a&gt; and their main selling point is that they have 40% less fat than regular beef hot dogs. They’re marketed as a lighter, affordable option, and you’ll usually find them at places like Walmart, Food Lion, and other big grocery chains for about $1.50 to $2 a pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you’re actually getting is a hot dog made mostly of mechanically separated chicken, with some pork, water, corn syrup, and generic “flavorings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re not big in the flavor department either — and judging by Reddit, people have some strong feelings about that. “They are absolutely horrific and the way they look in the frying pan is disturbing me to my core,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/1fujwa2/comment/lpzzhrr/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said one Redditor.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;said one Redditor.&lt;/a&gt;“They’re the second worst hot dog I’ve ever had the displeasure of biting into and then promptly spitting into a napkin and throwing away,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/1fujwa2/comment/lpzx4t8/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:adds another.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;adds another.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;FUD Hot Dogs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll mostly find them at Walmart and select grocery stores, especially in areas with a large Hispanic customer base. They’re priced in the low-to-mid range, usually around $2.50 to $3 a pack, but you’re mostly paying for disappointment. These are made from mechanically separated chicken and pork, with salt, flavoring, and sodium lactate to round out the flavorless parade. Reddit users have roasted FUD consistently for years — many say they couldn’t even finish the pack. The texture is rubbery, the taste is bland and off-putting, and even boiling doesn’t help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bar-S Classic and Beef Franks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bar-S is an ultra-budget brand owned by Sigma (yes, same as FUD), and it’s one of the top-selling hot dog brands in America, not because it’s good, but because it’s dirt cheap. You can find it everywhere from Walmart to Dollar General, usually under $1.50 per pack. It’s also one of the most hated hot dog brands out there. The classic franks are made with mechanically separated chicken and turkey, with a little pork thrown in and beef hearts for flair. Ingredients include corn syrup, sodium nitrite, and potassium lactate. On Reddit and Chowhound, they’re called “possessed,” “mushy,” “too sweet,” and “unsettling in texture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bar s dogs of all flavors are like eating marshmallow meat and they don’t get plump when you cook them”&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/comment/kg2waog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one Redditor said.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one Redditor said.&lt;/a&gt; “Mystery meat dogs at their worst.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oscar Mayer Classic Wieners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oscar Mayer proudly claims their hot dogs have “no fillers,” which feels a bit rich when you flip the package over and see what’s actually in them. The ingredient list starts with mechanically separated chicken and turkey, plus some pork, which translates to mystery meat and a long scroll of additives like sodium phosphate, sodium benzoate, and sodium nitrite. This isn’t exactly a clean label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find these just about everywhere — Target, Kroger, Safeway — for around $3.50 to $5 a pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They do have a nostalgic fan base, but they are also wildly roasted on Reddit for being the “default bad hot dog.” ​​I sometimes think about buying Oscar Mayers hot dogs then I see them on the shelf and I look at their color and then always pass,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/comment/kg9k6hj/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one user sums it up.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one user sums it up.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ball Park Franks (Regular and Grillmaster)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ball Park is everywhere — Costco, CVS, your neighbor’s Fourth of July cookout. Owned by Tyson Foods, the brand has been around forever and sells a dizzying number of varieties. The regular franks are made from a blend of mechanically separated chicken and pork, corn syrup, and a long list of preservatives. They’re soft, overly sweet, and don’t grill particularly well. According to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/comment/kgglubl/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one Redditor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one Redditor&lt;/a&gt;. “They taste like what you imagine hot dog water tastes like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beef versions, especially the Grillmaster line, get noticeably more respect. They’re made with actual beef — no mystery meats — and they cook up with better texture and flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Jennie-O Turkey Franks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennie-O is known for turkey, but these franks don’t do the brand any favors. They show up in most grocery stores — Safeway, Meijer, Albertsons — for around $3 to $4 a pack, and they’re sold as the “healthier” option. But low fat doesn’t mean much when the end result is dry, dense, and painfully bland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ingredients aren’t great either — mechanically separated turkey, water, corn syrup, and not much else. No real seasoning to speak of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More Hot Dog Stories From Cheapism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 06:11:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5PbnZ3OVNkT21YS3F6dml2OW1zYXFaeWZxck9aSVI4bnI3VV8tUjY1MVVWeDBTajUxcnBWMENneU9CQjFqSXhoUEoyMWhyVUZWWi1xemRJS3RNbXZaUTNhY1p5R0dZdzFoYjAtTUhmOWxsdm8</guid></item><item><title>这30分钟的步行比10,000步更有效，一位美国顶级医生解释说-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/this-30-minute-walk-is-more-effective-than-10000-steps-a-top-us-doctor-explains/photostory/124493563.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tania Elliott explained that walking for 30 minutes can provide more health benefits than walking 30,000 steps. “This 30-minute walk is more effective than getting 10,000 steps,” Dr. Tania Elliott said in a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPj5Y1hElVV/?hl=en"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; shared on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what is this specific walking in question?

This number is projected to increase by 73% by 2040, resulting in approximately 1.6 million deaths per year, according to the WHO. This type of cancer is becoming increasingly common in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;young people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, and factors including lifestyle play a crucial role. While certain foods can increase the risk of colon cancer, some others can reduce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine eating some delicious snack and protecting yourself from colon cancer. Yes, you read it right. An indulgent snack and its key ingredient are linked to reduced risk and recurrence of colon cancer. An observational study found that the chance of colon cancer recurrence was nearly cut in half in people who eat nuts and nut butter. The findings are published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5891130/#s8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Journal of Clinical Oncology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in India and it’s fully treatable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The role of nuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basic healthy eating can often be overlooked during cancer treatment. This study demonstrates that a simple dietary change, such as eating tree nuts, may have a significant impact on a patient's long-term survival. Nut consumption and a healthy diet are generally factors that clinicians and patients should perhaps pay attention to as they design the approach to treatment for colorectal cancer," ASCO President Daniel F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hayes, MD, FACP, FASCO, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The observational study examined 826 patients with stage III colon cancer. They found that nuts, especially peanuts, had a profound impact on colon cancer. In patients who consumed two ounces or more of nuts per week, they saw a 42% lower chance of cancer recurrence and a 57% lower chance of death than those who did not eat nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the benefit of nut consumption was limited to tree nuts in a secondary analysis. These include almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, cashews, and pecans, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Numerous studies in the fields of heart disease and diabetes have shown the benefits of nut consumption, and we felt that it was important to determine if these benefits could also apply to colorectal cancer patients," Temidayo Fadelu, MD, a clinical fellow in medicine at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and lead author, said. "Patients with advanced disease who benefit from chemotherapy frequently ask what else they can do to reduce their chances of recurrence or death, and our study is an important contribution to the idea that modifying diet and physical activity can be beneficial," Fadelu added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They observed no associated reduction in cancer recurrence and death among patients who consumed peanuts or peanut butter. It could be because being legumes, peanuts have a different metabolic composition than tree nuts, the authors said. Also, peanuts are by far the most widely consumed nut in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with stage III colon cancer have up to a 70% chance of surviving three years after treatment, which typically includes surgery and/or chemotherapy. Though previous studies have looked at the role of diet as a potential cancer prevention role, this is the first to examine the benefits of nuts in treating colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study, the researchers analyzed a questionnaire from a CALGB clinical trial of patients with stage III colon cancer that began in 1999. They asked about the patients’ dietary intake, including whether or not patients ate nuts and what types of nuts they consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were eager to know about nut consumption, as it is already linked to lower incidence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and a reduction in insulin resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on the associations between overall nut consumption and just tree nut consumption and the risk of cancer recurrence and death. They found that patients who consumed two or more ounces of all types of nuts per week (19% of all patients in the study) had a 42% lower chance of cancer recurrence and a 57% lower chance of death than those patients who did not eat nuts after completion of their cancer treatment. In people who reported tree nut consumption, the chance of recurrence was 46% lower and the chance of death was 53% lower in those who ate at least two ounces per week, compared to those who didn’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Trump Undergoes Mystery Health Checkup At Walter Reed Amid Growing Speculations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the experts saying?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tree nuts consumption can be crucial in both preventing and cutting the risk of recurrence of colon cancer. "It should be emphasized that the authors are not suggesting that eating nuts should be considered a substitute for standard chemotherapy and other treatments for colon cancer, which have dramatically improved survival. Rather, patients with colon cancer should be optimistic, and they should eat a healthy diet, including tree nuts, which may not only keep them healthier, but may also further decrease the chances of the cancer coming back," Dr. Hayes said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to look at the potential positive impact of nut consumption on survival at other stages of colon cancer, particularly stage IV. Ultimately, we need to understand how nuts confer this protective effect, as well as possibly conduct a randomized, controlled clinical trial where diet recommendations are given at the start of the study to prove that tree nuts can reduce recurrence and death after treatment for colon cancer," Dr. Fadelu added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 01:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8AFBVV95cUxQck1lTDdRN25kdm1MT3pNQWR3NUZsaTB3NTd0UVU2ajJJSHZPN0M4aWE0SkJFQUpUekFYbnBZYzdNaEM1Q2pEeVdLQlVKblIzd1JOcEgtNEdMNmVvY0laZVdnR3RiM0tjcGc5NkJ3eG9ROFlXZzFwb2NMOFZPV3YzLU9uSWxZMTN1UXhPS1dUWnVFMnlZSXgxQkRiTFpZXzJ0azZHUDVnMVM1M0p1emVwV2FSSG5JSUVHMl9uemxYYi1iTHVXazNkVUdtcFV5UnZuTlRRT09TbDhXSzF2OXNHOFl1cFlxRHNUaDBwOFdDQzc</guid></item><item><title>普通感冒、流感、新冠肺炎：为什么英国现在病得这么重？ - BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jz608l9l4o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 jRDKjj"&gt;Cold, flu, Covid: Why is everyone sick right now?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-c4820dd1-0 cYDsPh"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-c4820dd1-11 bxdaHR"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-c4820dd1-5 iYeVyy"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-c4820dd1-7 dbQBRo"&gt;Nick Triggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="undefined-role-location" class="sc-c4820dd1-8 evcqcz"&gt;Health correspondent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 ERpRj"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d262/live/c2050750-a6bb-11f0-a356-d3fc7522eb5a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d262/live/c2050750-a6bb-11f0-a356-d3fc7522eb5a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d262/live/c2050750-a6bb-11f0-a356-d3fc7522eb5a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d262/live/c2050750-a6bb-11f0-a356-d3fc7522eb5a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d262/live/c2050750-a6bb-11f0-a356-d3fc7522eb5a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d262/live/c2050750-a6bb-11f0-a356-d3fc7522eb5a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d262/live/c2050750-a6bb-11f0-a356-d3fc7522eb5a.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d262/live/c2050750-a6bb-11f0-a356-d3fc7522eb5a.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="iStock/Getty Images A woman with ginger hair and wearing a white T-shirt sneezing while pinching her nose, against a bright orange background" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;iStock/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Are you ill?

Immunity has waned and people are getting ill." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;There are actually more than 100 different viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections, plus some bacterial infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Is there more illness than normal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;Data collection from the UK Health Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; (UKHSA) shows Rhinovirus – what many of us would call the common cold – has been on the increase in recent weeks and seems to be the most common cause of illness at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Covid is also doing the rounds, driven by two new variants – XFG, called Stratus by some, and NB.1.8.1, known as Nimbus. But there is already a high degree of immunity built up in the population meaning, for most, it's a fairly mild infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;There are signs flu may be on the rise too – there has been an increase in the 15-25 age group over the past week - while RSV, which can cause serious illness in young children, also tends to take off in the autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"There is often, although not always, a pattern," says Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"You tend to see Rhinovirus take off first and then RSV," he explains. "Flu tends to come later in December and January. But that's not always the case – and certainly the pandemic disrupted the traditional seasonal trends. What we've seen in the last year or so is those trends return to something like normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He says the levels of illnesses at the moment are not particularly high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Covid is above baseline and there's a lot of Rhinovirus around. The uptick in flu in that younger age group has perhaps come a little bit earlier than we would expect, but it is still at a low level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Is it a cold, flu or Covid?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The most common symptoms, according to the NHS, are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;b id="colds" class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;Colds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 bYhyhr"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Symptoms appear gradually&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Mostly affect nose and throat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Early sign - pressure in your ears&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Chestier, mucus cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;b id="flu" class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;Flu&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 bYhyhr"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Comes on suddenly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Feel wiped out&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Fever, muscle aches, exhaustion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Need bed rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Dry cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;b id="covid" class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;Covid&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 bYhyhr"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Typical flu symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Loss of taste of smell&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Diarrhoea or tummy upset&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Many of the symptoms between cold, flu and more serious viruses like Covid overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;How can you protect yourself?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Respiratory infections can, of course, be really dangerous for vulnerable people - in a bad winter tens of thousands of people can die of flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But there is nothing to suggest the respiratory viruses circulating now are causing more serious illness this year in otherwise healthy people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We all react in different ways – and we don't really understand why," admits Prof Ball. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Of course, age and fitness have a lot to do with it, but sometimes it is just your individual genetics or how tired and rundown you may be, or when you were last exposed to that particular virus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In terms of protecting yourself, the most important step to take, if you are eligible, is to get vaccinatinated.

In some ways, it's a good thing when you are a child or healthy adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"By getting exposed you are building up your immunity through natural infection - so when you are older you hopefully have enough immunity to not get severely ill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 23:07:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1SMWdvdzItbTc5T2lXdml6VERIN25XUHR2YU92NGxNVExPSmg0cEVnMDFRcWYzOVFTYnFPQWwxaWFxUEFvM3VoS0FJOXhwTW5nNHV2eFZFRDZuQdIBX0FVX3lxTE1uTkUtSEVldXB3NTJ0WVR1MVJ4Vml2RW1HNDNUWDl4aXBYZ1NMN24zLTVEWXNfX1NEZzNaODNEQjlVQzFIcmhqWFotUVRMZDU4WDlqclZxaWRiWW5KQ0l3</guid></item><item><title>由哈佛大学训练有素的医生推荐的5种抗衰老补充剂-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/5-anti-aging-supplements-recommended-by-a-harvard-trained-doctor/photostory/124472716.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PectaSol is a pure citrus pectin for increased absorption.

The need for a new "out-of-the-clump" way of thinking about Alzheimer's is emerging as a top priority in brain science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My laboratory at the Krembil Brain Institute, part of the University Health Network in Toronto, is devising a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/trc2.12283"&gt;new theory of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our past 30 years of research, we no longer think of Alzheimer's as primarily a disease of the brain. Rather, we believe that Alzheimer's is principally &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1567205018666211202141650"&gt;a disorder of the immune system within the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune system, found in every organ in the body, is a collection of cells and molecules that work in harmony to help repair injuries and protect from foreign invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_launch"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Launch" class="alignnone wp-image-177073 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a person trips and falls, the immune system helps to mend the damaged tissues. When someone experiences a viral or bacterial infection, the immune system helps in the fight against these microbial invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact same processes are present in the brain. When there is head trauma, the brain's immune system kicks into gear to help repair. When bacteria are present in the brain, the immune system is there to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144645" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144645" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642.jpg" alt="Bright green cells with orange spots in between them" class="size-full wp-image-144645" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144645" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;White blood cells of the immune system, activated to fight a bacterial infection.

It is supposed to be there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When brain trauma occurs or when bacteria are present in the brain, beta-amyloid is a key contributor to the brain's comprehensive immune response. And this is where the problem begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of striking similarities between the fat molecules that make up both the membranes of bacteria and the membranes of brain cells, beta-amyloid cannot tell the difference between invading bacteria and host brain cells, and mistakenly attacks the very brain cells it is supposed to be protecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leads to a chronic, progressive loss of brain cell function, which ultimately culminates in dementia – all because our body's immune system cannot differentiate between bacteria and brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When regarded as a misdirected attack by the brain's immune system on the very organ it is supposed to be defending, Alzheimer's disease emerges as an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many types of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, in which autoantibodies play a crucial role in the development of the disease, and for which steroid-based therapies can be effective. But these therapies will not work against Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is a very special and distinctive organ, recognized as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234155/#"&gt;the most complex structure in the Universe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144646" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144646" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642.jpg" alt="A senior man and woman looking at a book together" class="size-full wp-image-144646" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144646" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alzheimer's is arguably one of the most important diseases confronting humankind.

For example, some scientists believe that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mito.2022.05.001"&gt;Alzheimer's is a disease of tiny cellular structures called mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; – the energy factories in every brain cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria convert oxygen from the air we breathe and glucose from the food we eat into the energy required for remembering and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some maintain that it is the end-result of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/1673-5374.339476"&gt;particular brain infection&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/prd.12429"&gt;bacteria from the mouth often being suggested as the culprit&lt;/a&gt;. Still others suggest that the disease may arise from an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biom12050714"&gt;abnormal handling of metals within the brain&lt;/a&gt;, possibly zinc, copper, or iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is gratifying to see &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2021-327370"&gt;new thinking about this age-old disease&lt;/a&gt;. Dementia currently affects more than 50 million people worldwide, with a new diagnosis being made every three seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, people living with Alzheimer's disease are unable to recognize their own children or even their spouse of more than 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's is a public health crisis in need of innovative ideas and fresh directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144650" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144650" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642.jpg" alt="A young person kissing an older lady on the cheek" class="size-full wp-image-144650" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144650" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Often, people living with Alzheimer's disease are unable to recognize their own children.

But the label that people often unthinkingly slap on toxic bosses or reality TV villains hides a much more complicated psychological picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have studied narcissism for many years, but over time, our understanding has evolved. One of the biggest changes is that today, narcissism is no longer seen as just grandiosity, arrogance or egotism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early scientific descriptions of narcissism &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735807001602?via%3Dihub"&gt;focused on dominance&lt;/a&gt;, ambition and self-importance, all of which are traits associated with traditional masculine stereotypes. That meant narcissistic tendencies in women were often misread or overlooked. When those traits &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0038231"&gt;show up as emotional sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, insecurity or relational manipulation, they sometimes still are misdiagnosed as anxiety, mood disorders or &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1090746/full"&gt;borderline personality disorder&lt;/a&gt; traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most extreme and persistent forms of narcissism can sometimes be diagnosed as narcissistic personality disorder. This condition was added to the &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-14907-000"&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/a&gt;, the American Psychiatric Association’s diagnostic manual, in 1980. But most people with narcissistic tendencies won’t meet the threshold for a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what does the research actually say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narcissism in general is &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09637214211044109"&gt;now understood&lt;/a&gt; as a complex set of personality characteristics that can show up in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists had long suspected that there might be different kinds of narcissism, but it wasn’t until 1991 – when researcher Paul Wink and his colleagues &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.61.4.590"&gt;presented a model&lt;/a&gt; including grandiose and vulnerable subtypes – that they were more formally recognised. Although there are other models, this remains one of the more popular approaches to understanding narcissistic tendencies in the wider population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09637214211044109"&gt;2021 review&lt;/a&gt; by US psychologist Joshua Miller and his colleagues pulled together decades of research to offer one of the most authoritative summaries of how psychologists now understand narcissism. It explains that narcissism has a common foundation, which includes things such as self-importance and entitlement. It then branches into different forms of narcissism, such as grandiosity, antagonism and vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers now often use the terms &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735807001602?via%3Dihub"&gt;grandiose and vulnerable&lt;/a&gt; to describe two major forms of narcissism. One person with narcissistic traits may be bold with high levels of grandiose traits, confidence and emotional resilience. Another might be defensive, anxious and hypersensitive to criticism. Both show signs of narcissistic self-focus, but they end up looking quite different in how they experience and express emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188692100773X?via%3Dihub"&gt;2022 research paper&lt;/a&gt; I wrote with colleagues, we carried out the first meta-analysis examining how narcissistic traits relate to the ability to control one’s emotions. The results showed that vulnerable narcissism is consistently associated with greater emotional difficulty, which means these people might find it harder to keep their emotions in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, people with high scores on vulnerable narcissism scales are more likely to rely on suppression. Suppression is a strategy that people use to hide or inhibit their emotional expressions, and has been linked to &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.85.2.348"&gt;poorer wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;. On the surface, suppression might sound like self-control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some situations, it can be. For example, keeping a lid on your emotions when your boss is yelling at you. But trying to mute emotional expression without addressing the underlying emotions increases stress when it becomes our default strategy. It can worsen mental and physical health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, grandiose narcissism wasn’t linked with emotion regulation difficulties. In fact, several of the studies included in our analysis suggest that people with higher levels of grandiose traits may not experience as much emotional distress in the first place. This challenges the popular idea among researchers that people who exhibit narcissistic tendencies are also experiencing emotional instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Emotional intelligence and self-perception&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differences between forms of narcissism show up in emotional intelligence research as well. In a &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17540739211014585"&gt;2021 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; on narcissism and emotional intelligence, my colleagues and I found that people with grandiose traits often said they were good at understanding and managing emotions. For instance, how well they think they can handle anger or recognise other’s emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when their skills were tested using emotion tasks (such as recognising facial expressions or identifying the best way to respond to an emotional situation), their performance didn’t always match up with how skilled they said they were. This is consistent with a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01606/full"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; which also found that people with grandiose tendencies rated themselves as emotionally skilled but performed worse on skill-based emotional intelligence tasks compared to other participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, people with vulnerable narcissistic traits tend to rate themselves lower in emotional intelligence, and seem to genuinely struggle more with managing emotions in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what should we make of all this?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s time to move beyond the pop-psych trend of labelling difficult people as narcissists. Narcissism isn’t about taking too many selfies. And no, the partner who ghosted you or the colleague who dominates meetings isn’t necessarily high in narcissistic traits either – no matter how much we might like to complain about them over coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These kinds of casual diagnoses aren’t just unhelpful, they’re often wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narcissism is a complex psychological pattern that can show up in different ways and can reflect a deeper struggle with things such as self-esteem, emotion regulation and social connection. Understanding this doesn’t excuse people’s bad behaviour – not at all. But it does help us look past the stereotypes to get a clearer picture of what narcissistic traits look like in everyday life.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258505/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258505/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

The Maricopa County Environmental Services Vector Control Division said they’ve been receiving more complaints in the last 10 days compared to all of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Division manager John Townsend said they’ve received almost a thousand community complaints in the last week or so, bringing them up to about 3,000 for the calendar year so far. All of 2024, Townsend said, they received around 1,000 community complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’ve been very small, and it’s been a lot at once. They bit me up. This is the most I've ever been bit by mosquitoes in my life,” said Phoenix resident Tayja.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the video player above, find out the difference between the mosquitoes you see during the day and at night and what you can do to protect yourself. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Professor Yoko Tsukamoto of the Health Sciences University of Hokkaido spoke to the Japanese media, saying, “The flu season has started really early this year, but in the changing global environment this might become a more common scenario.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tsukamoto advised common precautions like vaccination, wearing masks, washing hands regularly and avoiding spreading infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have been urging the vulnerable population including the elderly, children and those with pre-existing conditions to get vaccinated immediately. “For most healthy individuals, the flu may be unpleasant but not dangerous. But for vulnerable groups, early vaccination is crucial,” added Tsukamoto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 17:11:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>25年前，果园港的人预计会得阿尔茨海默氏症。为什么不呢？ -《西雅图时报》</title><link>https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/port-orchard-man-was-expected-to-get-alzheimers-25-years-ago-why-hasnt-he/</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxNSUdCMGdOaEVFWGdDSVppbjdOYkZjZE1KdGZ2RkZUNFVQVU5zYjNUbWh5NmlMRDNrcDkwSS0zSjhBaTdHR0pZS1hJWEV1OTdCeV9fUEpuR09vV0llbXdWaXJhcV84T3kya1ZLQVZaNEVvZXRLSGlUSVZVNmNmTFJnQ3Jjd2lHV0swV1FKOHZUOVB4ZS05Wk01S2lFTGFrd3pETzU1VFJRR3pBN291UzRKQ2Z2UTZ4YWhpYU5MdVpSQ2o?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Port Orchard man was expected to get Alzheimer’s 25 years ago.

&lt;p&gt;Of course, not scratching isn’t the only way to speed up your recovery, and there are a few &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/about/about-mosquito-bites.html" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956216" data-affiliate="true"&gt;other steps&lt;/a&gt; you want to take to prevent infection and make sure your bite gets better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very first thing you want to do after you get bit is wash the bite out with soap and water. This will help remove &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/insect-bites-and-stings/#:~:text=Easing%20your%20symptoms,do%20to%20ease%20your%20symptoms." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956216" data-affiliate="true"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; near the bite that could cause an infection. A mosquito bite is technically a small wound, said Frable, and “it’s generally a good idea to wash all wounds gently with soap and water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, you want to apply ice to the bite, ideally for about 10 minutes or so, Pritt explained. Ice can drastically reduce the itching along with inflammation, pain and swelling, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17695-mosquito-bites#:~:text=Ice:%20Ice%20can%20slow%20down,vera%20is%20a%20succulent%20plant." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956216" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up: Cover the bite with an anti-itch or antihistamine cream, such as calamine lotion or hydrocortisone. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17695-mosquito-bites" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956216" data-affiliate="true"&gt;These products&lt;/a&gt; can drastically reduce itchiness and, most importantly, prevent you from scratching the bite and break the scratch-itch cycle, Pritt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have these items in your medicine cabinet or aren’t able to get to a pharmacy, you can whip up an &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mosquito-bites/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20375314" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956216" data-affiliate="true"&gt;anti-itch paste&lt;/a&gt; at home. Simply combine a tablespoon of baking soda with a splash of water to create a thick paste. Then, rub the mixture over the bite, wait 10 minutes, and wash it off. This DIY concoction reduces itch, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mosquito-bites/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20375314" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956216" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, but, better yet, it prevents you from scratching the bite and making things even worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, you want to keep an eye on the bite and pay attention to any symptoms you develop over the next week or two. It’s fairly common to develop a fever or even swollen lymph nodes immediately after the bite, so don’t panic if you experience &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/about/about-mosquito-bites.html#:~:text=What%20happens%20when%20a%20mosquito,soreness,%20and%20redness%20can%20occur.&amp;amp;text=The%20body%20reacts%20to%20mosquito%20saliva%20following%20a%20blood%20meal." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956216" data-affiliate="true"&gt;these symptoms&lt;/a&gt; right away, Pritt said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all mosquitoes carry disease, but some spread Zika, dengue and West Nile virus, all of which can cause severe illnesses and health complications. You can’t tell if a mosquito carried a pathogen by simply looking at the bite, according to Frable, which is why it’s crucial to pay attention to any symptoms. So, if you get a fever, a rash, severe headache, or confusion a week or two after the bite, check in with a physician. They can run diagnostics tests to determine if you contracted a mosquito-borne disease and administer supportive care to help you recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, most mosquito bites resolve without any issues. But the less you itch and the better you take care of it, the sooner it’ll clear up … until the next mosquito comes along. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-to-do-mosquito-bite_l_66c4c636e4b0047d36bf6f3a" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956216"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14947279/doctors-reveal-simple-lifestyle-changes-prevent-dementia-study.html"&gt;landmark trial unveiled earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; found people at risk of developing dementia improved their cognitive scores after implementing diet changes, as well as exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, recent studies have shown foods rich in nutrients like protein, antioxidants and carbohydrates could reduce the risk the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eggs, which were &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14133867/surprising-link-eggs-dementia-risk.html"&gt;long demonized for high fat and cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, in particular are enjoying a health renaissance for containing brain-healthy amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Berries and dark, leafy greens, meanwhile are rich in antioxidants that protect brain cells responsible for memory shielded from inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And even dark chocolate may improve blood flow to the brain and boost functioning in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Daily Mail has revealed the best dementia-fighting foods below.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Studies have revealed the foods that are most likely to stave off dementia (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eggs are a key feature in the standard American diet, with more than one in three adults claiming they have them for breakfast on a given day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One large egg contains about 150 milligrams of choline, about one-quarter of the recommended daily value. Choline is an essential nutrient also found in protein sources such as salmon and beef and chicken livers that supports memory, mood and muscle control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought to boost levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which controls memory and learning, and reduce levels of neurotoxins like homocysteine that damage neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eggs are rich in brain-healthy nutrients like choline, which supports memory and learning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002231662400289X"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; found that older adults who consumed more than one egg per week had a 47 percent reduced risk of dementia compared to those who had less than one egg in a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers, from the Rush University Memory and Aging Project in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/chicago/index.html" id="mol-b7c70501-ae68-11ef-a4f6-17bf25becc42" class=""&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, noted this was likely due to the choline in the eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another study published last month in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/19/3340"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt; looked at more than 400 adults in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-b7c70500-ae68-11ef-a4f6-17bf25becc42" class=""&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; over age 50, half of whom were diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that participants who ate eggs every day had a lower risk of dementia than those eating them only weekly or monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One large egg also contains six grams of protein, which provides amino acids needed to produce neurotransmitters like serotonin. Serotonin is crucial for cognitive function and reducing levels of toxic amyloid-beta plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Berries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Berries are rich in antioxidants, which reduce inflammation in the brain and prevent brain volume from shrinking (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strawberries, blueberries and raspberries, among others, are well known for containing antioxidants, substances that protect cells from damage caused by toxic molecules called free radicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Left unchecked, free radicals induce oxidative stress, leading to inflammation and the production of amyloid-beta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Found in the brain's gray matter, amyloid-beta builds up and forms plaques, which attack brain cells and cause overall brain volume to shrink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12743301/strawberries-dementia-risk-study.html"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; out of the University of Cincinnati found that adults between 50 and 65 who ate a cup of strawberries every day for 12 weeks performed better on memory tests and had fewer symptoms of depression than those who took a placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those researchers also published a recent study in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/8/1619/htm"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt; that found regular consumption of blueberries reduced signs of cognitive decline.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Berries are a staple of the MIND diet, a combination of the Mediterranean and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension) diets that prioritizes anti-inflammatory foods.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Dark chocolate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dark chocolate contains compounds called flavonoids, which increase blood flow to the brain and prevent damage (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chocolate is generally seen as a 'guilty pleasure' and something most people should limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in moderation, dark chocolate has been shown to lower the risk of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dark chocolate is rich in flavonoids, compounds found in plant-based foods that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, much like berries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flavonoids also increase blood flow to the brain, preventing damage and improving overall function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A bar of dark chocolate can contain anywhere from 200 milligrams to 1,000 milligrams depending on the size, manufacturer and cacao percentage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent study published in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-025-01176-1"&gt;Nature Food&lt;/a&gt; of 125,000 people found those who consumed the widest variety of flavonoids, including dark chocolate, had a 14 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/your-brain-on-chocolate-2017081612179"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that among adults ages 50 to 69, those who took a cocoa supplement with high flavanol content for three months performed better on memory tests than those who took supplements with lower flavanol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Whole grains and nuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

A &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14947279/doctors-reveal-simple-lifestyle-changes-prevent-dementia-study.html"&gt;landmark trial unveiled earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; found people at risk of developing dementia improved their cognitive scores after implementing diet changes, as well as exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, recent studies have shown foods rich in nutrients like protein, antioxidants and carbohydrates could reduce the risk the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eggs, which were &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14133867/surprising-link-eggs-dementia-risk.html"&gt;long demonized for high fat and cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, in particular are enjoying a health renaissance for containing brain-healthy amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Berries and dark, leafy greens, meanwhile are rich in antioxidants that protect brain cells responsible for memory shielded from inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And even dark chocolate may improve blood flow to the brain and boost functioning in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Daily Mail has revealed the best dementia-fighting foods below.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Studies have revealed the foods that are most likely to stave off dementia (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eggs are a key feature in the standard American diet, with more than one in three adults claiming they have them for breakfast on a given day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One large egg contains about 150 milligrams of choline, about one-quarter of the recommended daily value. Choline is an essential nutrient also found in protein sources such as salmon and beef and chicken livers that supports memory, mood and muscle control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought to boost levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which controls memory and learning, and reduce levels of neurotoxins like homocysteine that damage neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eggs are rich in brain-healthy nutrients like choline, which supports memory and learning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002231662400289X"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; found that older adults who consumed more than one egg per week had a 47 percent reduced risk of dementia compared to those who had less than one egg in a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers, from the Rush University Memory and Aging Project in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/chicago/index.html" id="mol-b7c70501-ae68-11ef-a4f6-17bf25becc42" class=""&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, noted this was likely due to the choline in the eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another study published last month in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/19/3340"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt; looked at more than 400 adults in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-b7c70500-ae68-11ef-a4f6-17bf25becc42" class=""&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; over age 50, half of whom were diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that participants who ate eggs every day had a lower risk of dementia than those eating them only weekly or monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One large egg also contains six grams of protein, which provides amino acids needed to produce neurotransmitters like serotonin. Serotonin is crucial for cognitive function and reducing levels of toxic amyloid-beta plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Berries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Berries are rich in antioxidants, which reduce inflammation in the brain and prevent brain volume from shrinking (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strawberries, blueberries and raspberries, among others, are well known for containing antioxidants, substances that protect cells from damage caused by toxic molecules called free radicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Left unchecked, free radicals induce oxidative stress, leading to inflammation and the production of amyloid-beta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Found in the brain's gray matter, amyloid-beta builds up and forms plaques, which attack brain cells and cause overall brain volume to shrink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12743301/strawberries-dementia-risk-study.html"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; out of the University of Cincinnati found that adults between 50 and 65 who ate a cup of strawberries every day for 12 weeks performed better on memory tests and had fewer symptoms of depression than those who took a placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those researchers also published a recent study in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/8/1619/htm"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt; that found regular consumption of blueberries reduced signs of cognitive decline.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Berries are a staple of the MIND diet, a combination of the Mediterranean and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stopping Hypertension) diets that prioritizes anti-inflammatory foods.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Dark chocolate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dark chocolate contains compounds called flavonoids, which increase blood flow to the brain and prevent damage (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chocolate is generally seen as a 'guilty pleasure' and something most people should limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in moderation, dark chocolate has been shown to lower the risk of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dark chocolate is rich in flavonoids, compounds found in plant-based foods that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, much like berries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flavonoids also increase blood flow to the brain, preventing damage and improving overall function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A bar of dark chocolate can contain anywhere from 200 milligrams to 1,000 milligrams depending on the size, manufacturer and cacao percentage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent study published in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-025-01176-1"&gt;Nature Food&lt;/a&gt; of 125,000 people found those who consumed the widest variety of flavonoids, including dark chocolate, had a 14 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/your-brain-on-chocolate-2017081612179"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that among adults ages 50 to 69, those who took a cocoa supplement with high flavanol content for three months performed better on memory tests than those who took supplements with lower flavanol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Whole grains and nuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

A meta-analysis of 27 randomized trials, showed that statin therapy helped reduce adverse cardiovascular events &lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2016/11/17/09/03/summarizing-the-current-state-and-evidence-on-efficacy-and-safety-of-statin-therapy#:~:text=In%20a%20meta-analysis%20of,mortality%20is%20reduced%20by%2010%25."&gt;by twenty to twenty-five percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are statins right for me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason statins are so widely prescribed is because they work. They’re often prescribed as the first level of defense. This isn't to say that they’re the only way to get your cholesterol levels down. Dropping weight, moving more, and changing your diet can also make big shifts. Still, sometimes lifestyle changes alone are not enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“​​Diet can lower LDL by about ten to fifteen percent which may be sufficient for some people to achieve their LDL goal level,” said McGowan. “However, there are many people for whom diet is insufficient either because they already have cardiovascular disease or because they have genetic conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on what your doctor advises, a combination of lifestyle changes and medications might be necessary. People more prone to heart disease or stroke, including &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/treating_cholesterol.htm#:~:text=Statin%20drugs%20lower%20LDL%20cholesterol,is%20already%20in%20the%20blood."&gt;men over forty&lt;/a&gt;, should also think more seriously about medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the side effects of statins?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statins come with a number of potential side effects. Some of these can be relatively minor like dizziness, constipation, or flatulence. They can also include things like muscle pain. More rarely, statins have been associated with things like memory loss, liver inflammation, and an increase in diabetes. Board-certified cardiologist R. Todd Hurst found that in his clinical experience side effects impacted about &lt;a data-offer-url="https://blogs.webmd.com/heart-health/20210121/considering-statins-what-a-cardiologist-wants-you-to-know" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://blogs.webmd.com/heart-health/20210121/considering-statins-what-a-cardiologist-wants-you-to-know"}' href="https://blogs.webmd.com/heart-health/20210121/considering-statins-what-a-cardiologist-wants-you-to-know" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ten percent of people&lt;/a&gt;, which was similar to the numbers found in research trials, with the most-common side effect being sore muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideally, statins are paired with a healthy lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many experts, lifestyle changes take center stage, especially as preventative measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people prefer to avoid taking medications and try to lower their cholesterol, as statins have been shown to increase cortisol, which in turn trigger a chain reaction with your body’s natural hormone production,” said Dr. Darren Clair, Chief Medical Officer at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://rebalancehealth.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://rebalancehealth.com/"}' href="https://rebalancehealth.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rebalance Health&lt;/a&gt;. “Eating a whole food plant-based diet, as well as managing stress, getting enough quality sleep, and maintaining natural, healthy hormone levels in a comprehensive manner is the best way to achieve optimal health and minimize your risk of all chronic health conditions including heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the best course of action for figuring out whether or not you should be using statins is always going to be talking things through with a medical professional and chatting about the potential cost/benefits. But if you're a person who is at higher risk for a cardiovascular event—again looking at men over forty and overweight folks—then that might be a conversation you want to be having sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class="ExternalLinkEmbedWrapper-hyhwEF gAlnVg" data-testid="external-link-embed--inline"&gt;&lt;div class="ExternalLinkEmbedText-gqUJZT bQrYnp"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE ExternalLinkEmbedRubric-hJfSsX bLcSov cpCFUv"&gt;Read More&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a attributes="[object Object]" class="external-link-embed__hed-link button" href="/story/cholesterol-explained"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE ExternalLinkEmbedHed-dDmZdb deqABF fHNWjh jMVqeX"&gt;The Good and the Bad of Cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE ExternalLinkEmbedDek-bINJOE deqABF eKqexI pjXVm"&gt;Cholesterol isn't straightforward.

&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-025-02426-1" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy&lt;/em&gt;, the team co-led by the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia, Spain (IBEC), and West China Hospital, Sichuan University, developed bioactive “supramolecular drugs” that can proactively repair the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The barrier plays an important role in the health of the brain, defending it from harmful substances and other pathogens. Alzheimer’s has been linked to a weakening of the barrier’s integrity, allowing for impairing toxins to make it through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;More specifically, the disease causes a “waste” protein, called amyloid-beta, to accumulate in the brain by interrupting its natural clearance system. The team’s approach allows these protein molecules to pass through the blood-brain barrier and be eliminated through the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In a series of experiments, the team used gene-hacked mice that produce large amounts of the protein and therefore show Alzheimer’s-like declines in cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Administered doses of the supramolecular drugs caused levels of the protein to decline almost immediately in the mice’s brains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Only one hour after the injection, we observed a reduction of 50-60 percent in amyloid-beta amount inside the brain,” said coauthor and West China Hospital of Sichuan University researcher in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-scientists-reverse-alzheimer-mice-nanoparticles.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;It’s a promising new approach to treating a disease that &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;affects over seven million Americans&lt;/a&gt; age 65 and older. Barring any breakthroughs, that number could grow to almost 14 million by 2060, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38689398/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Many treatments have been designed to clear amyloid beta, the sticky protein that builds up in Alzheimer’s brains,” principal investigator and IBEC research professor Giuseppe Battaglia &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2025/10/06/scientists-use-nanoparticles-clear-Alzheimers-brain-toxins-mice/1391759759260/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;United Press International&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Some of these can remove the plaques, but that alone hasn’t stopped memory loss or slowed the disease enough.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Our work suggests a different approach: instead of focusing solely on removing what’s already gone wrong inside the brain, we aim to repair the system that keeps the brain healthy in the first place — its blood vessels and protective barrier,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Particularly exciting: the researchers found that the cognitive improvements in the mice were substantial. A mouse that they said was roughly the equivalent of a 90-year-old human, had “recovered the behavior of a healthy mouse” after receiving the treatment six months prior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“The long-term effect comes from restoring the brain’s vasculature,” Battaglia explained in the statement. “We think it works like a cascade: when toxic species such as amyloid-beta accumulate, disease progresses. But once the vasculature is able to function again, it starts clearing Aβ and other harmful molecules, allowing the whole system to recover its balance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“What’s remarkable is that our nanoparticles act as a drug and seem to activate a feedback mechanism that brings this clearance pathway back to normal levels,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The supramolecular drugs reset the brain’s ability to pass amyloid-beta through the blood-brain barrier by mimicking the natural processes that are interrupted by Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;By renewing these waste-clearing pathways, the drugs allow levels of the harmful protein to drop — while simultaneously maintaining the brain’s vascular system for improved brain function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Restoring this barrier improves blood flow, reduces inflammation, and helps the brain recover its balance,” Battaglia told &lt;em&gt;UPI&lt;/em&gt;. “This approach could slow Alzheimer’s progression more effectively by treating one of its earliest and most overlooked causes, the breakdown of the brain’s own defense system.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;However, plenty more research still has to be done before we can trial similar approaches in humans suffering from Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“There are many ongoing efforts in animal models to find innovative methods of crossing the BBB to improve efficiency and precision for drug delivery,” Alzheimer’s Association director of scientific engagement Courtney Kloske told &lt;em&gt;UPI&lt;/em&gt;, “but we are still a long way from these technologies being proven safe and effective in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="371" data-end="579"&gt;We’ve all been told that mindfulness is the holy grail for managing anxiety. And sure—it helps. Sitting still, focusing on your breath, observing your thoughts without judgment… it sounds great in theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="581" data-end="719"&gt;But if you’ve ever tried to meditate with a racing mind, you know the struggle. Sometimes, stillness actually makes your anxiety louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="721" data-end="947"&gt;The truth is, mindfulness isn’t for everyone. Some of us need movement, texture, and engagement to calm our minds. And psychologists are increasingly recognizing that anxiety relief often comes from &lt;em data-start="920" data-end="927"&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;—not just &lt;em data-start="937" data-end="945"&gt;being.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="949" data-end="1144"&gt;That’s where these “weirdly specific” hobbies come in. They don’t just distract you; they regulate your nervous system in ways that mirror mindfulness—but often feel more natural and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1146" data-end="1286"&gt;So, if sitting in silence isn’t your thing, here are eight activities that can ground you just as deeply (and sometimes more effectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1293" data-end="1308"&gt;1) Pottery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1310" data-end="1501"&gt;There’s something deeply grounding about working with clay. It’s sensory, messy, and fully in the moment—everything mindfulness &lt;em data-start="1438" data-end="1445"&gt;tries&lt;/em&gt; to be, but without the pressure to “clear your mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1503" data-end="1801"&gt;Dr. Cathy Malchiodi, a psychologist and expressive arts therapist, explains that tactile art forms like pottery help &lt;a href="https://www.cathymalchiodi.com/resources/expressive-art-therapy-articles-links?.com"&gt;discharge emotional tension&lt;/a&gt; through the body. The rhythmic motion of shaping and smoothing activates the parasympathetic nervous system—the part responsible for rest and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1803" data-end="1999"&gt;When your hands are busy centering clay on a wheel, your brain naturally settles into a calm, focused rhythm. You’re not &lt;em data-start="1924" data-end="1934"&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; your way out of anxiety; you’re &lt;em data-start="1967" data-end="1976"&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; your way through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2001" data-end="2294"&gt;I took a pottery class a few years back after a stressful job transition. I wasn’t great at it—half my bowls collapsed like deflated soufflés—but I didn’t care. My mind was quiet for the first time in months. There’s something humbling about creating something imperfect with your own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2296" data-end="2464"&gt;That’s the secret: pottery teaches you to release control and embrace imperfection. You don’t need to make something beautiful—you just need to make something &lt;em data-start="2455" data-end="2462"&gt;real.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2471" data-end="2487"&gt;2) Foraging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2489" data-end="2550"&gt;Foraging is part mindfulness, part adventure, part therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2552" data-end="2781"&gt;When you’re wandering through the woods searching for edible mushrooms or wild herbs, your mind can’t afford to spiral. It’s fully absorbed in observation—the color of a cap, the smell of damp soil, the sound of birds overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2783" data-end="3036"&gt;Psychologists refer to this as &lt;a href="https://positivepsychology.com/attention-restoration-theory/?.com"&gt;attention restoration theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em data-start="2814" data-end="2845"&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; It suggests that time spent in natural, lightly engaging environments helps your prefrontal cortex recover from overstimulation. In plain English: nature resets your brain’s stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3038" data-end="3182"&gt;There’s also something primal and grounding about foraging—it reconnects you to a sense of agency and survival that modern life tends to dull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3184" data-end="3531"&gt;I joined a local foraging group last spring. I’ll be honest, I was mostly in it for the excuse to get outside and meet people. But after a few hikes, I noticed something unexpected: I was sleeping better, thinking clearer, and feeling calmer during the week. My therapist later said, “That’s your nervous system responding to rhythm and nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3533" data-end="3619"&gt;Turns out, you don’t have to meditate under a tree—you just have to walk among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3626" data-end="3646"&gt;3) Birdwatching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3648" data-end="3809"&gt;Birdwatching might sound like a hobby for retirees with binoculars and floppy hats—but it’s quietly one of the most effective anti-anxiety practices out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3811" data-end="4067"&gt;A 2022 study published in &lt;em data-start="189" data-end="209"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; found that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/10/221027093319.htm?.com"&gt;seeing or hearing birds&lt;/a&gt; was associated with noticeable boosts in mental well-being lasting up to eight hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4069" data-end="4305"&gt;Here’s why: birding trains your brain to shift from rumination to observation. Instead of looping on anxious thoughts, you’re scanning for movement, listening for calls, noticing details. It’s mindfulness that comes with a soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4307" data-end="4490"&gt;There’s also a subtle joy in delayed gratification. You wait, you watch, and suddenly—there it is. A flash of red, a flutter of wings, a moment that pulls you entirely into the now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4492" data-end="4701"&gt;A friend of mine started birdwatching after her therapist suggested it for social anxiety. She said, “It’s the first time I can stand in silence and not feel awkward.” That line has stuck with me ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4708" data-end="4730"&gt;4) Jigsaw puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4732" data-end="4837"&gt;Mindfulness tells you to “focus on one thing at a time.” Jigsaw puzzles make that happen automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4839" data-end="5165"&gt;The repetitive motion of sorting pieces and fitting them together triggers a state psychologists call “flow”—the same deep focus artists and athletes experience when they’re completely immersed in an activity. In this state, your brain releases dopamine, which improves mood and concentration while lowering stress hormones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5167" data-end="5443"&gt;A longitudinal trial called PACE (Jigsaw Puzzles As Cognitive Enrichment) showed that solving jigsaw puzzles strongly &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2018.00299/full?.com"&gt;engages a variety of cognitive skills&lt;/a&gt; (spatial perception, mental rotation, working memory, flexibility, reasoning) and is correlated with better visuospatial cognition—especially in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5445" data-end="5648"&gt;During lockdown, I rediscovered puzzles as a way to decompress. What started as “something to do” became my evening ritual. I noticed I was calmer, sleeping better, and far less tempted to doom-scroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5650" data-end="5852"&gt;There’s a sense of progress in puzzles that’s hard to find in daily life. Piece by piece, you remind yourself that order can emerge from chaos—and that’s a comforting metaphor for anyone with anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5859" data-end="5876"&gt;5) Gardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5878" data-end="6004"&gt;As someone who spends her weekends elbow-deep in soil, I can say with confidence: gardening is therapy disguised as a chore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6006" data-end="6146"&gt;You dig, plant, water, prune. You get sun on your face and dirt under your nails. It’s tactile and sensory—two things anxious minds crave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6148" data-end="6403"&gt;Researchers at the University of Florida found that gardening activities &lt;a href="https://biotech.ufl.edu/gardening-can-cultivate-better-mental-health/?.com"&gt;significantly reduced stress&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety, and depression in participants, even for healthy people who’d never gardened before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6405" data-end="6641"&gt;And here’s the fun part: soil contains &lt;em data-start="6444" data-end="6466"&gt;Mycobacterium vaccae&lt;/em&gt;, a natural microbe shown to boost serotonin levels—the same neurotransmitter targeted by antidepressants. So, yes, you can literally cultivate happiness from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6643" data-end="6935"&gt;One of my favorite moments each week is checking on my tomato plants at sunrise. The stillness, the smell of earth, the faint sound of bees—everything slows down. It’s not about productivity or results. It’s about remembering you’re part of something bigger and steadier than your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6942" data-end="6963"&gt;6) Improv comedy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6965" data-end="7112"&gt;At first glance, improv sounds like the last thing someone with anxiety should do. Standing in front of strangers with no script? Nightmare fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7114" data-end="7321"&gt;But psychologists are starting to use improv principles in therapy for exactly that reason. It’s controlled unpredictability. You learn to adapt, think on your feet, and—most importantly—laugh at yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7523" data-end="7757"&gt;Every time you say “yes, and…” you’re reinforcing flexibility and presence. There’s no time to overthink. You have to respond instinctively, which trains your brain to handle anxiety-provoking situations with humor instead of panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7759" data-end="8024"&gt;I tried an improv class once at a friend’s urging. I was nervous beyond belief, but halfway through, something shifted. Everyone was laughing at themselves, failing cheerfully, and cheering each other on. It was liberating. I left lighter than I’d felt in months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8026" data-end="8132"&gt;It reminded me that joy isn’t the absence of anxiety—it’s the ability to hold it loosely and still play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8139" data-end="8161"&gt;7) Model building&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8163" data-end="8301"&gt;Whether it’s assembling a miniature train set, crafting tiny houses, or designing scale models, this hobby has a strangely calming pull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8303" data-end="8592"&gt;Model building demands attention to detail, but not perfection. You measure, glue, paint, and adjust, entering what psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi famously called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29?.com"&gt;“the flow state.”&lt;/a&gt; In this zone, time blurs, and your sense of self quiets down—a physiological parallel to meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8594" data-end="8795"&gt;For people with anxiety, this kind of structured engagement provides safety and predictability. You control small, manageable outcomes, which helps restore a sense of mastery when life feels chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8797" data-end="9102"&gt;A retired engineer once told me that model shipbuilding “stills the noise.” I didn’t get it until I tried building a wooden miniature greenhouse last winter. The process was slow, precise, and oddly absorbing. When I finally snapped the roof into place, I felt a calm I hadn’t realized I’d been missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9104" data-end="9189"&gt;Sometimes what we need isn’t less stimulation—it’s the &lt;em data-start="9159" data-end="9171"&gt;right kind&lt;/em&gt; of stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="9196" data-end="9217"&gt;8) Trail running&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9219" data-end="9342"&gt;I might be biased here—I’ve been a trail runner for years—but it’s the single most reliable thing I’ve found for anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9344" data-end="9560"&gt;Unlike road running, trail running forces full-body awareness. You’re scanning roots, adjusting pace, balancing on uneven terrain. There’s no space for mental chatter because your brain is busy keeping you upright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9562" data-end="9881"&gt;Psychologists call this embodied mindfulness — a form of movement-based presence. In fact, a systematic review of rhythmic physical activity (dance, walking, etc.) showed &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/22/7084?.com"&gt;meaningful reductions in anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and improvements in quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9883" data-end="10066"&gt;I’ve had moments mid-run where I feel so in sync with my body and surroundings that everything else fades away—the deadlines, the worries, the what-ifs. Just breath, ground, rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10068" data-end="10190"&gt;And honestly, that’s what mindfulness aims for anyway: the freedom of presence. Trail running just gets me there faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="10197" data-end="10216"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10218" data-end="10381"&gt;Here’s the truth: mindfulness isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. For some of us, the quiet feels claustrophobic. For others, the stillness invites overthinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10383" data-end="10475"&gt;But that doesn’t mean we can’t experience its benefits—we just need different doorways in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10477" data-end="10677"&gt;Pottery, puzzles, foraging, gardening, even improv—they’re all mindfulness in disguise. They give your hands something to do, your senses something to engage with, and your mind a break from itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10679" data-end="10783"&gt;If sitting in silence doesn’t soothe you, stop forcing it. There’s no single “right” way to find calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10785" data-end="10913"&gt;Because sometimes the best way to quiet the mind is to give it something joyful to do—something beautifully, weirdly specific.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

School, work, screens – all of those hours on your backside add up, and our bodies don’t appreciate it one bit. A new study warns that long hours sitting causes significant health issues – even for young, active adults – raising the odds of heart disease and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if that news wasn’t bad enough, researchers also argue that today’s federal exercise recommendations don’t fully counteract the harm caused by excessive sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aging studies that focus on people in their 60s, this project zeroed in on younger adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from &lt;a href="https://www.ucr.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Riverside&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/a&gt; analyzed health data from more than 1,000 Colorado residents, with an average age of 33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-health-risks-from-prolonged-sitting"&gt;Health risks from prolonged sitting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study reports that logging eight or more seated hours a day pushes two early warning signs in the wrong direction – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-one-handful-of-pecan-nuts-each-day-can-lower-cholesterol-heart-health/"&gt;cholesterol ratio&lt;/a&gt; and body mass index (&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9464-body-mass-index-bmi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BMI&lt;/a&gt;) – even for people who work out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cholesterol ratio, which blends triglyceride and cholesterol levels to flag cardiovascular risk, and BMI, an estimate of body fat, both climbed with prolonged sitting, signaling potential trouble ahead if habits don’t change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Though unhealthy diet and smoking play a major role in increasing BMI, the full-point jump we saw in the data was just due to sitting alone,” said Ryan Bruellman, lead researcher and doctoral candidate in UCR’s Department of &lt;a href="https://genetics.ucr.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Genetics, Genomics and Bioinformatics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-twin-driven-analysis"&gt;Twin-driven analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large twin-and-sibling project examined how sitting time and exercise intensity relate to these “aging” &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/100-year-old-people-all-share-these-crucial-blood-biomarkers-that-short-lived-people-dont-have/"&gt;biomarkers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample included over a thousand adults, ages 28 to 49, with an average age in the early thirties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group mixed adopted siblings, non-adopted siblings, and both identical and fraternal twins to help separate lifestyle effects from genetics and shared upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, participants reported about 60 hours of sitting each week – roughly 8.6 hours per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men tended to report more vigorous activity and also showed higher BMI and TC/HDL cholesterol levels than women. Sitting time was roughly normally distributed across the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team modeled how BMI and TC/HDL change with age while accounting for sitting time and physical activity intensity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They made a clear distinction between “moderate” activity and “vigorous” activity because a brisk walk does not stress the body like hard running or fast cycling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also used a “co-twin control” approach: comparing one twin directly to their co-twin to reduce genetic and family-environment noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In plain terms, if an identical twin who moves harder and sits less shows better biomarker values than their genetically matched twin, behavior is a plausible contributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sitting-and-health-hard-data"&gt;Sitting and health – hard data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More sitting tracked with a drift in the wrong direction over the thirties and forties: higher BMI and a higher TC/HDL ratio. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercising-more-than-recommended-may-greatly-reduce-health-risk-of-early-death-from-any-cause/"&gt;Vigorous activity&lt;/a&gt; was shown to push those levels back to normal ranges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When models accounted for sitting time, people who did around 30 minutes of vigorous exercise per day showed BMI and TC/HDL values similar to those of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-one-minute-of-short-energy-burst-exercise-every-day-can-add-years-to-your-life/"&gt;sedentary people&lt;/a&gt; who were five to ten years younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twin comparisons reinforced this pattern. In identical and fraternal pairs, the twin who sat less and did more vigorous activity tended to show better TC/HDL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A focused test looked at identical twins who were “discordant,” meaning they differed enough in overall health, sitting times, and vigorous exercise for a fair comparison. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairs were sorted into two styles: “Active Replacers,” who swapped some sitting time for vigorous exercise; and “Active Compensators,” who sat a lot but tried to offset it with more vigorous exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The math defined an “exchange” as replacing each extra hour of weekly sitting with about six minutes of vigorous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-law-of-diminishing-returns"&gt;Law of diminishing returns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed a very clear correlation: less sitting and more vigorous movement was directly linked to a healthier TC/HDL profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits from vigorous activity showed diminishing returns. Moving from almost none to a reasonable &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/small-doses-of-exercise-can-greatly-reduce-dementia-risk/"&gt;daily dose&lt;/a&gt; mattered a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, adding more and more did not keep producing the same improvement in TC/HDL. Vigorous work can compensate for sitting to a point, yet reducing sitting still looked “paramount.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health guidance offers simple guardrails: 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week. Intensity definitely matters for certain outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For lipids and metabolic risk, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/six-minutes-of-vigorous-exercise-helps-protect-the-brain-from-aging/"&gt;vigorous minutes&lt;/a&gt; often deliver extra value. Moderate activity still counts; this result highlights where vigorous work seems especially potent for these early biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations-of-biomarkers"&gt;Limitations of biomarkers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all studies, this one had limitations. BMI and TC/HDL are informative, not definitive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were relatively young adults, so we are looking at early warning signs, not clinical disease. This was not a randomized trial; no one assigned people to sit or sprint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twin design, including the “co-twin control” comparison, adds strength beyond typical observational studies, but it cannot prove causation the way a trial can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-reported sitting time can be fuzzy. Wearable devices could sharpen future estimates and help test whether replacing specific chunks of sitting with short, vigorous bouts delivers consistent shifts in TC/HDL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vigorous-exercise-and-prolonged-sitting"&gt;Vigorous exercise and prolonged sitting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, prolonged sitting is much more damaging to human health than scientists had ever imagined, particularly in younger people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This twin-and-sibling study suggests that how much we sit and how hard we move shows up in early risk markers for heart and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-quality-could-be-the-key-to-better-metabolic-health/"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across adults in their late 20s to late 40s, more sitting was linked to higher BMI and a higher total cholesterol-to-HDL ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, regular vigorous activity pushed those numbers in a healthier direction, with roughly 30 minutes a day associated with profiles similar to sedentary people 5-10 years younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study makes it clear: if you sit for long periods, the standard exercise recommendations are not enough,” Bruellman concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All adults, even the younger ones, need to move more, and exercise harder, to counteract the impact of sitting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Break up long sitting spells. Stand more during tasks. Add walking between activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build a routine that includes some vigorous minutes most days – enough to push breathing and heart rate safely for your fitness level. Reducing sitting and adding vigorous movement worked best together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0308660#sec017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 14:23:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxORERoZy1GZFRyMHlLbTVvT0c1OFE1ZDYtbzFDNU5zMTRiNUZFOEoyVXhTWFNTZUFlbVBOSmhYTThuZTlkbHBjM3ROSWlQRzgtWWxMZFNDOTd3THFWSlFkRm05MXMtWTNmS29VaGpjWkttYjd2dnZJTVFLYkdfdF8wS1MwekNyUEo5anlUY0Q5cEFXR2pDU0VuTXREVm8zNC1kNlJ3cw</guid></item><item><title>99%的中风是可以预防的：研究显示，几乎所有心脏病患者都有这4个警告信号之一-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/99-strokes-are-preventable-study-reveals-almost-all-heart-attack-victims-have-one-of-these-4-warning-signs/photostory/124472545.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how many diseases we come across, heart attacks remain one of the scariest diseases one could encounter in their lifetime. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) – the wide umbrella of heart diseases, heart attack is a part of – are the leading cause of death globally. In fact, a 2025 American Heart Association report, which uses global data, estimates that the global prevalence of CVD was 612.06 million in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing: Heart attacks don’t always strike with sudden, dramatic chest pain. Often, your body sends quiet, everyday signals, well before a heart crisis hits. In fact, a recent American Heart Association guide lists key symptoms like chest discomfort, upper-body pain, breathlessness, cold sweating, nausea, rapid heartbeat, and lightheadedness – symptoms that may appear gradually or without the classic chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study has revealed that nearly 99% of heart attacks, strokes, or major cardiovascular events that occur in people who already had warning signs – often silent, untreated, or dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These “red flags” show up years before a crisis, which means that most incidents are not sudden or unpredictable but build up over time. In other words, almost no one’s cardiovascular event is truly “out of the blue.” Researchers found that virtually all patients showed early red flags – particularly 4 warning signs – years before their first major incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>麻疹病例在明尼苏达州攀升，这是自2000年以来美国最大规模疫情的一部分- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/measles-cases-climb-minnesota-part-130538604.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minnesota is seeing an increase in measles cases, with Dakota County reporting three new infections, bringing the state total to 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials say the latest cases involve unvaccinated children who likely contracted the virus from an unvaccinated adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC reports an average of 27 new measles cases each week nationwide since late August, with more than 1,500 cases so far this year — the highest annual total since measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases have been reported in 41 states and the District of Columbia.

The one thing that doesn’t get easier? Maintaining bone and muscle strength. “As women move through menopause, the natural decline in estrogen accelerates the loss of both muscle and bone mass,” says &lt;a href="https://erinpalinski.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re not already using strained (Greek-style) yogurt in everything from smoothies to oatmeal and chicken salad, your 50s are a perfect time to start. Reisdorf explains that it’s a rich source of protein and calcium, supporting bone and muscle health, while also supplying &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021156/foods-to-improve-gut-health-overnight/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics to support the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 7-ounce container of plain strained (Greek-style) yogurt has 20 grams of protein and 18% of the DV for calcium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Even better, choose a yogurt that is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/get-vitamin-d-without-supplement-11806255" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fortified with vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, which can help your bones absorb and use calcium more effectively.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plant-based proteins can be just as beneficial as animal-based, bringing with them a number of other valuable nutrients. “Black beans are high in both protein and soluble fiber, which helps regulate blood sugar and cholesterol,” says Reisdorf. One cup of cooked black beans has 15 grams of protein and 15 grams of fiber—more than half of the daily fiber recommendation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A half-cup serving of firm tofu provides 22 grams of protein, along with a host of other nutrients and compounds that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-that-could-help-menopause-11731702" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support premenopause and menopause symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Plant compounds [in tofu] called isoflavones may help ease menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.healthbysapna.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sapna Peruvemba, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For instance, a recent small study found that women who followed a low-fat vegan diet including soybeans experienced a 92% reduction in hot flash symptoms, while the control group saw no change. Researchers attributed this effect to the isoflavone daidzein, though other dietary factors may have also contributed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you follow a plant-based diet or just want a nutrient boost, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041388/are-lentils-healthy/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lentils are a smart choice&lt;/a&gt;. One cup of cooked lentils offers 18 grams of protein, and they can be added to soups, veggie burgers and casseroles or even mixed with ground meat in dishes like spaghetti or tacos.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “In addition to their protein content, lentils are also high in iron and fiber. Adequate iron helps prevent fatigue, while fiber supports digestive health and blood sugar control, which are all common challenges as we age,” says &lt;a href="https://janelevnutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jane Leverich, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.
