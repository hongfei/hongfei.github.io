Individuals born before 1957 are also considered immune.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Watch for symptoms. Monitor yourself for 21 days after your exposure. Look for any new symptoms including fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and rash, and contact your healthcare provider or local health department if symptoms develop. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avoid high-risk settings. If you are not immune, consider staying home to prevent the spread of measles. If you cannot remain home, avoid large gatherings or other places (like hospitals) where at-risk individuals could be. If you need medical care, call your provider ahead of time and let them know you have been exposed to measles so appropriate precautions can be taken. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Talk to a health care provider. If you have any questions about your health or immunity status, contact your health care provider. If you are not immune to measles, a healthcare provider can determine whether you can receive treatment to help prevent or lessen the severity of infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="text | text-start article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;See a spelling or grammatical error in our story? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fox19.com/page/report-typos-to-fox19/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fox19.com/page/report-typos-to-fox19/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;click here to report it&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | text-start article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a photo or video of a breaking news story?

You talk to the overwhelming majority of parents, good parents, they will take bullets for their children," the health secretary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There is that kind of innate sense of 'I will do everything I can to protect my child'. I don't think that's reflected sufficiently in the state," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The pilot scheme was part of that aim, he said, targeting families who are not signed up to a GP surgery or face language barriers, travel costs or childcare issues which stop them getting to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Uptake of childhood vaccines has declined over the past 10 years - &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/nhs-immunisation-statistics/england-2023-24" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;no jabs met the 95% coverage target for children aged five and below, according to the latest data.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Twelve areas in London, the Midlands, the North East and Yorkshire, the North West, and South West will test the approach over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The government said all other families should continue to have children vaccinated at their local surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Streeting said there had been a decline in the number of health visitors and community nursing over a number of years, and that government was developing a workforce plan to address recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Health visitors are registered nurses or midwives who have additional training in community public health nursing. They work with families with a child aged five and under to identify health needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In response to Streeting's comments, the Conservatives accused Labour of having "no plan for children's health or the health service as a whole". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Labour are trying to distract from their dismal failures by pointing the finger at the last government," shadow health secretary Stuart Andrew said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Professor Steve Turner, President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, welcomed the plan and called on the health secretary to "right the wrongs of the past".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Addressing NHS waiting times, he said it was now a "matter of routine" that children were not being seen by health professionals within the NHS's 18-week target, adding that he was "particularly astounded" that a quarter of children wait more than a year for community treatment, compared with just 1% of adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Long waits for community and elective care are unacceptable at any age, but this is especially true for children where delays can cause irreversible and lifelong harm if care isn't provided during critical developmental windows," Prof Turner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He added that the unequal treatment of adults and children "must end" by tackling obesity, protecting mental health, reducing exposure to nicotine and boosting vaccinations in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Children up to the age of six across the UK are &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c860n445vyxo" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;to be offered vaccine protection against chickenpox free on the NHS&lt;/a&gt; from January 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 00:04:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFA4NlJuTlFxNUFnQjBCS2RJdWlMS3B1Und0REZreFlXZWY2MzlTZ0RRY1pDOUtFa0lFdFYtemhLMXR5TzNtOUNaVHlLTzRiZXJXR1lLNVVTQUFwUdIBX0FVX3lxTE1ady1uMmR5YjZDSFRpQWQzakRIWWkySkRfbFNKUXVlbjRZOE5BNV9hMlpjY3VjTkRKRkswOVd2MXM1RTFXWHhZVlhGUEJGRXEwd2RlUHNWeFN6cUp5M3JV</guid></item><item><title>单次十分钟的锻炼可以阻止肠癌的进展-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/ten-minute-workout-bowel-cancer-v0lwq56tx</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-content-body" class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 kuowVf"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A ten-minute workout could halt bowel cancer growth, a study has suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Scientists from Newcastle University say physical activity protects against bowel cancer progression, and that even a short spurt of exercise could cause a rapid molecular change in the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The team, in work published in the Journal of Cancer, collected blood samples from 30 overweight or obese men who were otherwise healthy, before and after a 10 to 12-minute cycling session. They exposed &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/bowel-cancer-young-people-risk-symptoms-diagnosis-xq5tcjbhv" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt; cells to the different blood samples and measured how the cells responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The burst of exercise increased the level of 13 proteins in the blood, many of which are linked to reduced inflammation, better blood vessel function and a better metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;They found that when the blood taken&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; after exercise was applied to bowel cancer cells, 1,364 genes showed evidence of altered activity.

One bout of exercise, lasting just ten minutes, sends powerful signals to the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Genevieve Edwards, chief executive at the charity Bowel Cancer UK, said: “Extensive research shows that people who are more physically active have a lower risk of bowel cancer as well as many other cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“We should be aiming for at least 150 minutes of activity each week, such as brisk walking, cycling or swimming.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK.

						&lt;p&gt;An unvaccinated child tested positive for measles in Polk
County, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;NCDHHS said the child visited locations in Spartanburg
County, South Carolina, linked to a large ongoing measles outbreak in upstate
South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The child developed symptoms of measles before Christmas and
has since recovered. The state is not releasing any other information about the
child to protect the family’s privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;NCDHHS has been in communication with the South Carolina
Department of Public Health since the beginning of their measles response. This
is the second measles case recorded in North Carolina this year and the first
believed to be related to the South Carolina outbreak. &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/nc-first-measles-case-june-2025/"&gt;North
Carolina’s first measles case&lt;/a&gt; this year involved an international traveler
in June.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;NCDHHS recommends people 1 year and older receive a measles
vaccination to protect themselves and those around them.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Getting vaccinated against measles continues to be the most important step we can take to protect ourselves and our loved ones,” said NCDHHS State Epidemiologist Dr. Zack Moore in a news release. “It is important to check with your health care provider to ensure you are current with all your vaccines.”   &lt;/p&gt;

            The United States has reported more than 2,000 measles cases this year, federal data shows, a higher annual total than the country has seen in decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix00023b6sfx6h7tfz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ongoing outbreaks — particularly in the upstate region of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/health/measles-surge-us-south-carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; and along the border between Arizona and Utah — continue to add dozens of cases each week, threatening the measles elimination status that the US has held for a quarter-century.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix00033b6szl8e6501@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As of December 30, there have been 2,065 confirmed measles cases in the US in 2026, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The last time there were more than 2,000 cases reported in one year was in 1992, just a couple years after health leaders updated recommendations to say that children should get two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine instead of just one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix00043b6s2wad5xuk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known, but the MMR vaccine offers highly effective protection. One dose is 93% effective against measles infection, and two doses are 97% effective, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix00053b6stz20hqrt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, vaccination rates have been falling for years. Last school year, just 92.5% of incoming kindergarteners had received the MMR vaccine, CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; shows — below the 95% threshold that public health experts say is necessary to prevent outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix00063b6sxct1gmfb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles has been considered eliminated in the US since 2000, meaning no outbreaks or other chains of transmission have lasted longer than a year. But multiple large outbreaks this year may be connected, which puts the elimination status on the line if cases continue to grow through late January.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix00073b6sxdxirl7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An outbreak centered in West Texas that started in late January was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;declared over&lt;/a&gt; in mid-August. There were hundreds of related cases across Texas and New Mexico, and three unvaccinated people died: two children and one adult.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix00083b6sfdarnre0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In early October, the South Carolina health department confirmed that there was a measles outbreak in the upstate region. That outbreak has spread to nearly 180 cases over the past four months and continues to grow; at least 20 new cases have been reported since Friday, and nearly 300 people are in quarantine because of exposure to a known case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix00093b6ss9a5jdbk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know that a large number of our cases are those who we’ve placed in quarantine because of known exposures,” Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist, said Tuesday. Measles continues to spread through household transmission, in schools and at churches, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix000a3b6shehanvfe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An outbreak on the Utah-Arizona line also continues to grow, with more than 350 cases reported between the two states this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix000b3b6sm2mtvxf6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In November, the Pan American Health Organization, part of the World Health Organization, determined that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Canada had lost its measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt; amid a large ongoing outbreak there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix000c3b6sh40s4nty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s important to say that all the other 34 countries in the region, they keep their certification as measles-free,” PAHO Director Dr. Jarbas Barbosa said at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix000d3b6szfkan1xk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But possible genetic links between the Texas outbreak and the ongoing South Carolina outbreak put that status at risk for the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix000e3b6s23vtoqrn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The trajectory that we’re looking at now is that we do anticipate more cases well into January,” Bell said. “What that means for us nationally in terms of how they are defining our designation in this country as having eliminated measles is unclear.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

This time, however, it’s not COVID-19, but flu, which is also now circulating widely in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 800 people (782) in Colorado are now hospitalized with flu, that’s almost 250 more than a week ago, 430 more than two weeks ago and 12 times the number the state recorded in mid-November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total is almost 300 more than last season’s peak of around 500 in early February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers are in record-shattering territory. This same week in 2014, 582 people were hospitalized with flu, in what was the worst recent season in Colorado. That’s according to the state health department’s &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Nr7nUl8vu_yLll3lEDFcqoPiXTycjti/view"&gt;2015 flu season annual report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image article__contained size-full"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credit"&gt;Courtesy Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The 782 new flu-related hospitalizations reported for the week ending Dec. 27 is a record for raw numbers of influenza hospitalizations reported in one week since we started tracking influenza hospitalizations in 2004,” said CDPHE spokesperson Hope Shuler, in an email. “We saw a similar rate of hospitalization (40 per 100,000) during the 2024-2025 season, but that figure wasn’t reached until roughly four weeks later, in late January.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The line on this week’s flu hospitalization graph is now nearly vertical, charging almost straight up on the website of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment that tracks viral activity, which was updated Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shuler said the agency expects hospitals can handle the wave with increased staffing and surge capacity to manage increased volume. “We expect hospitalizations to continue to increase in the immediate future as a result of recent holiday gatherings and return to school, child care and work,” she said. “At this time, hospital bed capacity for adults and pediatrics remains within the ranges we would typically expect during this time of year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu season in Colorado began about four weeks earlier than usual, which follows trends seen internationally this year in the UK and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We're continuing to see steadily increasing numbers of kids with the flu with no end in sight.  Just by sheer volume, that's led to larger than normal numbers of our patients hospitalized or in the ED (emergency department) with flu-related complications like pneumonias, dehydration, and respiratory distress,” said Dr. Shen Nagel, a pediatrician with Wheat Ridge clinic Pediatrics West, via email. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We've seen a lot of our patients where flu has ripped through the whole family including higher-risk relatives like grandparents or young babies,” he said. “The only saving grace thus far … has been that other respiratory illnesses such as RSV and COVID haven't exploded yet, so thus far, no ‘tripledemic’ repeat,” Nagel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of tests coming back positive, called the weekly sentinel positivity rate, is nearly 34 percent, which means many are testing positive for flu when they show up coughing, sneezing and sniffling in hospitals, urgent cares, clinics, community health centers and doctor’s offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost 10 percent of visits to hospital emergency departments are now being diagnosed with flu and it’s showing up in all of the 21 utilities monitoring for it in wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual systems are tracking the increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As of yesterday, across our system we have 152 patients hospitalized with flu, so we’re trending higher than last flu season, when our peak was 114 in early February,” said Kelli Christensen, public &amp;amp; media relations Director with UCHealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall respiratory illness activation in Colorado is high, according to the website. The only bright spot is that so far, hospitalization for COVID-19 and RSV have remained relatively flat, with both recording about 60 hospitalizations each. But those viruses bear watching too, since all the key metrics for them are also on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado’s &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/30/nx-s1-5661508/flu-cdc-health"&gt;flu boom mirrors&lt;/a&gt; what is being seen nationally, with cases rising sharply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, last week more than 19,000 flu patients with influenza were admitted to hospitals, which was an increase of around 10,000 from the prior week, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html"&gt;new CDC data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency estimated some 7.5 million people have been sickened, and over 3,100 people have died from the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Colorado, &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/12/23/colorado-flu-season-test-vaccinate-at-home/"&gt;one child has died&lt;/a&gt; from the flu. CDPHE last week confirmed the death, an elementary school-aged child from metro Denver, as the first influenza-associated pediatric death of the 2025-26 viral respiratory disease season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older who has not yet been vaccinated this season get an annual flu vaccine. Approximately 130 million doses of influenza vaccine have been distributed in the United States this season, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html"&gt;agency’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all the news of flu illness, Coloradans are so far not taking the step that doctors say provides the best protection: getting immunized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state’s immunization numbers are woefully short of what public health officials and doctors say would provide much better community protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-seven percent of Coloradans, about 1.5 percent less than this time last year, have &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/respiratory-virus-immunization-data"&gt;received a flu vaccination&lt;/a&gt; this season, according to the state’s dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little less than half (49%) of one of the most vulnerable groups, those 65 and older, have gotten a flu shot. Of those 6 months to 9 years old, 29 percent have gotten a flu vaccine; just about 20 percent of those 10-19 years have gotten it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hispanic Coloradans are trailing other racial and ethnic groups with just over 7 percent having gotten immunized, according to the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagel said doctors and public health workers are having to clear up some public misunderstandings about this year’s vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There's been a lot of publicity about the ‘mismatch’ between the vaccine and circulating strains and, unfortunately, it seems far less about the data that even the mismatched vaccine provides up to 50-75 percent reductions in serious illness or hospitalization, especially in children,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And shorter illnesses can lead to less contagious time and decrease overall spread. So our ongoing discussions with holdouts have had to counter the resistance based on misperceptions that the vaccine isn't helping this year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the H3N2 subclade K strain — the current dominant flu strain circulating — is a slight mismatch to this year’s vaccine, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12639273/#:~:text=Influenza%20A(H3N2)%20subclade%20K%20(J.,influenza%20A(H3N2)%20viruses."&gt;early data&lt;/a&gt; remains “very encouraging,” Shuler said. “The vaccine is still performing well where it matters most, preventing about three-fourths of pediatric hospitalizations or emergency care and about a third of adult hospitalizations or emergency care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Everyday precautions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine, along with taking precautions to prevent infection, remain the most effective tools to prevent severe illness and hospitalizations, Shuler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suggests Coloradans can take everyday prevention measures to help reduce the transmission of respiratory illnesses:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="article__contained wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay home when sick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your shirt sleeve, not your hands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid close contact with others who are sick, such as kissing, shaking hands, and sharing cups and eating utensils.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as doorknobs and mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people may choose to wear a mask for protection from respiratory viruses. “Be respectful of everyone’s choices,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Colorado Public Radio</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 19:40:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9GTzMwU0lISWxtbnUzcE9OMWI2eHRxSDdKd3B2Sk9MZ1o4NmZlUzliM1lQVGNES00tbGRGV2I4ekNZUUd6MFlZUHB4ZzRhRC1hZDkyU3IzTU9mb3RYZ01BYzBoeUNOc0tuNTVKWkl3</guid></item><item><title>许多死于自杀的人没有抑郁症- futurity.org</title><link>https://www.futurity.org/suicide-depression-genetics-3319172/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="stickem-container"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Many people who die by suicide aren’t depressed, new genetic research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among friends and family of those who die by suicide, a common refrain is: I didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some people who die by suicide have prior attempts, about half of people who die by suicide have no documented suicidal thoughts or behaviors, nor do they have known psychiatric conditions associated with suicide risk, like depression. They have no previous clear indicators that they might be at risk at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need help, call 988 to reach a free, confidential 24/7 support line for suicidal crisis or emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new genetic study at the University of Utah found that people in this group of unexpected suicides aren’t just flying under the clinical radar via lower access to psychiatric services—their underlying risk factors may be fundamentally different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research found that people who die by suicide without prior non-fatal suicidal thoughts or behaviors have fewer psychiatric diagnoses and also fewer underlying genetic risk factors for psychiatric conditions compared to people who had shown these warning signs before dying by suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of people out there who may be at risk of suicide where it’s not just that you’ve missed that they’re depressed, it’s likely that they’re in fact actually not depressed,” says Hilary Coon, professor of psychiatry in the Spencer Fox Eccles School of Medicine and first author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is important in widening our view of who may be at risk. We need to start to think about aspects leading to risk in different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results, published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.38204"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, upend conventional beliefs about suicide risk and suggest new approaches to help save lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other research had shown that people who die by suicide without prior known suicidality are less likely to have psychiatric diagnoses, such as depression, compared to people with documented suicidal thoughts or behaviors. But nobody knew the root cause of this difference. Maybe, researchers thought, people without known suicidality are still just as depressed or anxious—they’re just undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Coon’s team was surprised to find that this isn’t the case. Instead, they found that this group has different genetic risk factors from people with known suicidality. By comprehensively analyzing anonymized genetic data from more than 2,700 people who died by suicide, the researchers found that people without prior suicidality tend to have fewer genetic risk factors for several psychiatric conditions, including major depressive disorder, anxiety, Alzheimer’s disease, and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genetic data also suggests that this group isn’t any more likely than the general population to have milder conditions, like depressed mood and neuroticism. This means that conventional wisdom on how to reduce suicide may need to be rethought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A tenet in suicide prevention has been that we just need to screen people better for associated conditions like depression,” Coon explains. “And if people had the same sort of underlying vulnerabilities, then additional efforts in screening might be very helpful. But for those who actually have different underlying vulnerabilities, then increasing that screening might not help for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring out how to find and treat these “hidden” at-risk individuals is a major focus of Coon’s upcoming research. Previous studies with clinical data have shown potential links between suicide risk and hard-to-treat conditions like chronic pain. Coon is also investigating how other physical disorders, such as inflammation and respiratory conditions, may impact suicide risk. Her work will also focus on traits that may confer resilience to suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coon emphasizes that, on their own, individual genetic risk factors related to suicide have very small effects on risk, and there’s no single gene—or combination of genes—that causes suicide. Environmental and societal contexts are crucial contributors to risk, and understanding the interplay between the environment and underlying biology will be essential to discovering who’s at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We hope our work will begin to define subsets of individuals at risk, and also the contexts in which these risk characteristics may be important,” Coon says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If people have a certain type of clinical diagnosis that makes them particularly vulnerable within particular environmental contexts, they still may not ever say they’re suicidal. We hope our work may help reveal traits and contexts associated with high risk so that doctors can deliver care more effectively and specifically. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better identification of at-risk individuals will help people get the care they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, Janssen Research &amp;amp; Development, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the Brain &amp;amp; Behavior Research Foundation–National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression, and the Clark Tanner Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease blood test developer Quanterix put forward new clinical data from its Simoa assay, which it described as the largest population-based assessment of the condition’s neuropathological changes to date. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Published &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09841-y"&gt;in the journal Nature&lt;/a&gt;, the research showed that the company’s ultrasensitive test for the phosphorylated tau-217 biomarker could help identify potentially higher-than-expected rates of Alzheimer’s-related dementia among older individuals—a number that rises sharply from 10% among people between ages 58 and 70 to nearly 65% in those over 90. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The company said the results also suggest its blood test could help find people at risk before symptoms begin to show, who could then seek early treatment or enroll in a clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“For decades, accurately mapping the true prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease pathology in the general population was hindered because we lacked scalable, accurate blood-based tools,” said the study’s senior author, Nicholas Ashton, Ph.D., senior director of Banner Health’s fluid biomarker program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Critically, our findings—which indicate that 10% of the 70+ population meet current treatment eligibility criteria—provide vital, actionable data for public health authorities and the pharmaceutical industry as they plan for future care and access to disease-modifying therapies,” Ashton said in a &lt;a href="https://www.quanterix.com/press-releases/quanterix-announces-landmark-nature-study-redefining-alzheimers-disease-neuropathology-prevalence/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The researchers analyzed more than 11,400 samples collected through the Norwegian Trøndelag Health trial, known as the Hunt study, which has been ongoing for more than 40 years. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Plasma pTau-217 concentrations increased with age. The study also found that about a third of the 70-plus population was affected—with 10% having preclinical Alzheimer's, 10.4% having prodromal disease and 9.8% having related dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Quanterix’s blood test was also used to rule out Alzheimer’s related changes in some cases, including in 41% of people with mild cognitive impairment and 19% of those with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The sheer scale of this research underscores the indispensable role of highly sensitive biomarker detection in advancing public health understanding,” said Quanterix CEO Masoud Toloue, Ph.D. “Our Simoa technology continues to be the enabling platform for generating population-level epidemiological insights that are necessary for planning drug development, optimizing clinical trials, and preparing healthcare systems for the future of Alzheimer’s treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The pTau-217 research assay taps into a biomarker kit from developer ALZpath, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/siemens-healthineers-taps-alzpath-alzheimers-blood-test-biomarker"&gt;licensed the antibody&lt;/a&gt; to Siemens Healthineers for use on its Atellica immunoassay platforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10" class="olytics_injection"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/fda-clears-fujirebios-blood-test-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease"&gt;cleared its first blood test&lt;/a&gt; for use in diagnosing Alzheimer’s earlier this year, with Fujirebio’s Lumipulse G that checks for pTau-217 and beta amyloid. Roche later &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/roche-nabs-fda-clearance-alzheimers-biomarker-blood-test"&gt;secured a green light&lt;/a&gt; for its pTau-181 blood test in October. &lt;/p&gt;

Brain cell damage was halted, inflammation was reduced, and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; (the brain's protective shield) was also restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were very excited and encouraged by our results," &lt;a href="https://case.edu/news/new-study-shows-alzheimers-disease-can-be-reversed-achieve-full-neurological-recovery-not-just-prevented-or-slowed-animal-models"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist and psychiatrist Andrew Pieper, from Case Western Reserve University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mouse-study-suggests-nose-picking-has-a-surprising-link-with-alzheimers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouse Study Suggests Nose-Picking Has a Surprising Link With Alzheimer's&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P7C3-A20 was selected as a neuroprotective compound known to restore the balance of NAD+ (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide"&gt;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide&lt;/a&gt;).

In fact, some of the same researchers have already demonstrated that P7C3-A20 and its NAD+ boosting powers can repair mouse brains &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2010430117"&gt;after head injuries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this follow-up study, NAD+ levels returned to normal in mice with advanced symptoms after six months of daily injections. Related biomarkers for inflammation and DNA damage also indicated there was sufficient NAD+ for cells to function normally again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested two mouse models of Alzheimer's, each related to one of the disease's two hallmark pathologies – &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;amyloid-beta protein plaques&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-study-reveals-how-toxic-clumps-warp-neurons-at-their-core"&gt;tau protein tangles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been theorized that these &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;abnormal clumps of protein&lt;/a&gt; have a role in the death of neurons and brain function disruption in Alzheimer's, though the relationship has been unclear. While P7C3-A20 restored brain function, it didn't clear out these plaques and tangles, suggesting that cells may be able to deal with the aggregated proteins if they are firing on all cylinders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Restoring the brain's energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer's," &lt;a href="https://case.edu/news/new-study-shows-alzheimers-disease-can-be-reversed-achieve-full-neurological-recovery-not-just-prevented-or-slowed-animal-models"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Pieper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the new idea that recovery from advanced disease might be possible in people with AD when the brain's NAD+ balance is restored."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a long way to go before we know whether treatments like this one can repair and reverse the damage of Alzheimer's disease in humans. That will require more animal studies and carefully designed  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="187209" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;. However, this is a clear sign that NAD+ could be a crucial factor in future treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those treatments will have to be carefully controlled and calibrated, as an overload of NAD+ has been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0463.2011.02733.x"&gt;linked to cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the past. And with a disease as complex as Alzheimer's, it's likely that a complex solution is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key takeaway is a message of hope – the effects of Alzheimer's disease may not be inevitably permanent," &lt;a href="https://case.edu/news/new-study-shows-alzheimers-disease-can-be-reversed-achieve-full-neurological-recovery-not-just-prevented-or-slowed-animal-models"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Pieper.

In South Carolina this month, a measles outbreak topped 175 cases, mostly among unvaccinated individuals, with hundreds quarantined. The resurgence of measles is seen by doctors and public health experts as a harbinger of the return of other deadly, vaccine-preventable illnesses, like whooping cough, which has killed three&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;children in Kentucky in the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css component-text" id="6K35KX4RAZEEPFAUJTSH43ZWOY" data-contentid="6K35KX4RAZEEPFAUJTSH43ZWOY"&gt;For generations, schools have required children to have proof of vaccination as a step toward protecting entire communities, starting with Massachusetts’ adoption of a school mandate&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;for the smallpox vaccine in 1855. Following the success of the polio and measles vaccines in the mid-20th Century, schools and the American public widely supported vaccination. By the 1980-1981 school year, all 50 states had vaccination laws covering students first entering school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="Image" class="wpds-c-bTCZLY wpds-c-bTCZLY-idZwvW-type-default component-image"&gt;&lt;figure id="image-FUXREBFDCXRH2K5VQUBN34U3GY" class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-iossVB-type-medium"&gt;&lt;img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FUXREBFDCXRH2K5VQUBN34U3GY_size-normalized.JPG&amp;amp;high_res=true&amp;amp;w=2048 1x" src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FUXREBFDCXRH2K5VQUBN34U3GY_size-normalized.JPG&amp;amp;high_res=true&amp;amp;w=2048"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wpds-c-kaVXjn wpds-c-kaVXjn-jBafdS-type-notLarge"&gt; Minnesota, where Becker Primary School is, has recorded one of the largest drops in vaccination rates among states since 2018.

Objections to mandates of all kinds intensified after the coronavirus pandemic, with some&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Republican-controlled states&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;taking action. This year, Florida’s governor and top health official &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/03/florida-vaccine-mandates-ended/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;announced a push&lt;/a&gt; to abolish school&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;vaccine mandates altogether,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;as the measles vaccination rate in the state fell more than 5 percent since the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css component-text" id="BBKQJN43Y5F23JMVLMBSF3UBEI" data-contentid="BBKQJN43Y5F23JMVLMBSF3UBEI"&gt;Vaccination has become such a hot-button political issue in some states that the dynamic is similar to battles over reproductive health — and local school officials don’t want to be in the crossfire, said James Colgrove, a professor at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;who has studied the role of schools in public health. That means more children will pick up infections in school and bring them home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css component-text" id="2MRLNG7SM5GR7NZM4HEVWPJ6LU" data-contentid="2MRLNG7SM5GR7NZM4HEVWPJ6LU"&gt;“The most dangerous deadly diseases will come back and it won’t only be kids who suffer,” he said. “It’ll be adults in the community who are immune-compromised, who are elderly.

Such information is not typically communicated to parents. Reporters reviewed and mapped tens of thousands of individual schools’ data, assembling the most comprehensive public database. In some states, unvaccinated rates could reflect missing immunization records for students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css component-text" id="UOHSNPOD5VHYRAPOOJHCHVX2TY" data-contentid="UOHSNPOD5VHYRAPOOJHCHVX2TY"&gt;The Post also spoke to over 75 medical experts, parents, school nurses, vaccine and anti-vaccine advocates, and contacted every state health department in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css component-text" id="EY7TW7NVBRACLHBORFXQPNEN5Y" data-contentid="EY7TW7NVBRACLHBORFXQPNEN5Y"&gt;The results showed wide variation in rates, depending on geography. While children in California, which does not allow for nonmedical vaccine exemptions, are vaccinated against measles at 96 percent, there is not a single county in Idaho,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Louisiana, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah or Wisconsin whose kindergarten rates meet herd immunity protection level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-dMWJvi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css component-text" id="3MDY5OG3JJF6FJACDNA7HCMC6U" data-contentid="3MDY5OG3JJF6FJACDNA7HCMC6U"&gt;Counties that Trump won in 2024 were more likely to lose ground on kindergarten vaccination rates in recent years than those won by then-Vice President Kamala Harris. But blue cities still saw dips as well. St. Louis reported just 74 percent of kindergartners vaccinated against measles. A quarter of kindergartners in the Ouachita Parish, Louisiana, which&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;includes the city of Monroe, are unvaccinated. In Maine, Alabama and Connecticut, vaccination rates went up since the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css component-text" id="ZW5OSXLPNRHVDNWPXMDAS6A2ME" data-contentid="ZW5OSXLPNRHVDNWPXMDAS6A2ME"&gt;“We have very different levels of health and protection based on Zip codes, and children don’t get to choose where they live or where they go to school,” said Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. “For pediatricians, immunization is a child health priority, not a partisan issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="PJLV PJLV-iWxNPu-css"&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-llABtw"&gt;A map showing the change in vax rates by county, which shows that rates decreased across the board.

To analyze how the pandemic affected rates, we examined the academic years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2023-2024 and 2024-2025. Data was gathered from publicly available government websites or through public records requests filed with state and local agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;Thirty-four states and D.C. provided school-level vaccination data. Two states — Texas and Kansas — provided district-level public school data, which creates an undercount because even the largest districts were counted as a single school in the analysis. When a state did not provide MMR-specific figures, an overall vaccination rate reflecting students up-to-date on all required vaccines was used. MMR rates reflect two doses of the vaccine, and in some states represent the vaccination for measles specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;There are several reasons certain schools are not found in the data. Many states suppressed data for schools with low student enrollment (typically less than 10 or 20 students). Some schools did not report data to the state. Also, reporters removed data reported for online or virtual schools based on school names. Vaccination rates could also be impacted by missing records for students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;The exemption rates reported for schools are not just for the MMR vaccine and in some cases reflect exemptions students received for other vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;Forty-four states and D.C. provided county-level vaccination data. In counties where school-level data was not made available, individual school vaccine rates in our database reflect a county average that is weighted by enrollment. If student enrollment data was not provided, reporters collected it from National Center for Education Statistics databases. In some cases, the state provided data based on geography other than counties; reporters translated these to county-equivalent regions for mapping and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;For county and school-level data, “post-pandemic” typically refers to the 2024-2025 school year, but some states provided only 2023-2024 data. “Pre-pandemic” years include school years starting in 2018 or 2019. Some states’ rates did not differentiate between kindergartners and students in other grades; when grades above kindergarten are included, that is stated in the state-specific notes in the interactive map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;For statewide vaccination and exemption rates, reporters used CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from 2018 and 2024, with the exception of Montana (no post-pandemic data), Alaska (pre-pandemic year is 2017), the&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;District of Columbia (pre-pandemic year is 2015) and West Virginia (post-pandemic year is 2023). The CDC’s reported vaccination rates are based on a survey of a representative sample of schools in each state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;In roughly two dozen states where exact school addresses weren’t provided, reporters geocoded each building in the following manner: First, schools were matched to National Center for Education Statistics data. Those without a close match were then searched for location matches using Google and Geocodio tools. Those that still didn’t match to a street address were checked by hand. In several states, a number of schools listed no exact addresses, were not included in federal datasets and did not appear in web searches. Those were geocoded to the center of the nearest geography provided — either a street, city or county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;County-level or school-level kindergarten vaccination rates were considered to be below herd immunity if they were less than 95 percent. To calculate the number of kindergarten-age children in counties that fell below herd immunity, reporters used the Census Bureau’s current population estimates for 5- and 6-year-olds. To measure the political split of counties, reporters used 2024 presidential vote margins. To calculate the number of schools below herd immunity, we used&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the most recent year provided by each state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;For more detailed methodological notes and to download this data, click &lt;a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-school-vaccination-rates?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 18:00:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPQURuZkNzaW5wa2RuUk5zRFdROXpIcFN6dG5TajJfeVI2MlJaejVPUEtEeExkalBQQUdRTVp3ZERSWlNxVXdyZGFJdlB0RFllYUNYSEkxa2xPTVh3cHNQNHBfUGg3cmF0TzliSGlYYWJycUI3MjdqaXhxZ1hwUktwcDBqNE1jekNCVGlvQXhobkFtOWVuOWlnZ2tuaTFkTGpIUU1pNklR</guid></item><item><title>《每日邮报》图片揭示了瓶装水中最致癌的“永久化学物质” --《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15423263/bottled-water-PFAS-forever-chemicals.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bottled water is typically seen as the safer drinking choice compared to tap water, as it is filtered, free of lead, agricultural pesticides and industrial pollutants that might not be fully weeded out of municipal systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14292761/scientists-reveal-tap-bottled-water-safer-toxic-chemicals.html"&gt;lab tests have shown&lt;/a&gt; that, contrary to popular opinion, a pricier bottle does not mean purer water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, tests commissioned by the consumer watchdog app Oasis Health found plastic-derived 'forever chemicals' to be ubiquitous in bottled water, from budget-friendly brands like Deer Park and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/poland/index.html" id="mol-23895320-e5bc-11f0-a88e-171c7d23bae2"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; Spring to upmarket favorites such as Essentia and Topo Chico. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forever chemicals, known for repelling water and stains, coat the insides of plastic water bottles and their caps to prevent leaks. They are byproducts of plastic production that can take decades or even centuries to break down in both the environment and the human body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, these chemicals accumulate in the environment and the body, seeping into the water and food supply, becoming ubiquitous. When PFAS accumulate in the body's tissues, they disrupt essential biological processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes interfering with hormone regulation, sabotaging the body’s ability to clear out bad cholesterol, promoting cancer-causing inflammation and, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13052757/plastic-containers-premature-birth-toxic-forever-chemicals.html"&gt;in pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;, disrupting fetal development, potentially leading to learning and developmental delays later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plastic is known to be full of forever chemicals, and many people choose glass bottles to avoid the toxins, but now, testing has revealed that even water in glass bottles is not safe from PFAS contamination, which can also occur during the purification process, when water is stored or filtered through plastic systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bottled water is marketed as a clean escape from tap water contaminants like lead and pesticides. Yet lab tests prove a higher price does not mean purer water (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The EPA sets a PFAS exposure limit at 0.4 parts per trillion (ppt), but the health guideline most researchers agree on is 0.1 ppt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oasis analysts scored thousands of bottled water brands, including Deer Park, SmartWater, Dasani and Fiji, among others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scoring methodology is a comprehensive, points-based system. For each product, a base score out of 100 is adjusted using penalties for risks and bonuses for transparency. The closer their ranking got to 100, the less contaminated they were. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, bottled water is penalized for missing third-party lab reports, the presence of contaminants, unsafe packaging materials, like certain plastics, or sourcing from municipal supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bonuses are awarded for brand transparency, like publishing test data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The final score places the product into a clear risk band, from ‘Excellent’ (90–100) to ‘Very Poor’ (below 60), providing a standardized, science-backed way for consumers to compare the health safety of products within the same category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most instances, Oasis analysts did not specify the types of forever chemicals found in different bottles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS is a category that encompasses hundreds of molecules, each with its own risk profile, some known and some unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without knowing the specific chemical involved, it is difficult to gauge the risk associated with picking up a bottle of that water at the store.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFOA, a type of PFAS for instance, has strong links to kidney and testicular cancer, as well as liver damage and thyroid disease. PFOS, another type of forever chemical, is most closely associated with kidney and thyroid cancer, as well as liver damage and high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of the worst performers contained PFAS concentrations of about 0.2 ppt, which is roughly double the health guideline for the chemicals agreed upon by environmental scientists across a wide body of research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, there were two stand outs with even worse scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Topo Chico, 3.9 ppt, and Perrier, 1.7 ppt, had PFAS concentrations 39 times and 17 times the safe limit, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Deer Park, 1.21 ppt, had PFAS concentrations at 12 times the safe limit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Essentia, Dasani, Smartwater and Aquafina, also each contained PFAS at a level of 0.2 parts per trillion (ppt).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fiji was the only product that didn't exceed PFAS levels, with 0.05 ppt, but it did test positive for arsenic.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this trace amount is extremely low, it is still twice the EPA's stringent 0.004 ppt health advisory goal for PFOA, one of the most toxic PFAS chemicals. This indicates that even waters marketed as pure or enhanced contain these persistent industrial pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most alarming was Perrier Sparkling Water's high concentration of HFPO-DA (also known as GenX), a common PFOA replacement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research, though less extensive than for PFOA or PFOS, indicates concerning health effects of GenX exposure. Animal studies have pointed to an elevated risk of liver toxicity, lesions in the kidneys and atrophied pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GenX is likely carcinogenic in humans, according to the EPA, based on animal studies that have linked the chemical to liver, pancreas and testicular tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS is a common contaminant in many household items from cookware to hamburger wrappers. It can remain in the environment as well as human tissue for years, even decades, before being cleared out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many public health experts and organizations argue that there is no truly safe level of exposure to PFAS like PFOA and PFOS due to their extreme persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity at very low doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The problem is escalating as scientists link harmful health effects to increasingly minuscule PFAS concentrations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, official ‘safe’ limits for these chemicals in drinking water become obsolete almost as soon as they are set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, the EPA's recommended limit for PFOA alone has plummeted from 400 ppt in 2009 to 70 ppt in 2016; today, some states enforce limits as low as 0.1 ppt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This drastic tightening applies to just one of thousands of PFAS compounds. Research shows people typically carry a mixture of multiple PFAS in their bodies simultaneously. It is now believed that over 200 million Americans have PFAS in their tap water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 17:44:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQTHQ4ejhKVXBfa01tQ0s5LTRrWUdabXkzNUhHY3EyUzVUVTdaVl9qakZYaUlvcDBtNE92U1FtQXpueUNLY21FY3FOZUpOcXZrczFYcGNfVmdkM1lPbDJsUFF4ODNkRW1lMXNINkNIVXJMNjlvc1V0cGRfMXgzbGwxd2xfQXBodE1SZG5VSzFxbG9Zb0pKNmQ0dtIBngFBVV95cUxPVDVnZnBzR1NSY0ozUFpGZGh0Uk5UZVkySEZRRkdNRFA4Z0ZIdzItLXZvWFZ5UC1CYTZxVUlNbkFPRDJkalp6RlIwMUNXNjZYaW9XRmU1ZkI4UlRaNDktNlRGdy1IV1lpSGx4SEVPNm9EblNjNC01bzB4OGhCQlBVbHNqNmQ0ZUU2UXlvUE1Hb1Y1cE9JdWdEdDJFeVVvdw</guid></item><item><title>这个7分钟的早晨站立例行公事在50岁后的30天内收缩肚子狗-吃这个不是那个</title><link>https://www.eatthis.com/7-minute-morning-standing-routine-belly-pooch-after-50/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;

They’re a productive way to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/functional-strength-exercises-for-mobility/" target="_blank"&gt;boost functional strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-exercises-core-strength-better-than-planks-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;core stability&lt;/a&gt; while improving mobility, posture, and balance. Because &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/standing-strength-exercises-fight-muscle-loss-after-45/" target="_blank"&gt;standing exercises&lt;/a&gt; activate more muscle groups than seated workouts, they also give your circulation and metabolism noticeable improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke with experts who share how standing moves can help &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/chair-exercises-shrink-belly-pooch-over-50-no-planks/" target="_blank"&gt;shrink your belly pooch&lt;/a&gt; in 30 days after the age of 50. The best part? A productive workout can take just seven minutes out of your morning—which makes it easy to stay consistent to reach your goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes exercising in the morning so productive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;b&gt;Karen Ann Canham&lt;/b&gt;, CEO and founder of&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://www.karenannwellness.com/" target="_blank"&gt; Karen Ann Wellness&lt;/a&gt;, “&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/morning-moves-stronger-than-30-year-olds-after-55/" target="_blank"&gt;Morning movement&lt;/a&gt; is effective because cortisol levels are naturally higher which helps mobilize stored fat. The body is also less inflamed after rest which allows the core muscles to engage more easily. Moving early improves insulin sensitivity which supports fat loss. Morning routines set posture and alignment for the entire day. This reduces tension patterns that contribute to belly pooch. Energy levels are often steadier before daily stress accumulates. Consistent morning movement creates momentum that supports long-term change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seven-minute workout below features dynamic movements like squats, jumping jacks, marches, and knee-to-elbow crunches. Each exercise is typically performed for 40 seconds with 20 seconds of rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This provides a continuous, heart-pumping, core-engaging routine that boosts metabolism to help melt visceral belly fat and improve overall fitness without floor work,” explains &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://thwarrior.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Eric North&lt;/a&gt;, aka The Happiness Warrior—a wellness speaker, coach, and advocate redefining what it means to age with purpose, strength, and emotional vitality. “Remember to learn to listen to our bodies, go at our own pace and ALWAYS consult a physician before committing to an intense exercise program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perform each exercise for 40 seconds, resting for 20 seconds between each move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jumping Jacks (Or Step Jacks for a Lower-Impact Alternative):&lt;/b&gt; This exercise increases your heart rate and puts your entire body to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bodyweight Squats:&lt;/b&gt; North encourages you to emphasize proper form, descending as if you’re about to sit on a chair. Increase the challenge by performing deep squats, increasing and lengthening the squat position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plank Shoulder Taps:&lt;/b&gt; This core stability move requires assuming a plank position, then alternating tapping opposite shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reverse Lunges:&lt;/b&gt; For this move, you’ll step back and lower into a lunge—keeping your front knee over your ankle—then, you’ll press back up to the start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mountain Climbers (Or Marching in Place):&lt;/b&gt; For this exercise, you’ll alternate driving a knee toward your chest in a swift yet controlled motion from a high plank.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Standing Knee-To-Elbow Crunches: &lt;/b&gt;For this move, you’ll lift one knee up to the opposite elbow, activating the side obliques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forearm Plank Hold (or Wall Plank):&lt;/b&gt; This classic exercise is great for building core strength. Feel free to modify it to a wall plank, if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Standing core work challenges our core to fight gravity and maintain balance while engaging more stabilizer muscles (hips, pelvic floor, back) for functional stability,” North tells us. “While floor exercises offer more stability to isolate deeper core muscles, making them great for building foundational strength and for beginners, standing movements emulate daily activities better, building functional strength, power, and balance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Emphasize form: Prioritizing quality of movement over speed is crucial for preventing injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider low-impact options: Opt for wall pushups, marches, or chair-assisted moves, if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency is essential: Aim to perform this seven-minute routine for fat loss and improved health markers, such as insulin sensitivity, on a regular basis.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjrtghn100183b78t1t27er3@published"&gt;My husband and I were out at a restaurant several days ago. Midway through dinner, he took my hand and put it under the table. I felt my eyes get wide as I realized what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;

    


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjrthq2l00253b783popp7pd@published"&gt;When he put my hand down there, I felt his hard-on, which he had exposed. He then asked me to give him a hand job (fortunately the tablecloth obstructed the view). I wanted to avoid getting caught, so I complied and got him off quickly. When we got to the car he said it was the most thrilling sexual experience he’s had in ages and wants to do it again. Now I’m afraid to go anywhere with him that might afford him the opportunity. What can I do other than refuse to go places where he might try it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="172" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjrtghxb001b3b78a4gne7cz@published"&gt;It’s completely reasonable for a number of reasons to not want to repeat that, but you don’t specify any in your letter. Just make sure you can articulate exactly why you want to avoid this situation moving forward. “It makes me uncomfortable to engage in public sexual behavior, which could lead to negative consequences,” for example, is more than justified rationale. “It makes me uncomfortable,” is more than justified rationale, period, but it does help to have an explanation to share with one’s partner so that you can be fully understood and so that the conversation about this doesn’t become an ongoing one, with your husband regularly bringing it up/begging you to participate. If you need to take some time to work out exactly what about that you didn’t like, do so. And then get back to him. And if he presses, indeed tell him that you will start to refuse going into public spaces with him. You aren’t into it and you shouldn’t have to do anything that you aren’t into.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjrtgi0i001c3b78rc33xw4d@published"&gt;If there are semi-public alternatives, like a swingers club or sex parties, that you’d be more into, maybe suggest those. I don’t know if they’d fly with him—likely part of the thrill was indeed the risk of getting caught, which means you might be squarely at odds with your husband here. But that’s too bad for him. He wants something, you don’t, your refusal to consent is where this fantasy is blocked from becoming a reality (at least with your participation). Sucks for him, but them’s the breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, she revealed that what she told me about her first marriage had been a complete lie. Worse, to me, she refused to have a rational conversation about it—either together or in therapy. It turns out that rather than one affair with a married man at the end of a nine-year marriage, she had &lt;em&gt;four affairs&lt;/em&gt; with different men across the nine years. I have been shaken to the core. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/10/second-marriage-husband-wife-relationship-history.html"&gt;How can I trust her?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru012800193b78wdg95iej@published"&gt;I’m a woman with a thing for bisexual men and I have multiple boyfriends at the moment. Two of them frequent the local gay bathhouse but only give and receive oral sex there. I am their only female sex partner.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru015r001a3b781o3puvj0@published"&gt;I am wondering if it’s especially dangerous for me to have unprotected oral and vaginal sex with these men considering the fact that they are giving and receiving unprotected oral with men anonymously. I know that there is always some risk involved, but aside from the virus that causes genital warts, are there any other STIs that I am at high risk for getting?&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="19" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru019p001b3b7809i4ppci@published"&gt;We do get tested regularly but I don’t know if normal tests would show an infection of the throat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru01k7001e3b7820pngeen@published"&gt;“High risk” is a bit of a fuzzy concept here because of the medical interventions that science and technology have afforded us. Doxy PEP (that is antibiotic therapy taken after potential exposure) reduces the risk of contracting bacterial STIs like syphilis and chlamydia (and, &lt;a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/news/mar-2024/full-analysis-french-sti-study-dashes-hopes-gonorrhoea-vaccine"&gt;perhaps to a lesser degree&lt;/a&gt;, gonorrhea). If your guys are on this, their risk is lowered and yours would be as well. There is little risk of contracting HIV via oral, but PrEP could also potentially help with this, as regular STI testing is part of the regimen. That can catch STIs that are asymptomatic and would have gone otherwise undetected.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru01o7001f3b78ytvnk79a@published"&gt;HPV is certainly a risk, though given your sexual activity, you have likely already been exposed to it (the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer"&gt;overwhelming majority&lt;/a&gt; of sexually active people have been). Herpes, too. There are also lesser discussed infections like trichomoniasis, shigella, and giardia (the latter two generally come from anal contact).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru01s0001g3b78rzynaqra@published"&gt;The simple fact is that to some degree, you’re at risk for all of this. So are your partners. Highly sexually active partners may create more opportunities for these infections, but all it takes is one act to contract one (or more). This is the risk you assume when you have sex with someone. Routine testing and the medical interventions described above can help (note that doxy PEP has only been CDC-&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/rr/rr7302a1.htm"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; for cis men and trans women). If your STI testing doesn’t include throat and rectal swabs, you can certainly request them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru14i4002m3b784mgrwpwa@published"&gt;My wife and I have had only very vanilla sex for our 40+ years of marriage. Very enjoyable, but not as exciting as it used to be. It is pretty much always the same. And I am always the one initiating.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="57" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru14i4002n3b78ad8w9xg2@published"&gt;I have gladly given her oral during our pre-marriage and married years, as I enjoy giving it as much as she enjoys receiving it. However, she has never reciprocated or even asked if I’d like her to do that. I haven’t ever asked her why. I know I should. I’m just afraid of a negative reaction if I ask.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru14i4002o3b78m5tihtwb@published"&gt;I have also asked her many times if she has anything different that she would like me to do or for her. Her answer has always been that she is very happy with what we do now. She has never asked me if there is anything that I would like her to me. Ditto to my fear above.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru14i4002p3b78c40u04pq@published"&gt;I have two fetishes that I would like my wife to perform. One is to tie up my cock and balls, then jerk me off. The other is to incorporate her smoking a cigarette during our intimacy and foreplay. I have asked her if she would be willing to smoke a cigarette. Her answer was a hard no. I know the tying up of my genitals is a wholly different level of ask.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru14i4002u3b78gagdi9gb@published"&gt;You are a living embodiment of the quote (sometimes attributed to Madonna) that goes: People don’t get what they want because they don’t ask for it. You have two choices. You can continue to live in fear of rejection and not get what you’re looking for sexually, or you can challenge that fear, ask your wife for what you want, and maybe not get it. More importantly, &lt;em&gt;maybe you will get it&lt;/em&gt;. It’s an uncertain outcome, but if you keep going the way that you are, you will certainly not get the experiences that you seek.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="164" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru14i5002v3b78lt7d90oj@published"&gt;It sounds like you’ve been extremely considerate toward your wife, to the point of over-politeness. Hold onto that love and compassion, and extend some to yourself. Your wife turned down your request to smoke a cigarette during sex, and while I understand what you mean about tying up your genitals being “a wholly different level of ask,” life isn’t a video game. There isn’t an A to B progression when it comes to sex acts. There isn’t always logic to apply to what people are and aren’t into. On top of that, there are reasons to refrain from smoking a cigarette that have nothing to do with sex—maybe your wife doesn’t like the smell or how cigarettes make her feel. Maybe she just finds cigarettes generally disgusting. I can relate to this way of thinking—I would put just about any penis in my mouth before I would put a cigarette in it. As you can surmise, I’m not a prude; I just loathe cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;

Ask her about oral. See if she will allow you to engage her in what are sometimes difficult or uncomfortable conversations. It sounds like she is entirely satisfied with your sex life, which is a wonderful thing. Emphasize that you have found it very enjoyable as well—so enjoyable that you’d like to explore a bit more with her, since she’s been such a wonderful partner. She may turn you down entirely, which is her right, but if you keep things kind and positive, she will be way more likely to at least hear you out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3auh004c3b78ykoc63vz@published"&gt;I had prostate surgery three years ago and have still not been able to get back to my normal sex life. Before prostate cancer, my wife and I had sex three to five times a week. Sometimes it was quickies; other times it was longer play. We are both in our 60s.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004d3b78f15cl9im@published"&gt;The doctor has prescribed pills and pumps and cock rings, but they don’t sustain my erection long enough to satisfy my wife.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004e3b78adqueefc@published"&gt;My question is this: When we travel to Europe, I can’t take Trimix with me. It has to stay refrigerated and you have to declare it, making for an embarrassing discussion at customs. I am wondering if a penis sleeve that could go over my flaccid cock but be rigid enough for sex, including anal, is a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="18" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004f3b78vb6lwtfe@published"&gt;The internet is full of dildo-style toys, but I’m looking for something more specific. Any advice would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="6" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004g3b78j68np8fw@published"&gt;—To Sleeve or Not to Sleeve&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="7" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004h3b78b8h1filu@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear To Sleeve or Not to Sleeve,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004i3b78yltyilds@published"&gt;Congrats on finding a solution for you—post-prostatectomy sex can be very difficult to navigate. It’s generally not a topic of mainstream conversation, and though many options exist, not all work for everyone, as you know well. But you found a way. The good news is that even if you were to find no suitable alternative for your trip to Europe, that trip is only temporary and you will soon return home to your Trimix, which you don’t have to discuss with anyone (though I’m assuming your wife is aware). The problem here will resolve even without the solution that your letter seeks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="133" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004j3b78u455357x@published"&gt;I think a sleeve is definitely worth a try. These range in price. You could get a relatively inexpensive one like &lt;a href="https://www.adameve.com/adult-sex-toys/penis-enhancers/sp-adams-extension-by-adam-eve-89865.aspx"&gt;Adam’s Extension&lt;/a&gt;, which has nubs outside (for her) and inside (which may provide stimulation to you). Higher end ones like &lt;a href="https://rxsleeve.com/collections/penis-sleeves"&gt;those from RX Sleeve&lt;/a&gt; could set you back a few hundred or even more, depending on your desired level of &lt;a href="https://rxsleeve.com/pages/custom"&gt;customization&lt;/a&gt;. (With that brand specifically, there is a chance of &lt;a href="https://rxsleeve.com/pages/insurance"&gt;insurance reimbursement&lt;/a&gt;.) Keep in mind that the data on these is not robust, but the authors of the 2017 paper “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5715194/"&gt;Non-pharmacological and non-surgical strategies to promote sexual recovery for men with erectile dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;” did not consider that to be invalidating. “Studies on these aids are admittedly sparse and mostly anecdotal, but that should not preclude considering them as therapeutic options,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004k3b78hsbcmtsy@published"&gt;Another option in that paper that you might want to consider is &lt;a href="https://www.theelator.com/pages/how-to-attach"&gt;The Elator&lt;/a&gt;, an “external penile support device.” This allows penetration without an erection via a rod that runs along the bottom of the penis that’s attached via rings at the base and around the head. The price point is in the $300 range. There is also the option of a strap-on, which is typically a dildo connected to your body via harness. Typically, the penis does not go into the penetrating object (unlike a sleeve, though the RX Sleeve also attaches via harness).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004l3b78shlk826y@published"&gt;“What’s the point?” you may be asking, but according to the authors of the above cited paper, “case reports indicate that an external prosthesis, when incorporated in penetrative sex, may recreate the sensory experience of coital sex without the patient needing the penile rigidity for intercourse.” Your partner could play with your penis while you penetrate her with the dildo, but also the entire experience could get you in the headspace of penetrative sex.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="4" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3auj004m3b78gsh2ro3b@published"&gt;So say the authors:&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;blockquote data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-blockquote/instances/cmjru3xut005b3b7887ji0i39@published" class="slate-blockquote" data-word-count="75"&gt;
  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For men who are adventurous and attuned to the totality of sensory stimulation during sex, the sensory experience achieved during intercourse with an external penile prosthesis may closely match the sensory experience of normal coitus and lead to orgasm. Use of the prosthesis can empower patients who accept the prosthesis as part of themselves, much the same way that well-adapted wheel-chair dependent patients come to accept their chair as an extension of who they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3auj004o3b78ux2fy69h@published"&gt;I find that fascinating. Maybe you will, too. The paper is well worth reading, as the benefits of these non-medical ED options are well articulated and it may also give you more ideas. For example, the authors stress the importance of including your partner in selecting and using these devices (setting them up/putting them into place may be a form of foreplay). They write:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-blockquote/instances/cmjru4aje005l3b786nmj2xqg@published" class="slate-blockquote" data-word-count="74"&gt;
  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Involving partners in such activities can build intimacy in a broad sense, even when the aids do not restore full erection. This is predicated on the fact that intimacy can be considered as something a couple shares with each other and no one else. While penetrative sex may be considered archetypal intimate act, a simple activity of shopping together for sex aids is still an intimate act that can thus strengthen co-supportive spousal/partner bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berberine (from plants such as &lt;em&gt;Berberis&lt;/em&gt;) has &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-long-does-it-take-for-berberine-to-lower-your-blood-sugar-11788249" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood sugar (glucose)-lowering effects&lt;/a&gt; and is sometimes used as a “natural” alternative to metformin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies and reviews have shown similar mechanisms between berberine and metformin. For example, both can help reduce the amount of glucose produced by your liver.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This can lead to additive or synergistic effects when taken together, so your blood sugar may drop too low. The similar effects also mean that GI side effects can be worsened.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Talk to your healthcare provider before planning to take berberine. If you are also taking metformin or another glucose-lowering medication, you may need to closely monitor your blood sugar levels and review your dosing with your provider.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-cinnamon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Cinnamon &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cinnamon can increase the risk of low blood sugar when combined with medications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cinnamon and cinnamon extracts have been reported in multiple trials and reviews to modestly lower fasting glucose and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/a1c-chart-8631159" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;hemoglobin A1c&lt;/a&gt; (average blood sugar level over two or three months) in some people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This effect means that cinnamon supplements can enhance the glucose-lowering effect of prescription medications, such as sulfonylureas or insulin, especially when taken in concentrated form rather than as a sprinkle of the spice. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Clinical evidence is mixed, but caution is warranted. "Natural” doesn’t mean harmless, and you should check your blood glucose more often if you start taking a cinnamon supplement.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-ginseng"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Ginseng &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unpredictable effects mean ginseng may increase or decrease the effect of prescription diabetes medications.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Different ginseng preparations (e.g., American, Asian) and study designs produce inconsistent results, but studies show that ginseng can affect insulin secretion, glucose uptake, and postprandial (after a meal) glucose.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In individuals already taking oral blood sugar-lowering drugs or insulin, ginseng may have the potential to cause additive glucose-lowering effects, which can lead to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/hypoglycemia-symptoms-1298883" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;hypoglycemia (too low blood sugar),&lt;/a&gt; or alter their responses to these medications.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Commercial ginseng products can vary widely in potency and formulation. Be sure to consult with your healthcare provider before starting this supplement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-st-johns-wort"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. St. John's Wort &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; St. John's wort may change drug metabolism, affecting how much of your diabetes medications get absorbed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-st-johns-wort-7556278" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;St. John’s wort&lt;/a&gt; increases the activity of CYP3A4 (a drug-metabolizing enzyme in the body) and certain drug transporters (proteins responsible for drug absorption, distribution, and elimination). As a result, it can reduce the blood levels of medications that share these pathways. For this reason, it is notorious for interacting with many different medications. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While many &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/medications-for-type-2-diabetes-7642774" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diabetes drugs&lt;/a&gt; do not get broken down by the CYP3A4 enzyme, St. John’s wort has been shown to alter the way metformin works in your body in at least one trial. It can also interact with many other medications.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because of its unpredictability with interactions, it's recommended to avoid combining St. John’s wort with complex medication regimens without supervision from your healthcare provider.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-aloe-vera"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 5. Aloe Vera &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aloe vera can lower glucose and interact with diabetes medications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aloe vera has been studied for its effects on processes that contribute to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/hyperglycemia-symptoms-and-signs-11852484" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;. Studies suggest that it may be beneficial in reducing fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels, particularly in stabilizing blood sugar levels after meals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, the extent to which aloe vera affects blood sugar levels is unknown. Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking an aloe vera supplement. Keep in mind that aloe vera formulations also vary, and some can cause side effects, such as GI upset.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/chromium-benefits-4588421" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chromium supplementation&lt;/a&gt; has shown modest improvements in &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/chromium-benefits-4588421" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; and hemoglobin A1c in some studies.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Other studies have shown benefit only in people with poor nutritional status or already low chromium levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because chromium can enhance insulin action, using it with a prescription blood sugar-lowering drug can raise the risk of hypoglycemia, especially if the doses are higher than those found in multivitamins.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Institute of Medicine, it is safe when taken at a dose of 200 micrograms daily for up to six months.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keep in mind, chromium supplements may also carry side effect risks like GI upset or headaches. Caution should be used if you have kidney or liver issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Talk to your healthcare provider about whether chromium supplements may be beneficial for you.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was released during October's ADHD Awareness Month, which this year highlights "the many faces of ADHD." Scientists from the University of Bath, King's College London, and Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands collaborated on the first large-scale effort to measure psychological strengths associated with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large Study Compares Strengths in Adults With and Without ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in Psychological Medicine, the study examined 200 adults diagnosed with ADHD and 200 adults without ADHD. Participants were asked how strongly they identified with 25 positive traits, including creativity, humor, spontaneity and hyperfocus. Researchers defined these traits as "things [they] do well or best."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD is commonly discussed in terms of difficulties such as impulsivity, forgetfulness, and trouble sustaining attention. This study points to a different perspective by emphasizing the importance of recognizing and making use of strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luca Hargitai, lead researcher from the Department of Psychology at the University of Bath, said: "These exciting findings give us an indication of which positive qualities may be tied to ADHD and thus can be considered ADHD-related strengths. It can be really empowering to recognise that, while ADHD is associated with various difficulties, it does have several positive aspects."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Strengths More Commonly Endorsed by Adults With ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with participants without ADHD, those with ADHD were more likely to strongly identify with 10 specific strengths. These included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Hyperfocus (deep concentration on tasks of interest)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Humor&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Creativity&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Spontaneity&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Intuitiveness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the well-documented challenges adults with ADHD often face in work, relationships, and mental health, the study found they were just as likely as neurotypical participants to recognize and use their strengths in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Strengths Tied to Better Mental Health Across Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across both groups, individuals who had greater awareness of their strengths and applied them more frequently reported clear benefits. These included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Higher subjective well-being&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Better quality of life (across physical, psychological, social and environmental domains)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Fewer symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Punit Shah, senior author and Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Bath, said: "Our findings highlight that knowing that we have certain skills and positive qualities at our disposal and using these strengths where appropriate can be beneficial for our well-being. This might sound obvious, but now that our research confirms this hypothesis, we can start designing psychological supports with this fresh evidence."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Strengths-Based Approaches in ADHD Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results add weight to strengths-based approaches in mental health care. While this framework is increasingly used in autism services, it has received far less attention in ADHD. Potential applications include psychoeducational programs, coaching, and customized therapies that help people identify and apply their strengths more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shah added: "The next step now is to investigate whether interventions that promote the recognition and use of personal strengths can offer tangible improvements in mental wellbeing for adults with ADHD. People with ADHD and other neurodivergences have been calling for this for a long time and we are excited to have some of the first research to support this."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Comparing ADHD and Neurotypical Strengths Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior author Assistant Professor Martine Hoogman of Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands emphasized that research into ADHD-related strengths is still developing. She noted that many previous studies focused only on people with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Research on ADHD-related strengths is still in its early stages. Most studies ask only people with ADHD about their strengths, but we also asked neurotypical people. We found that people without ADHD recognise many of the same strengths, though only those with ADHD endorse some of them. This helps us better understand ADHD strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's important to educate people with ADHD not just about challenges, but also about their potential strengths to improve quality of life and reduce risks in work or education."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was supported by funding from the UK Economic and Social Research Council and the Dutch Research Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The U.S. research enterprise has been scrambled by a series of political decisions with long-reaching consequences. But make no mistake: Science didn’t stop, and medicine has had its share of major advances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I have written for years, this is &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/11/03/why-were-not-prepared-for-next-wave-of-biotech-innovation/"&gt;biology’s century&lt;/a&gt; — a period of unprecedented advancement in medical science driven by an explosion of data, an unprecedented level of biological understanding, and a flood of private-sector money. What makes 2025 unique is that these advances, from an innovation in biotech that saved a baby with an ultra-rare disease to the arrival of a potent new weapon in the war on HIV, came against the backdrop of government decisions that will limit even the most promising science in the future. Here is a look at what 2025 brought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-gene-edit-and-a-baby"&gt;A gene edit and a baby&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ask anyone in biotech for the defining moment of medical innovation this year, and they’ll point you to KJ Muldoon. When he was just 6 months old, the genes of cells in KJ’s liver were &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/15/crispr-gene-editing-landmark-first-ever-single-patient-genetic-fix-nejm-reports/"&gt;edited using CRISPR&lt;/a&gt; — the technology that won researchers the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2020 — to correct a unique mutation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The treatment did not cure KJ, but it allowed him to resume a normal diet and means he is no longer facing the liver transplant that he likely would have needed otherwise. What was striking about the case was that KJ’s treatment had been developed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania on a one-off basis. The question now is whether — and how — the medical system can adapt to make more cases like this possible. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Regulators have &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/12/fda-roadmap-how-to-scale-baby-kj-custom-gene-editing-treatment/"&gt;moved to lower barriers&lt;/a&gt; for the development of these “n of 1” treatments, but there is no commercial model to encourage them. The only approved gene-editing treatment, for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, is used to treat a larger population and still has a list price of more than $2 million. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-strong-crop-of-new-medicines"&gt;A strong crop of new medicines&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has approved 44 brand new drugs this year, down six from a year ago but still a bumper crop — and more than twice as many as were approved in 2010, when the pharmaceutical industry saw itself facing an innovation crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most new medicines are incremental advances, but every year a few stand out for either their immediate impact or their potential. Here are some that meet those criteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeztugo&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Gilead’s long-acting medicine for the prevention of HIV infection is the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/18/fda-approves-gilead-hiv-prevention-drug-lenacapavir-yeztugo-next-best-thing-to-vaccine/"&gt;closest thing yet to a vaccine&lt;/a&gt; against the disease. The Trump administration’s dismantling of USAID and cuts to other HIV-prevention programs could blunt its impact, but deals Gilead has made with generics makers could still lead to broad distribution. An agreement with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria could provide the drug to 2 million people in resource-limited countries over three years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Journavx&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;A non-opioid painkiller developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/30/vertex-pain-drug-journavx-wins-fda-approval-non-opioid/"&gt;approved at the start of the year&lt;/a&gt;. There are questions about how effective it is, but if patients, doctors, hospitals, and insurers embrace it, Journavx could spare some people from being exposed to addictive treatments. It’s one to watch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New antibiotics: Two new antibiotics were approved to treat gonorrhea. Nuzolvence was produced by the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/17/zoliflodacin-gonorrhea-gardp-innoviva-antibiotic-resistance/"&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; of Innoviva Specialty Therapeutics and the Global Antibiotic Research &amp;amp; Development Partnership, and Blujepa by GSK. That’s important because even as bacteria have become more resistant to common antibiotics, antibiotic drug development has been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2025/05/07/antibiotics-antimicrobial-pharma-biotech-medicines/"&gt;stymied by scientific and commercial challenges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-progress-against-cancer"&gt;Progress against cancer&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is not a single drug that changes everything, but advances that add up one after another. Take lung cancer, for instance, for which the FDA in 2025 approved five new drugs targeting different subtypes of the disease. They are among a broader group of targeted medicines that have in recent years extended the lives of patients with metastatic disease.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Among new approvals, for instance, was one for the combination of Rybrevant and Lazcluze, from Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, which was shown to extend the time before tumors grow significantly in non-small cell lung cancer caused by a mutation in the gene EGFR. So did the targeted therapy Tagrisso, from AstraZeneca, when given with chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other advances register here, too. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/02/enhertu-breast-cancer-astrazeneca-daiichi-sankyo/"&gt;Enhertu&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/10/24/with-an-old-approach-but-new-energy-adcs-take-center-stage-as-promising-cancer-treatments/"&gt;antibody-drug conjugate&lt;/a&gt;, which combines a genetically targeted therapy with a chemotherapeutic warhead in a single molecule, became the new standard of care for patients’ whose tumors test positive for a protein called HER2 when added to an existing drug, Perjeta. Adding Enhertu delayed tumor progression by a median seven months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vaccines-delivering-more-for-less"&gt;Vaccines delivering more for less&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Being vaccinated against shingles is already important; it is, quite simply, a painful disease no one wants. But there is building evidence of another reason: The herpes zoster virus that causes shingles may also contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s. A study published using data in Wales, where there was a specific birthdate cut-off for getting a shingles vaccine, helped&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; back up this idea.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another example of a vaccine doing more than was intended: HPV vaccinations have &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/25/hpv-vaccine-prevent-cervical-cancer-cervarix-gardasil-study/"&gt;nearly eliminated cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt; in some countries, and can also prevent head and neck cancer. Emerging data say the vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/28/hpv-vaccine-single-dose-prevents-infection-just-as-well-as-two-doses-hci-clinical-trial/"&gt;may work well as one dose, instead of two&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not clear whether the U.S. will move in that direction, but the news could be a big deal in areas where vaccines are in short supply.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-glp-1-pills"&gt;The GLP-1 pills&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 agonists — weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — are changing society’s health and our culture. In December, a higher dose of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, was approved for weight loss (and the reduction of cardiovascular risks) &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/22/wegovy-pill-oral-weight-loss-treatment-approved/"&gt;as a pill instead of an injection&lt;/a&gt;. The drug was developed by Novo Nordisk. In some ways, it’s a small thing; Novo previously had a GLP-1 pill approved to treat type 2 diabetes. But another new such pill is coming soon from Eli Lilly, and the availability of these medicines will be one more way that they reshape the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-watch"&gt;What to watch&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was also some more futuristic progress afoot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new gene therapy &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/24/huntingtons-gene-therapy-uniqure/"&gt;showed promise in Huntington’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, although it seems to have &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/03/huntingtons-disease-fda-update-uniqure/"&gt;run into hurdles at the FDA&lt;/a&gt; and full data have not yet been presented.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have made significant progress in creating genetically engineered pigs whose organs can be transplanted into people, potentially alleviating the organ shortage. Work is moving forward with &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/08/pig-organ-transplant-egenesis-revivicor-human-trials-fda/"&gt;kidneys&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/25/first-lung-xenotransplant-gene-edited-pig/"&gt;gene-edited lung&lt;/a&gt; was transplanted into a brain-dead patient as a first step toward trials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest hurdles in biotechnology is that so much progress relies exclusively on companies. It was heartening, then, that an Italian nonprofit was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/10/nonprofit-telethon-wins-fda-approval-gene-therapy-waskyra/"&gt;able to bring a gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; to market successfully. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s hoping for more breakthroughs in 2026 — and smoother sailing for medical science writ large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

is that this mystery virus shouldn't keep you out for too long, although some symptoms can linger for up to two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Ian Budd, lead prescribing pharmacist at &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.chemist-4-u.com/cold-flu"&gt;Chemist4U&lt;/a&gt;, has explained what is most likely going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Adenovirus is a highly contagious flu-like virus (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"What we’re seeing in the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;, often called a ‘mystery virus’ or a fast-spreading throat/respiratory bug, lines up with what clinicians and public &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; bodies are seeing: adenovirus, a group of common respiratory viruses that circulate widely," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an adenovirus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/population-health/health-protection/infectious-diseases/adenovirus/overview/symptoms/"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; Public Health Scotland, adenoviruses 'can cause a wide range of illnesses such as common cold or flu-like symptoms'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Although human disease may often be mild or moderate, it can be severe especially when untreated in elderly or immunocompromised individuals," the health service notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While these viruses 'aren’t new', Budd says that 'more people are noticing symptoms and heading to their GP'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the difference between an adenovirus and a cold or flu?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Compared to a cold, adenovirus can be more likely to cause fever and conjunctivitis, and symptoms can last longer," Budd explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;It's currently spreading across the UK (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The difference with flu, however, is that there is currently no vaccine for adenovirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Due to the cold, more people are getting ill because they're spending more time indoors and are in closer proximity to people who might be carrying a bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Budd explained: "With COVID-19 restrictions lifted and fewer people catching other viruses over the past few years, immunity in the community may be lower, leading to people becoming more susceptible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Adenovirus isn’t a new virus;

She was recently named acting director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the fifth person to lead the center this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The acting appointment of Høeg could signify a closer partnership between the drug and vaccine centers as Høeg and Prasad consolidate power at the agency – and it signals a greater focus upon dismantling already-approved vaccines at the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg has frequently advocated for ending some childhood vaccine recommendations in the US in order to be more similar to Denmark, a nation with universal health coverage and a population roughly the size of Wisconsin’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So far in public appearances, she has continued to focus on vaccines – typically the purview of Prasad, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) – rather than drug regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg’s predecessors reportedly clashed with Prasad when he attempted to pull drug-regulatory employees into vaccine-regulation work, but Høeg and Prasad have worked together closely both at the FDA and by co-authoring research in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg has no apparent experience in drug development, regulation or management, which has been typical for past directors of the CBER. She has worked at the FDA as a senior adviser to the commissioner, Marty Makary, and CBER since March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She doesn’t seem to have any of the qualifications” for running the drug-regulation department, said Jonathan Howard, a neurologist and psychiatrist who has closely tracked Covid contrarians, including in his new book, Everyone Else Is Lying to You. “She’s never run a randomized controlled trial. She has no expertise leading a large organization. She has no expertise in industry regulation or drug approvals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Past directors of CBER would “understand laws and regulations and the science of drug development”, said Janet Woodcock, former acting FDA commissioner and former CBER director. “Objectively, she doesn’t have the kind of background that previous people who ran CBER have had.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The drug center has an enormous portfolio at FDA, Woodcock pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Everybody just pays attention to the new drug program, but the generic program approves thousands of generic drugs. There’s a biosimilars program, over-the-counter program and so forth, and all of those have to be looked after,” Woodcock said. “The thing you don’t keep your eye on, that’s the thing that I always told people is going to bite you in the behind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is also a significant leadership component to the position, which oversees more than 5,000 employees. “It’s a huge management job, if you do it right,” Woodcock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In response to the Guardian’s questions about Høeg’s qualifications and whether this appointment signifies greater collaboration among FDA leaders on vaccines, the “questions rely on incorrect assumptions”, said Emily Hilliard, press secretary for the Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This background aligns with the responsibilities of her role,” Hilliard said, pointing to the months Høeg spent advising the FDA commissioner on “drug safety and regulatory science, including computational safety modeling and vaccine surveillance”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As acting director, Høeg inherits the commissioner’s new priority voucher program, a controversial one-day drug-approval program that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/15/fda-us-healthcare" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/dec/03/fda-drug-chief-signals-retires-pazdur" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;troubled&lt;/a&gt; her predecessors, Richard Pazdur and George Tidmarsh. “How are these drugs being chosen for this voucher program? Who makes the decisions?” Howard said. “There’s a lot of secrecy going on at the FDA right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Overall, he said, “the FDA seems to be moving towards laxer regulations of all drugs, except for vaccines”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;With vaccines, Høeg has a more established, if troubling, track record, Howard said. She published a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13759" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; using unconfirmed crowd-sourced reports to determine the rate of heart inflammation after Covid vaccination. She advised the Florida surgeon general Joseph Ladapo, who reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/24/florida-surgeon-general-covid-vaccine-00093510" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;altered data&lt;/a&gt; to suggest Covid vaccines are more dangerous than they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Part of her “wish list” for the new Trump administration included changing regulations for new vaccines and ending “unnecessary” vaccines, she &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doctor-with-wish-list-more-vaccine-scrutiny-named-assistant-new-fda-chief-2025-04-02/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; after the election on a podcast with Christine Stabell Benn, one of the Danish researchers who recently received a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/19/hepatitis-b-vaccine-study-guinea-bissau-rfk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;controversial CDC grant&lt;/a&gt; to study hepatitis B vaccines in Guinea-Bissau. At the FDA, Høeg has reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/12/fda-vaccine-policy-controlled-by-vinay-prasad-tracy-beth-hoeg/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; excluding young men from getting Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She’s an all-around ideologue who starts off with her conclusions and works backwards to retrofit the evidence in a very disingenuous, dishonest way,” Howard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg joined other contrarians, like Marty Makary, Vinay Prasad and Jay Bhattacharya, in sharply criticizing the handling of the Covid pandemic, particularly vaccination; they’ve all been given high-profile positions in the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“They’re totally consolidating power, these Covid contrarians,” Howard said. “Everything that’s happening now is a direct consequence of rage and anger over Covid mitigations. These people are furious – livid that their genius wasn’t acknowledged. So they’re on kind of a revenge tour.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the pandemic, the contrarians were like “armchair quarterbacks”, Woodcock said. “The problem with that is, they think they can play the game. They can’t play the game. They’ve never played the game, they just criticized every play.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Raymond Pollak, an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) adviser and transplant surgeon, pointed out that “our patient population in the United States is very different culturally” from Høeg’s homeland of Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Denmark &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/19/denmark-vaccine-schedule-vs-us/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;does not&lt;/a&gt; routinely vaccinate against hepatitis B (at birth), chickenpox, influenza, rotavirus, hepatitis A, meningococcal disease or RSV. As a result, there are tens of thousands of vaccine-preventable diseases each year in Denmark, a nation of 6 million people – less than the population of New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There are other major differences as well. Prenatal care is free for all in Denmark, and the country has a national health registry. More than 95% of pregnant women in Denmark are screened for hepatitis B, and pregnant people who test positive – and their babies – are monitored to ensure that they are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In comparison, each year, 500,000 pregnant people in the US are never tested for hepatitis B, and many infants born to positive or status-unknown parents are lost to follow-up as soon as they leave the hospital, said Adam Langer, acting principal deputy director and associate director for science at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And the US has different disease patterns and risks compared with most other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The United States is a unique country. I think that most of us would agree that we don’t really have a peer nation in this world,” Langer said at an ACIP meeting earlier this month. The closest might be Canada, he said – and they are moving toward the same birth dose recommendations the US just jettisoned. “So let’s talk about apples to apples, not apples to oranges,” Langer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet Høeg cast doubt on the evidence behind hepatitis B vaccination, stating that “from a regulatory perspective” officials in the second Trump administration “have a very low level of confidence” in saying that these benefits of the vaccines outweigh the risks, while presenting no new evidence of risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg also featured several anti-vaccine talking points in her comments during a presentation she made on the Danish vaccination schedules to the ACIP. When discussing the number of vaccines a child receives in the US, Høeg questioned the amount of aluminum in each shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I do not feel like we have the data to show that there is an established safe amount that children can receive before the age of two, before the age of 18,” she said, and she also doubted the data on the effects of giving multiple vaccines concurrently. Aluminum adjuvants help vaccines work effectively and have been &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-074874/205757/The-Role-and-Safety-of-Aluminum-Adjuvants-in?autologincheck=redirected" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;shown to be safe&lt;/a&gt;, and it is safe to give multiple vaccines at once, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/multiples.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg also took aim at the RSV shots that have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/18/rsv-cases-decline-vaccines-treatment" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dramatically reduced&lt;/a&gt; hospitalization among US babies, claiming that in the trials there was a higher death rate, though she admitted it was “not quite statistically significant”. No such safety signals have been announced in the rollout of RSV shots over the past several years, but the FDA is still &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/rsv-shots-vaccines-rfk-hhs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;launching an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into their safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In December, 12 former commissioners of the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMp2517497" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;penned&lt;/a&gt; a warning in the New England Journal of Medicine about the lack of transparency in announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/fda-vaccine-regulations-unconfirmed-covid-deaths" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;new changes&lt;/a&gt; to vaccine regulations. In the past, regulatory officials were rigorous about documenting benefits and harms based on publicly available evidence, said Woodcock, one of the signatories to the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The commissioners are writing because that is not the process that has been followed, and it’s not generally a scientific process of open debate,” Woodcock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You can just make decisions because you have the pen and say: ‘It’s because I said so.’ But that doesn’t lead to, over time, a lot of trust in the system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxONVpzWG0xMi1JRUsySTJrTk5lUDRQZVlISTVQdXFrU2NZbUJuSGZGYU1pUUlzOFVmMDNSOHhzOUE2M09hdkNmdmd4N2pTZmNPdGJRcWNPdWVKaWlyWURiY2tMTHZ6bFhLOWItcFNBOUF1bkhDaDVVWjVGek9UQ0puZVln</guid></item><item><title>1月份由营养师制定的31天地中海饮食计划- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/31-day-mediterranean-diet-meal-plan-for-more-energy-in-january-11865930</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-table__table-wrapper"&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7527550/you-just-started-the-mediterranean-diet-here-are-the-recipes-to-make-first/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet recipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 368 to 584 calories while the lunches span 359 to 505 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re feeling sluggish, there may be several factors at play. Taking a look at your sleep habits, nutrition routine and hydration status are good first steps. Focusing on good &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7527638/how-to-sleep-better/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; hygiene and getting enough hours per night, eating regular meals with protein and fiber, getting enough physical activity and drinking plenty of water are all strategies to increase your energy. If you’re still feeling low energy, reach out to your medical provider as fatigue can be a symptom of many underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_787-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290484/why-the-mediterranean-diet-is-so-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; is routinely named one of the healthiest eating patterns.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It emphasizes a high intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, fish, nuts, seeds and whole grains while limiting refined grains and added sugars. Though it was initially named after the eating patterns observed by some of the countries that border the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/longform/8046714/a-new-mediterranean-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt;, it’s important to note that this is a vast region consisting of a variety of cuisines and cultures. With its emphasis on eating more produce and healthy fats as well as cooking more meals at home and limiting processed foods, this healthy eating pattern is adaptable to a wide array of cuisines. With its emphasis on cooking more meals at home and eating plenty of produce, fiber-rich legumes, whole grains and healthy fats, it’s no surprise that this eating style has numerous health benefits. Research links the Mediterranean diet to lower rates of obesity, improved heart health and a reduced risk of chronic disease.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Though the Mediterranean diet limits added sugars and refined grains, it’s not restrictive, meaning it’s more likely to be adapted as a lifestyle change than a short-term diet. &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;To follow the Mediterranean diet, focus on foods you could be adding to your routine instead of trying to avoid certain foods. Aim to include more vegetables, fruits, fish, nuts, legumes, whole grains and legumes into your meals to reap the benefits. No restrictive resolutions here!

Scientific research has repeatedly shown that the simple, ancient human habit of taking step after step can help you lose weight, raise your metabolism, strengthen your heart and lungs, and galvanise your bones, joints and muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can help to prevent dementia, Type 2 diabetes, some cancers and heart disease. And it’s available to all: according to Harvard researchers, it can even counteract weight gain in people born with weight-promoting genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking has been shown to boost mood, reduce anxiety and enhance sleep. It can even cut cravings for sugary foods, reduce your number of sick days and boost your creative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), believes walking is “the closest thing we have to a wonder drug”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the benefits of walking stem from the physical motion involved, which burns calories, lubricates joints and muscles, boosts blood flow and fortifies bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other rewards are derived from the mental freedom and perspective it yields. Further health gains originate from the simple act of injecting more movement and mobility into your day. But, together, the results are astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why global health bodies universally encourage us to start ambling, strolling, plodding, hiking, trekking or rambling over pavements, grass, mud or beaches, through forests or fields or on whirring treadmills – however, wherever and whenever we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where does the 10,000 steps goal come from?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/12/10000-steps-2.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-953007"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The 10,000 steps a day target has its origins in the run-up to the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the specific health goal of 10,000 steps a day has become baked into the public consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is some science to back up the figure. Studies published by the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/em&gt; found that walking 10,000 steps a day is linked to a lower risk of heart disease, cancer and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2016 research paper found walking 10,000 steps per day can lower body fat percentage, reduce anxiety, depression and fatigue, and boost mood after only 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a far more nuanced picture is now emerging. While 10,000 steps a day is a healthy target to aim for, it seems this figure is somewhat arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might guess from the catchy number, it originated as a marketing slogan. In the run-up to the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, the Yamasa Corporation, which manufactured industrial instruments and special watches, came up with an early-generation wearable pedometer called a Manpo-Kei, which translates as the “10,000 steps meter”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where this step target came from, nobody knows. Some have suggested it may have been chosen because the Japanese character for 10,000 looks like a man running or walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the 10,000 steps target appears to be an educated, albeit arbitrary figure to aim for, later research by Dr Yoshiro Hatano, an academic at Kyushu University of Health and Welfare, found 10,000 steps a day was indeed a good target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He found that people who took 10,000 steps could achieve a sustainable calorie burn of 300 calories per day, which research had suggested offered a protective effect against heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t until the huge boom in wearable technology in the 2000s that the figure spread around the world, with the World Health Organisation and other health bodies adopting the 10,000 steps goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure is so ingrained into our health consciousness it is usually the default setting in wearable fitness trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is some reasonable science to back up this target, most studies are based on a rather simplistic comparison between people who take 10,000 steps a day and those who reach far lower numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, people who take 10,000 steps tend to be fitter and healthier. But in recent years, researchers have taken a more forensic approach to the issue, and the results have been revealing. Here are the five key findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;7,500 steps is the sweet spot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research by Harvard Medical School has revealed that, even though mortality rates improve with the more daily steps you take, the benefits level off after around 7,500 steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any more, such as the magical 10,000 figure, will burn more calories and keep you fit. But 7,500 steps is enough if you want to live longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even taking 4,400 daily steps is associated with a huge 41% reduction in mortality. But you can reap the most benefits from 7,500 steps a day – 25% fewer than the 10,000-step target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is still no universally agreed figure in the research community. A major global study, by the Medical University of Lodz and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, which analysed 226,000 people, showed 4,000 steps is enough to reduce the risk of dying prematurely, while just over 2,300 steps is enough to start benefitting the heart and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the more steps you take, the more you gain. Every 1,000 daily steps beyond 4,000 reduces your risk of dying early by 15%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;, involving 111,000 people, found the health benefits begin at around 2,600 steps per day, but they plateau at around 8,800 steps per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while there is no hard number to aim for, the evidence now suggests 7,500-8,800 steps per day is a more solid marker to target. Taking at least 2,300 steps will still help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And 10,000 or above is still potent if you enjoy walking or want to &lt;a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/nutrition/how-to-lose-weight-cycling"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;. But you can enjoy a beautiful spectrum of health benefits from the 7,500-8,800 mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Walk faster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/12/10000-steps-3-1.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-953012"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Adding speed and purpose to your walking is better for long-term health. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has injected an interesting new dimension into the steps debate. It seems the pace of your walks is also an important factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brisk, purposeful 4mph seems best. A huge study of 475,000 people by the University of Leicester found that women who walk briskly, at over 4mph, enjoy a life-expectancy boost of up to 15 years over those who move at less than 3mph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For men, the life expectancy boost was even higher – around 20 years. Experts don’t know if this is because walking faster is better for the heart and lungs, or if it is just a general reflection of existing good health. But picking up the pace on your daily walks seems to offer a powerful health upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Move more during the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting a certain number of steps per day is a good idea, because quantifying exercise boosts your motivation and commitment. But when and how you take those steps is important, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that to counter the impact of a sedentary modern lifestyle, it is vital to achieve more movement throughout the day. Most of us spend 50-70% of our time sitting down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long periods of sitting are associated with a 90% increase in the risk of death from &lt;a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/health/how-to-navigate-heart-condition-diagnosis"&gt;heart problems&lt;/a&gt; and a 49% increase in the overall risk of dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But staying active throughout the day helps to counter those risks. Research suggests that even regular strolls – around the office or in the park at lunchtime – can protect against the harmful effects of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study showed that short 10-minute walks reverse the vascular dysfunction – such as reduced blood flow and increased stress on the artery walls – caused by sedentary jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A global team of scientists found that doing only three minutes of moderate exercise for each hour of the day you spend sitting down can cut your chance of an early death by 30%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, adding these micro-bursts of movement during the working day can help to counter the effects of a sedentary lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Add in some HIIT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking offers a spectacular all-round health boost, but there are some things other forms of exercise are better for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to raise your heart rate in order to further strengthen your cardiovascular system and lung performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you choose runs, bike rides or fitness classes, the best intensity to aim for is 85-95% of your maximum heart rate – enough to make you feel out of breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major review in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/em&gt; found &lt;a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/hiit-interval-training"&gt;high-intensity interval training&lt;/a&gt; – short bursts of 30-second or 1-minute efforts at 85-95% of your maximum heart rate – significantly improve maximal oxygen uptake, diastolic blood pressure, blood sugar levels, waist circumference, body fat percentage, resting heart rate and systolic blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, enjoy your walks, but make sure you add in two or three harder workouts per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Lift weights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/12/10000-steps-4.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-953010"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Adding high intensity to your activities raises your heart rate and boosts health in so many ways. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to your walks, it is important to do resistance training. Lean muscle mass deteriorates with age (a process known as sarcopenia). However, &lt;a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/strength-training-cycling"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; – whether lifting dumbbells or completing bodyweight drills – has been shown to improve muscle mass, burn abdominal fat, boost metabolism, enhance balance and mobility, reduce inflammation and improve bone health – all vital supplements to your daily walking regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study by Penn State College of Medicine found adults who do strength training twice a week have a 46% lower risk of death from any cause. And a study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Bone and Mineral Research &lt;/em&gt;found that two resistance training sessions per week is enough to protect your bone density and muscle mass as you age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking truly is a magical elixir for good health. And it should be the foundation stone of any healthy lifestyle. But whatever daily steps target you aim for, don’t forget to take a few extra steps to protect your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BikeRadar</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1nOTlicnJDVHJUbG9iUGtCdE85RF9hSV9Ld2pwdW9kT2VpXy1IMWxyRWhwSWhXZUpTTFVZcndkei03a3ZmcUZXVFBiT2NQNEpCSEZWZ2h2OG9lZWI0WHR3TU9nS0tHQjNUQXpmUW1fUjZrZw</guid></item><item><title>随着流感病例的增加，家庭流感检测的注意事项- ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/amid-rise-flu-cases-home-flu-tests/story?id=128779487</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;As &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://goodmorningamerica.com/news/story/flu-activity-rises-sharply-us-75-million-illnesses-128765018" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;flu season&lt;/a&gt; continues to rise across the United States this holiday season, it may be worth considering an at-home test for the seasonal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The flu season this year is earlier and stronger than last year," &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/video/128778220" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;ABC News medical correspondent Dr. Darien Sutton said Tuesday on "Good Morning America&lt;/a&gt;."

Experts believe that the flu vaccine will still help reduce the risk of severe illness, including hospitalization and death and emphasize it’s not too late to get this season’s shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Where to buy at-home flu tests?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;At-home flu tests can be bought at pharmacies nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Walgreens, Target, CVS and Walmart are among several retailers that sell tests as flu cases continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Amazon Prime also lists multiple different brands of at-home flu tests in stock for home delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;How much do at-home flu tests cost?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The prices for at-home flu tests vary depending on the brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;While prices vary, Walgreens, CVS and Target list options in the range of $20 to $30 range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Many options come with multiple tests per package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;How do some at-home flu tests work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The at-home flu tests generally work as nasal swabs, allowing users to self-swab their own nostrils while testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"These tests can be really helpful," said Sutton.

Therefore, the CDC says treatment should not be withheld due to a negative test result if a person’s symptoms are consistent with the flu, especially if they are at high risk of severe illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;Any person who tests positive for the flu should minimize contact with others until they are feeling better. To reduce the risk of spreading respiratory viruses, it’s recommended to practice good hand washing, frequently disinfect or sanitize surfaces that are frequently touched, and consider wearing a mask to reduce the risk of spreading a virus to others when you cannot isolate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 13:24:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNMTJpVlVEZXNPVUl1SUdKTHMyWXQzRzFvekNwVzlack53Q0Q2U3B2VEJ5LWV1UnlNTWVEWXZtZ0pjSjdic1VodE9VVm9YbnNUbXA0WXRxQkFLWXY0a3BkanVsTXQ2b1ZVR3paNWhWTF9XOE9jT1lsRmRfVERyS0JKUUFHc3dBRUh2QnpoSm5lTjJxdkXSAZgBQVVfeXFMTUpIaV81dnBtNDJ2N2FqZUR5amdDWGNWbkhENHJQSjlxZThxTk5fVVh2VEljWHh4TWJlb2tfbVdodGFUVmZBNWZrOWZFWU1kdE5CdlBpMGZ3SGowSFBWQWRMZFUzZUhTazlHX2JFZFJoZTNJYVRVLUxocDZSOVRvZVJXUlUwSTZtdmg4MVl1QS1WY0o5SFU3VWg</guid></item></channel></rss>
