But more research has shown that, actually, for most people, the cholesterol in eggs &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/wellness-us/nutrition/article-13101983/foods-high-fat-cholesterol-heart-health.html"&gt;has little effect on blood&lt;/a&gt; cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, factors like saturated and trans fats in the diet play a more significant role in heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shrimp and pork, Dr Levine added, are healthy &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14496553/I-admitted-hospital-eating-protein-weeks-reason-make-you-never-want-eat-steak-again.html"&gt;protein alternatives to red meat&lt;/a&gt; despite doctors’ warnings about their cholesterol and saturated fat contents, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And avocados similarly slammed for being high in fat, are full of healthy monosaturated fat that can lower LDL cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Coffee, maligned by some in the medical community for years due to caffeine’s ability to increase a person’s blood pressure and heart rate temporarily, posing a risk for someone with pre-existing high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But actually,’ Dr Levine &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drevanlevine/video/7460663938993212703"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, ‘all have been found not to be true.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cardiologists have long warned against cholesterol-rich and saturated fat foods but may have targeted the wrong ones. Dr Evan Levine of Mt Sinai Hospital highlighted five foods once discouraged for heart health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Coffee has long been criticized for temporarily raising blood pressure and heart rate, but research shows no significant link between coffee consumption and long-term hypertension risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shifts in thinking about foods – which are harmful and which are good – are due to evolving research surrounding fats and fat intake, particularly saturated fats, the growing emphasis on whole foods, understanding of the impact of ultra-processed foods, and the rise in more personalized diet and nutrition plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further, scientists have since collected decades-long study findings about the complex relationship between nutrition and heart disease, along with a laundry list of other health problems affecting every organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have vacillated more on coffee than on any other beverage over the past six decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Evidence pointing to its benefits and risks continues to pile up, causing people to wonder whether their daily cup could be putting their heart at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The caffeine in coffee has been found to have a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24203773/#:~:text=Though%20caffeine%20drinkers%20may%20exhibit,the%20BP%20effects%20of%20caffeine."&gt;minimal effect&lt;/a&gt; on blood pressure. In 2022, researchers in Korea reviewed 13 long-term studies with nearly 315,000 people and found no significant connection between coffee intake and &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jkms.org/pdf/10.3346/jkms.2022.37.e332?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;high blood pressure risk&lt;/a&gt; overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine said: ‘Even the American Heart Association says it’s heart healthy. Just don’t add sugar and cream.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A black cup of coffee contains just a few calories and none of the added fat from cream or whole milk. Dairy, especially full-fat dairy, contains high amounts of saturated fat known to raise LDL cholesterol in the blood, which is linked to both heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For this reason, Dr Levine recommends holding the butter and the salt when making your morning eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nutrition science has changed in recent years as more experts and scientists acknowledge that blood cholesterol levels are mostly determined by the amount of fats and carbohydrates in the diet, not by dietary cholesterol such as that found in eggs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eggs cooked in olive or avocado oil are ‘loaded with nutrients, unsaturated fatty acids, and can actually increase your HDL [good] cholesterol.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cholesterol in the yolks, he added, has little to no impact on the cholesterol in the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘That was the fear for years,’ he said. ‘But guess what… It’s the stupid saturated fat that your liver takes up and makes cholesterol that causes your cholesterol to go up. Eating cholesterol may even reduce your liver from making it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cholesterol worries have also kept doctors from endorsing shellfish, especially shrimp, for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While high in cholesterol, shellfish like shrimp, lobster, and crab do not have the same impact on blood cholesterol levels as foods high in saturated fats, like red meat or processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For most people, dietary cholesterol—such as that found in seafood and eggs — has a minimal effect on raising blood cholesterol compared to the amount of saturated and trans fats in their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pork is another healthy protein source often outshined by chicken. Leaner cuts like pork tenderloin and loin chops are relatively low in fat and can be part of a heart-healthy diet when consumed a few times per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating a pork tenderloin is nothing like eating bacon or sausage, which are processed with preservatives and sky-high amounts of added sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eating just one avocado a week cut the risk of heart disease by up to a fifth in a study of more than 100,000 people (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And unlike beef, which has a slightly higher saturated fat content, unprocessed pork is a healthy low-fat protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avocado has also been maligned for its fat content, ‘but it contains lots of dietary fiber and what kind of fat? Unsaturated fats, especially the real healthy stuff, the monosaturated fats.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study published in 2022 in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.121.024014#:~:text=Clinical%20Perspective&amp;amp;text=In%202%20large%20US%20cohorts,disease%20and%20coronary%20heart%20disease."&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; followed more than 110,000 people for 30 years and found that eating at least one whole avocado each week reduced heart disease risk by 16 percent compared to those who did not eat any avocado.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of coronary heart disease, a condition caused by the narrowing of arteries due to plaque build-up, was 21 percent lower in those who ate at least one avocado weekly than those who ate none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine said: ‘Replacing animal products like butter, cheese, or bacon with avocado – makes sense – is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘On top of an egg, on top of anything, a salad, a piece of chicken or pork, sounds good to me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 14:53:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Are you cleaning your water bottle enough? - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxOZzZod0NHSWd0QUowOTZJOWV4XzctUldWY2RubjNqSjlQckZhTFNCdGltLVlxbmpkY3RBb1hCcUc0Q0x0SkJBSmJxeXZPZ1A1b2gteU1STHdNX25MWFJOOTZoU05BNmZicmswVlk3TU5RbTdkNUJhMGpBR0R1QktKLUR3UTZFQy1CcWFsUmQxbTRiczdzOENNYm1Yamx1WFg5cHFzcEVGZURiQmw5SzZuR04tOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Are you cleaning your water bottle enough?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 EXUng"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kypj47.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kypj47.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kypj47.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kypj47.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kypj47.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kypj47.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kypj47.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kypj47.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kypj47.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kypj47.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Gorka Olmo Illustration of a bottle with people wearing protective suits cleaning the inside with the cap of the bottle to the right (Credit: Gorka Olmo)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Gorka Olmo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;b id="every-time-you-take-a-sip-from-your-water-bottle,-you-are-depositing-bacteria-inside-and-over-the-course-of-a-day-these-can-multiply-by-the-millions.-here's-what-scientists-say-you-can-do-about-it." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Every time you take a sip from your water bottle, you are depositing bacteria inside and over the course of a day these can multiply by the millions.

"I realised that the slippery sensation I felt in the interior of the bottle was not because of the material but rather because of a bacterial build-up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His next step was to design a study. Behnke and colleagues &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.foodprotection.org/members/fpt-archive-articles/2017-11-the-cleanliness-of-reusable-water-bottles-how-contamination-levels-are-affected-by-bottle-us/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;stopped passers-by in a corridor&lt;/a&gt; at Purdue and asked if they would be happy to loan their water bottles to them as part of their research – to see how clean they were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"One thing that stood out from the project was the number of people who didn't want to know the results," recalls Behnke. "Basically, they knew that their cleaning habits were poor to non-existent – something the data later confirmed." The results &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.foodprotection.org/members/fpt-archive-articles/2017-11-the-cleanliness-of-reusable-water-bottles-how-contamination-levels-are-affected-by-bottle-us/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;confirmed that those bottles were brimming with bacteria.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But while they help people to stay hydrated, drinking from water bottles regularly, and taking them with us everywhere we go, may also pose health risks. So, should we ditch them, or can those risks be managed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="what-exactly-is-inside-reusable-water-bottles?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="what-exactly-is-inside-reusable-water-bottles?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;What exactly is inside reusable water bottles?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While it's usually safe to drink, water from our kitchen taps is not devoid of microbial life. This is why leaving water in your bottle for a few days will encourage bacteria to grow, says Primrose Freestone, associate professor in clinical microbiology at the University of Leicester, in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Bacteria that can cause human infections thrives at around 37C (98F) Freestone says, but it can also multiply at room temperature, around 20C (68F).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The longer water in a bottle is stored at room temperature, the more bacteria will grow," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One study conducted in Singapore using boiled tap water – which should have killed most bacteria in it – found that bacteria populations can grow rapidly inside water bottles as they are used throughout an average day. On average they found that reusable bottles used by adults went from around 75,000 bacteria per millilitre in mid-morning to more &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.civilenvironjournal.com/fulltext/acee/pdf/acee-aid1007.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;1-2 million per millilitre&lt;/a&gt; over the course of 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Gorka Olmo Every sip you take from a water bottle or even a glass can leave microbes behind that mingle with those already in the liquid (Credit: Gorka Olmo)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Gorka Olmo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Every sip you take from a water bottle or even a glass can leave microbes behind that mingle with those already in the liquid (Credit: Gorka Olmo)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One way to slow bacterial growth down is to store your bottle in the fridge between sips, Freestone says, though this doesn't stop it from growing altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But while some of a water bottle's bacterial activity comes from the water itself, most contamination is actually introduced by the drinker. Whether you take your bottle to work, the gym, or even just keep it in the house, the outside of your bottle will carry many microbes. And these microbes are easily transferred into the contents of the bottle, along with bacteria from your mouth every time you take a sip, Freestone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Water bottle users who don't wash their hands regularly will also find that their bottles can harbour bacteria such as &lt;i id="e.-coli" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, Freestone says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Poo-associated bacteria, such as &lt;i id="e.-coli" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, can come from our hands and end up on our lips if we're not good at toilet hygiene," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People generally have between 500 and 600 different species of bacteria living in their mouths says Freestone. "What isn't necessarily disease-causing for you isn't always the case for others. You can carry an infection and not realise it, because our immune systems are so good at protecting us," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Another way you can encourage bacterial growth in your bottle is by putting anything other than fresh water in them. Drinks that nourish you also feed microbes – so any drinks containing sugar, for example, can stimulate the growth of any bacteria or mould present in your bottle, Freestone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Anything other than water is heaven for bacteria and fungi, especially protein shakes," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;If you've ever left milk in a glass for a few hours, you may have noticed that it leaves behind a thin film on the glass when you pour it away.

It is only when the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro818" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;bacteria turn pathogenic&lt;/a&gt; – in other words they pick up certain traits that make them harmful – that they make people ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;Behnke and his colleagues also suggest using a dishwasher with a sanitisation cycle could be the most effective approach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Our guts are changing all the time, but there are over 1,000 species present in the gut so it's hard to shift in terms of composition," says Freestone. "There are too many variables to say, but getting food poisoning from the bacteria in a water bottle will never lead to a positive change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People who've recently taken antibiotics that can affect their gut microbiome can also experience changes that leave them more vulnerable to other infections. One swab of a reusable water bottle taken at a newspaper office in the UK also revealed that these bottles can be a breeding ground for emerging strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Researchers &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mbo3.1023" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;discovered a bacterium called &lt;i id="klebsiella-grimontii" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Klebsiella grimontii&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;– which is capable of forming biofilms on otherwise sterile surface –in the sample taken from the water bottle. While it can be found as part of the normal microflora of the gastrointestinal tract, it can also cause severe diarrhoea in people who have recently taken antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It's worth noting, however, there are no examples of severe illness that have been traced back to reusable water bottles in the scientific literature. This doesn't mean they don't happen, of course, as identifying &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/205/11/1639/844906?redirectedFrom=fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;single point sources&lt;/a&gt; of infection is notoriously difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="how-should-we-clean-reusable-bottles?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="how-should-we-clean-reusable-bottles?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;How should we clean reusable bottles?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For Behnke, it was the creeping sense that he should perhaps be cleaning his own water bottle more thoroughly that made him look closer at what could be inside it. He'd been using a filtered water bottle and had started to notice that the water he was drinking from it tasted bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Every now and then I would flush it with hot water, but never really did anything more than that," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;After his paper towel-based investigations revealed how manky his water bottle was, the study he and colleagues carried out went on to look at people's water bottle habits in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Behnke found that just over half of the 90 participants surveyed during the research said they share their bottle with others, and 15% said they never cleaned their bottles. Unsurprisingly, whether or not people rinsed or washed their water bottles affected the contamination level. However, Behnke found that how often they cleaned the bottles, or how they cleaned them, didn't enormously affect how contaminated the containers were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People who washed their bottle with tools such as a brush or used a dishwasher tended to have the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.foodprotection.org/members/fpt-archive-articles/2017-11-the-cleanliness-of-reusable-water-bottles-how-contamination-levels-are-affected-by-bottle-us/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;lowest counts of bacteria inside&lt;/a&gt;.

The most hygienic bottles are simply those that are the easiest to clean, Freestone says.

Two other studies, one by &lt;small&gt;GSK&lt;/small&gt;, a pharmaceutical company, and another by a group of academics in Britain, also reported that a newer “recombinant” vaccine, which is more effective at preventing shingles than the live version, appeared to confer even greater protection against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economist</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:56:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPbUZqMnVaczFSaFhMN1hvY20xMXFPT2VwOEhxaU0tZWpWM2sza1pfTGpOcEpoS0RwU0ozZ3lWR3FyOXBhb3dRaEQ4d2diTHlIWXRJQU94R1hBWVpQeVlZV3NyVDA3MFZ1bXZDV0c5ZnhFLTBFVHJFbU5WQlBHUVZaVFhsSkt5QXBCb3NPQ2o2ZHozbEE</guid></item><item><title>US reports first outbreak of deadly H7N9 bird flu since 2017 - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1AFBVV95cUxNMC15LVQ5cy01VTN2WGU4Wm1rdmprdm9xdE5XcnV0bk1OUVhQcHYwb1NlZEgwUmZsRV9ZQzBUSkk5YzlIRkZnTFl1dW02TnRVdWRmdkxGSlFfS19NVkNLc2xUemRnbFVqYldPakxOYURDeVJUTnBZLV9UMEdiTDkwSndaNHhzdndtM3pXWWh2X0VUV0VOM1lfc0d0VXQ5dnRSNXM3Sy14SFI4V2R1eGRDZmoyRWppWk9oSFJXLVMtSHVwQ3dTYnZPZkNhaXBJX25xRVJ1aQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:04:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxNMC15LVQ5cy01VTN2WGU4Wm1rdmprdm9xdE5XcnV0bk1OUVhQcHYwb1NlZEgwUmZsRV9ZQzBUSkk5YzlIRkZnTFl1dW02TnRVdWRmdkxGSlFfS19NVkNLc2xUemRnbFVqYldPakxOYURDeVJUTnBZLV9UMEdiTDkwSndaNHhzdndtM3pXWWh2X0VUV0VOM1lfc0d0VXQ5dnRSNXM3Sy14SFI4V2R1eGRDZmoyRWppWk9oSFJXLVMtSHVwQ3dTYnZPZkNhaXBJX25xRVJ1aQ</guid></item><item><title>WA schools see widespread declines in kindergartners vaccinated against measles - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxOY09lNlVPSWUycWhQYUVhb1VrdGIxd3pFemxmMG9FMnNkcWhFbTBYUzMtdkgybTJub1prVjNJR3JhLUtDWUY0cXRuTEZ5VDlrRWcxaENRU2tFeUhoczhUdUhsS0ZuY2lHUHVKbm1Dc2I1TjNoaHItZU9KZmVvSVA0Z3ZWd0UwVHNJMUt0MVZVYmgzT2Vpb2cxdlRZQ3p3VTRCeFJVOVVrQmJXZU8zRWZV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-content" class="article-content entry-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Measles outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico have led to &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/measles-cases-are-still-rising-in-texas-heres-what-you-should-know-about-the-contagious-virus/" class="content-link"&gt;nearly 300 cases&lt;/a&gt; and two deaths, raising public health concerns. Isolated cases have also been reported in a number of states, including Washington. Public Health — Seattle &amp;amp; King County last month &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/king-county-confirms-measles-case-public-warned-of-possible-exposure/" class="content-link"&gt;confirmed a case of measles in an infant&lt;/a&gt; who had traveled abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases come as public health experts have been increasingly concerned with falling childhood vaccination rates in the past several years, and of a growing anti-vaccination movement in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from the Washington State Department of Health shows that in 36 of the state’s 39 counties, the rate of vaccination against measles among kindergarten students fell from the 2019-20 to the 2023-24 school years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindergartners are required to be fully vaccinated against measles through the MMR vaccine before school begins, though &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/community-and-environment/schools/immunization" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;state law&lt;/a&gt; allows parents or guardians to claim exemptions for religious or medical reasons. The kindergarten vaccination rate has declined across Washington, and quite sharply in some counties. And in the 2023-24 school year, kindergartners in only one Washington county met the herd-immunity threshold for measles of a 95% vaccination rate. Herd immunity occurs when the rate of vaccinations is high enough to stop an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="graphics-gallery-embed-1815355635" class="graphics-gallery-container mv-4 u-border-b u-border-t u-border-light-gray pv-3 column-width-embed graphics-gallery__captions-disabled"&gt;
      &lt;p class="graphics-gallery__headline h3 u-sans u-bold mh-auto"&gt;Measles vaccination rates down across WA&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="graphics-gallery__subhead u-sans mb-2 mh-auto"&gt;In 36 of Washington’s 39 counties, the rate of kindergartners vaccinated for measles declined from the 2019-20 to the 2023-24 school year.&lt;/p&gt;
      


      
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious virus, and it doesn’t take much for the spread of the disease to spiral out of control. Fortunately, the measles vaccine is effective at preventing disease, and it also provides long-lasting immunity. The vaccine is given in two shots, the first when the child is 12-15 months old, and the second at 4-6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King was among the counties where the measles vaccination rate dropped. In the 2023-24 school year, the most recent data available, around 20,500 of the 22,200 kindergartners had received both doses of the measles vaccine, for a rate of 92.2%. That figure has gradually declined since the 2019-20 school year, when it was above the herd-immunity threshold, at 95.6%. King County fell below the 95% mark in the 2021-2022 school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the more than 1,700 kindergartners in King County listed as not vaccinated against measles in the previous school year, the majority (64%) were out of compliance, meaning they hadn’t submitted proof of vaccination and hadn’t received an exemption. While 30% had received religious exemptions or religious membership exemptions and 2% had medical exemptions. Around 4% had conditional status, meaning they intended to complete the vaccination requirement but had not done so yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the school districts wholly in King County, Enumclaw had the lowest rate of kindergarten measles vaccine completions in the 2023-24 school year, at 83.9%. Vashon Island, which has &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/vashons-parents-try-to-get-along-despite-deep-vaccination-divide/" class="content-link"&gt;long been known&lt;/a&gt; for its low rate of vaccinations, was second lowest, 84.3%, followed by Tukwila at 86.3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mercer Island School District had the highest rate of kindergarten measles vaccinations in the past school year, at 97.3%, followed by Shoreline at 97.2% and Lake Washington at 96.9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle Public Schools was below the 95% herd-immunity threshold at 93.1%. Seattle fell below the 95% mark in the 2021-22 school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles vaccination rates have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;fallen sharply&lt;/a&gt; in nearly every state since 2020. The decline has been linked to fallout from the pandemic, such as health concerns surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine and a decline in trust of public-health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest decline in kindergarten measles vaccinations among Washington counties was in rural Pend Oreille, in the northeast corner of the state, where the rate fell from 95.1% to 80% — a remarkable 15.1 percentage-point drop. Other large declines were in Pacific County, down 14 points, and Columbia County, down 12.9 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just two counties increased their rate of measles vaccine completions among kindergarten students from 2019-20 to 2023-24. Ferry County, in northeastern Washington, had the biggest jump, up 2.2 points. Even so, it still only had an 86.7% measles vaccination rate in the past school year. San Juan County had a small increase of less than one point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data wasn’t available for the 2019-20 school year for Wahkiakum County. According to the Department of Health, of the two schools in the county, one failed to report immunization numbers that year, and the other reported numbers with inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yakima County had the highest rate of kindergarten measles vaccinations in the 2023-24 school year, at 96.4%. It was, in fact, the only county where the rate exceeded the 95% herd-immunity threshold. That’s a big change from the 2019-20 school year, when 14 counties were above 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stevens County, in northeastern Washington, had the lowest rate of measles vaccinations among kindergartners, at 76.9%, and was one of two counties where the rate was below 80%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other was Jefferson County, where Port Townsend is located, with a rate of 79.2% in the last school year.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                Most kids recover from measles. But the virus can be deadly and can erase the immune system's memory.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico is now close to 300 reported cases, surpassing the total number of cases in all of the U.S. in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The outbreak&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/07/nx-s1-5312107/how-a-measles-outbreak-overwhelmed-a-small-west-texas-town" target="_blank"&gt; is happening in remote, rural areas&lt;/a&gt;. There have been a few isolated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;cases reported in 13 other states &lt;/a&gt; — not related to the Texas outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the nationwide risk remains low and that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination is the key to prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, doctors say it's a good time to remember how dangerous and long-lasting the health consequences of measles can be.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;a href="https://www2.phs.org/providers/alexandria-cvijanovich/2070089" target="_blank"&gt;Alex Cvijanovich&lt;/a&gt; has been a practicing pediatrician for more than 20 years. She says she's still haunted by the memory of a teenage boy she treated at the start of her career in Utah.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The boy had contracted measles as a 7-month-old, when he was too young to be vaccinated. "He got the virus from a child in his neighborhood who was unvaccinated," says Cvijanovich, who now practices in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was a relatively mild case of measles, and the infant recovered. She says he grew up to be a healthy, bright kid — an honor student.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then in middle school, he started to develop troubling symptoms. "He started getting lost between classes, lost like he couldn't find what class to go to next," Cvijanovich says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Worried, the teen's parents took him to a series of doctors to figure out what was wrong, until a pediatric neurologist finally suspected a condition called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560673/" target="_blank"&gt;subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, or SSPE&lt;/a&gt;. It's a degenerative neurological condition that typically develops seven to 10 years after a measles infection. It is almost always fatal. Cvijanovich was part of the hospital team that confirmed the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The problem is that there is no treatment for it," she says. "And he basically became more and more incapacitated over time."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some 18 months after his initial diagnosis, she says, the teenager died.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;SSPE was once considered quite rare. But Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City who wrote&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5292478/measles-vaccination-kids-health-disease" target="_blank"&gt; a history of measles,&lt;/a&gt; says data from outbreaks in the U.S. over the past several decades suggests that may not always be the case.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It turns out that in some age groups, especially in kids under about age 2, it's much more common than we thought," Ratner says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, a review of &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/2/226/3106340" target="_blank"&gt;measles cases in California&lt;/a&gt; found that, between 1988 and 1991, SSPE cases occurred as frequently as 1 in every 1,367 cases in unvaccinated children under age 5.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Another study that looked at U.S. outbreaks between 1989 and 1991 put the rate of SSPE at roughly &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16235165/" target="_blank"&gt;1 out of every 4,600 &lt;/a&gt;measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccination prevents not just SSPE, but also other serious complications that measles can cause — including pneumonia and severe brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And there's a common consequence from measles infection you might not know of: It can erase your immune memory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Not only does your brain have a memory, but your immune system has a memory of all the pathogens it's encountered in the past," says &lt;a href="https://genetics.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/stephen-j-elledge" target="_blank"&gt;Stephen Elledge&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the genetics department at Harvard Medical School who studies how the immune system responds to pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Elledge says your immune system holds on to those memories, so the next time it encounters a virus, it knows how to fight it. But measles can destroy the cells that retain those memories.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"And when you lose that memory, then you're no longer immune to that particular pathogen," he says. "So the next time you get it, you've got to fight that battle all over again."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This effect is called immune amnesia. Elledge says it happens to some extent with every measles infection, though its severity varies widely. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So whenever you get measles, you lose some of your immune memory. And the more severe your case of measles is, the longer it lasts, the more of your immune system is destroyed."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/10/31/775081827/measles-virus-may-wipe-out-immune-protection-for-other-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, Elledge and his colleagues found that unvaccinated children had lost between 11% and 73% of their antibodies, which recognize and neutralize viruses and bacteria.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Other research suggests it can take &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa3662" target="_blank"&gt;two to three years&lt;/a&gt; for the immune system to recover. And in the meantime, kids might be left vulnerable to infection from other diseases, including ones they had previously been immune to.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Researchers say immune amnesia helps explain one phenomenon that was documented after the introduction of the measles vaccine in the 1960s: Deaths from other childhood diseases &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/05/07/404963436/scientists-crack-a-50-year-old-mystery-about-the-measles-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;dropped dramatically&lt;/a&gt;. Even deaths from diseases like pneumonia and diarrhea were cut in half.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ratner says as routine childhood vaccination rates fall, the U.S. is likely to see more and larger measles outbreaks. "There's no doubt that we will in the future see the long-term consequences of measles," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But he says we have a safe and powerful tool to prevent those consequences — vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

She blinks slowly, her head heavy. Was it too much wine again last night? Or was it the lorazepam? From the adjacent bathroom, her husband showers, oblivious to the small internal struggle playing out in her mind. The children? They lost interest in their mother long ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="crn26-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="crn26-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="crn26-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;She closes her eyes for a moment, takes a deep breath, and imagines herself as someone else—someone who doesn’t need a pill to get through the day. But reality waits.

Her character drifts through scenes in a daze, caught between sleep and wakefulness, her oversized sunglasses and bright smile masking the growing dependency beneath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="crtpc-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="crtpc-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="crtpc-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Though fictional, Ratliff’s story mirrors a harsh reality. In recent years, addiction to anti-anxiety medications such as Valium, Klonopin, and lorazepam (sold in Israel as Lorivan) has become a global concern, transcending age, class, and geography. What often starts as a "harmless pill for relaxation" can quickly spiral into dependence, making withdrawal a daunting challenge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="49epn-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="49epn-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="49epn-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The rise in prescription drug dependency highlights an alarming trend: an increasing reliance on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a id="ryiUtbViS2Jx" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/bj2hz4liye" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="49epn-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;medications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="49epn-2-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; to manage daily stressors. What begins as a short-term solution can become a chemical prison with devastating effects on mental and physical health. Why is quitting so difficult? How do people get hooked in the first place? And what can be done before the pills take over?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="3qb5-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3qb5-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3qb5-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dr. Chen Avni, a psychiatrist and deputy director of the psychiatric day treatment department at Ramat Hen Mental Health Center in Tel Aviv, explains that these medications belong to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines. "They enhance the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that slows down brain activity. In low doses, they induce relaxation, but in higher doses, they can cause drowsiness, memory impairment, confusion, and loss of balance."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="b9tfc-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="b9tfc-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="b9tfc-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;While the effects are similar to alcohol, benzodiazepines lack the intoxicating high. However, prolonged use can lead to cognitive impairment, decreased alertness, and, in elderly patients, an increased risk of dangerous falls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="cgtgf-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cgtgf-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cgtgf-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;According to Avni, addiction often develops when usage extends beyond the prescribed timeframe. "Initially, these medications are intended for short-term relief—typically no more than six weeks," he says. "The problem arises when patients feel they can’t function without them. That’s when we see cases of dependency, sometimes at alarmingly high doses."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="b89et-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="b89et-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="b89et-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Shahar Cohen, a clinical social worker specializing in addiction treatment, has seen this trend intensify. "Anxiety levels across the population have been rising, especially in the past year and a half," she says. "This isn’t just an individual issue—it affects families, workplaces, and entire communities."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="lv4o-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="2ptkd-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="2ptkd-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;a id="Syh8YW4sBh1e" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/bj2hz4liye" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2ptkd-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Prescription drug addiction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2ptkd-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; cuts across all demographics. Some users first receive medication for legitimate issues like insomnia or acute anxiety. Others turn to them following major life stressors such as job loss, divorce, or a child's military enlistment. In many cases, what starts as a doctor-prescribed solution escalates into self-medication, leading to dependency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="28nie-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="28nie-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="28nie-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;For many, obtaining benzodiazepines legally isn’t enough. "One former patient of mine was using 16 times the recommended dose," Avni recalls. "He bought part of his supply through his healthcare provider and the rest on the black market."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="2nj8l-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="2nj8l-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2nj8l-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;This underground trade of prescription medication underscores a major challenge: when patients become addicted, they will go to great lengths to maintain their supply. "People often don’t realize they’re dependent until it’s too late," Cohen warns. "When the thought of being without the drug becomes unbearable, that’s a red flag."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="1oku7-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="1oku7-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1oku7-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Experts emphasize that addiction must be treated holistically, addressing not just the physical dependency but also the underlying &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a id="SyT8Y114sr3Jx" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/r1ljgw11c0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1oku7-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;emotional triggers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1oku7-2-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;. "Addiction is never just about the drug," Cohen explains. "It’s often about pain—whether emotional or psychological. The drug becomes a coping mechanism."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="bvjnc-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bvjnc-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bvjnc-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;For those struggling with benzodiazepine dependency, gradual withdrawal under medical supervision is crucial. "Abrupt discontinuation can be dangerous, leading to severe withdrawal symptoms like seizures and psychosis," Avni cautions. "I’m currently treating a patient who experienced vivid hallucinations after trying to quit cold turkey. We had to introduce a slow, controlled tapering process."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="7nes1-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="6q4cs-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6q4cs-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6q4cs-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Beyond physical detoxification, long-term recovery requires psychological support. "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective tool, especially for sleep disorders," Avni says. "For chronic anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder, alternative psychiatric treatments that are non-addictive should be considered."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="3ej3q-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3ej3q-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3ej3q-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Awareness around prescription drug dependency is growing, but change is slow. "There are still doctors who hesitate to confront addicted patients and continue writing prescriptions out of convenience or pressure," Avni notes. "But every physician prescribing these drugs should recognize the long-term risks. This isn't just a temporary fix—it can become a lifelong struggle."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="5tu06-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="5tu06-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5tu06-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The Israeli Health Ministry is currently working on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a id="H1xDYW4or2yg" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/bjth2nhxh" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5tu06-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;reforms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5tu06-2-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; to address prescription drug addiction, including establishing specialized treatment clinics within health maintenance organizations (HMOs). These initiatives aim to provide better oversight, education, and intervention before patients spiral into dependency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="ae0v1-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ae0v1-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ae0v1-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Ultimately, the best way to combat prescription drug addiction is prevention. "It’s crucial to start with the lowest effective dose and treat the root cause of the anxiety, insomnia, or distress," Avni advises. "No one is immune to addiction. The key is to monitor usage, avoid increasing dosages without medical guidance, and seek alternative therapies when possible."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="e8a1a-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="e8a1a-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="e8a1a-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Cohen echoes this sentiment. "Science still can’t predict who will become addicted and who won’t, so awareness is critical," she says. "If you suspect dependence—whether in yourself or someone close to you—don’t ignore it. Seeking help early can make all the difference."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="fltml-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="fltml-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="fltml-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Victoria Ratliff’s story may be fictional, but the crisis it highlights is very real. For countless individuals, the journey from prescription to addiction is deceptively short. The challenge now is ensuring that those in need receive the right treatment—before their escape becomes their prison.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 09:55:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE5maEhJQkk0VG5fdm10RldRUDZBMUpYVU1wVk50Zm56bm95ZDRUVjhKVWg4cTF2dGpUQjFlcVRLUkNTVFhmdmhCbW9PaTFrRVc1THM1VkM4aUkzV1NRSmFZbzFWbjVvWFlkR3c</guid></item><item><title>Cocaine laced with fentanyl suspected in Staten Island ER visits, doc warns - SILive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="65TOQDJPSZESPMZOLGHG7QXFEM"&gt;STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — While the number of drug overdose deaths appears to be down on Staten Island at the start of the year, District Attorney Michael E.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Managing screen time is an issue that defines modern parenthood. Teenagers — who often don't want to be managed in any way — present an extra set of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many parents know that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/04/25/1171773181/social-media-teens-mental-health" target="_blank"&gt;too much screen time is harmful &lt;/a&gt;for teenagers and they don't want their kids encountering unhealthy or dangerous content. But figuring out exactly how to provide guardrails to prevent these behaviors is hard. &lt;a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/8-18-census-integrated-report-final-web_0.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Research from Common Sense Media &lt;/a&gt;shows teenage screen time spiked during the pandemic; tweens averaged more than five hours a day and teenagers more than eight.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Parents are yearning for guidance," says Lauren Salem, a mom of four kids who span tween and teen years.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I think there's a lot of big picture guidance but really there's a kind of disconnect between — I get what I'm supposed to do, I get what we're supposed to be aware of — but how do we actually incorporate it in our life and family," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While there is no panacea or easy set of rules for managing screens, researchers at the American Psychological Association (APA) say there are some useful strategies. The organization recently issued&lt;a href="https://healthyviewing.apa.org/" target="_blank"&gt; this guide for parents.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" We really want parents to feel like — rather than throw up their hands and feel like it's totally impossible to monitor everything — give them some tools," says Mitch Prinstein, chief science officer at the APA.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The advice for  teens is different than for younger children. Here are some things to consider.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;1. Understand the digital landscape and the teenage brain&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every single family I work with struggles with screens," says Kent Toussaint, a therapist who founded the &lt;a href="https://teentherapycenter.com/about-us/staff/kent-toussaint/" target="_blank"&gt;Teen Therapy Center i&lt;/a&gt;n Los Angeles and was not involved in this report. " I think a lot of times parents think that kids can self-regulate this and most kids cannot."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers who worked on the new report stress that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/17/1176452284/teens-social-media-phone-habit" target="_blank"&gt;teenage brains are ill-equipped&lt;/a&gt; to navigate today's digital landscape.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"During the teen years, the brain's reward centers are especially sensitive, while the parts that regulate self-control are still developing," the report states. Teen brains are also extra sensitive to peer and social influence; this combination of factors makes it difficult for teens to disengage with platforms that are often designed to engage them and keep them engaged.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;  2. Promote healthy viewing habits &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/social-media-internet/healthy-teen-video-viewing" target="_blank"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that kids who are frequently exposed to content that includes depictions of things like aggressive behavior, bullying or hostile language can become less empathetic. Some content can promote things like self-harm or substance use.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers say it's important to help kids learn how to identify these negative behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Encourage conversations about how different types of content make them feel," the report guidelines suggest. Drawing attention to their feelings helps teens build their own critical thinking skills when it comes to evaluating content.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The report points out that not all screen time is bad. Exposure to prosocial behaviors can help kids cultivate kindness. Teens need to learn to see these patterns themselves, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3. Help them become critical thinkers&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;No parent can sit next to their child every minute that they're watching screens, of course. But Prinstein advises parents to spend time with their child watching content — even if it's short — and have a conversation about it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Focus on the nature of the content rather than getting caught up in keeping track of every video service," advise the authors. "Ask curious, non-judgmental questions about what your teen enjoys watching."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another suggestion is to work together to develop strategies for evaluating content thoughtfully. Kids don't like to be manipulated and can be receptive when parents initiate conversations about advertising, Prinstein says. He suggests pointing out things like the way ads are targeted based on viewing habits. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Or help them to identify sponsored content, even when it's subtly integrated into videos. Discuss how influencers build their audiences and what goes into creating their content, he advises.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;4. Above all, stay engaged   &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Often parents become overwhelmed, says Prinstein, but doing nothing when it comes to teens and screens is the worst possible thing. " When a parent's watching something with kids and something comes on screen that's not okay — maybe there's swearing, maybe there's explicit sex, maybe there's discrimination against others — parents might clam up at that point." If there's no discussion, Prinstein says "kids are more likely to assume that that means parents are a hundred percent okay with what they just saw."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while teens are known for pushing back on parents, therapist Kent Toussaint  stresses that the strength of the relationship between parent and child fundamentally influences a child's habits around any kind of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The more we've invested in connecting and the relationship with our child, the more they're going to cooperate," he says. "The more they're going to work with us on our expectations."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the goal is not to control your child, but to help them learn to exert some measure of self-control, even if it takes practice and is not perfect, Prinstein says. After all, this is a skill even adults struggle with.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; "Sometimes modeling  that all of us are getting sucked in to doing this more than we want," he says, "is helpful."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/news/Pages/20250314_01.aspx"&gt;second man has died&lt;/a&gt; from Japanese encephalitis virus in New South Wales on March 6, the state’s health authorities confirmed on Friday. Aged in his 70s, the man was infected while holidaying in the Murrumbidgee region. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This follows the death of &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/news/Pages/20250225_01.aspx"&gt;another man in his 70s&lt;/a&gt; in Sydney last month, after holidaying in the same region in January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese encephalitis virus has also been detected for the first time in &lt;a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/newsroom/doh-media-releases/be-alert-against-mosquitoes-as-jev-detected-in-brisbane"&gt;mosquitoes collected in Brisbane’s eastern suburbs&lt;/a&gt;, Queensland health authorities confirmed on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With mosquito activity expected to increase thanks to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/first-wind-then-rain-next-come-the-mozzies-heres-how-to-reduce-your-risk-of-bites-and-infections-251260"&gt;flooding rains brought by Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred&lt;/a&gt;, it’s important to protect yourself from mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is Japanese encephalitis virus?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese encephalitis is one of the most serious diseases that &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/japanese-encephalitis"&gt;spreads via mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;, with around 68,000 cases annually across Southeast Asia and Western Pacific regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virus is thought to be maintained in a cycle between mosquitoes and waterbirds. Mosquitoes are infected when they feed from an infected waterbird. They then pass the virus to other waterbirds. Sometimes other animals, and people, can be infected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pigs are also a host, and the virus has spread through &lt;a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity-trade/pests-diseases-weeds/animal/japanese-encephalitis"&gt;commercial piggeries&lt;/a&gt; in Victoria, NSW and Queensland. (But it poses no food safety risk.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feral pigs and &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0012510"&gt;other animals&lt;/a&gt; can also play &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-20/feral-pigs-japanese-encephalitis-queensland/104955158"&gt;a role in transmission cycles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people infected &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/japanese-encephalitis"&gt;show no symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with mild cases may have a fever, headache and vomiting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more serious cases – &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/japanese-encephalitis"&gt;about one in 250 people infected&lt;/a&gt; – people may have neck stiffness, disorientation, drowsiness and seizures. Serious illness can have life-long neurological complications and, in some cases, the infection can be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/japanese-encephalitis/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html"&gt;no specific treatment&lt;/a&gt; for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;When did Japanese encephalitis get to Australia and why is it in Brisbane?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks of Japanese encephalitis had occurred in the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.5694/j.1326-5377.1996.tb124960.x"&gt;Torres Strait during the 1990s&lt;/a&gt;. The virus was also &lt;a href="https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-pubs-cdi-1998-cdi2205-cdi2205d.htm"&gt;detected in the Cape York Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There had been no evidence of activity on the mainland since 2004 but everything changed in the &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/vbz.2022.0037"&gt;summer of 2021–22&lt;/a&gt;. Japanese encephalitis virus was &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/japanese-encephalitis-virus-has-been-detected-in-australian-pigs-can-mozzies-now-spread-it-to-humans-178017"&gt;detected in commercial piggeries&lt;/a&gt; in southeastern Australia during that summer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prompted the declaration of a &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/diseases/japanese-encephalitis"&gt;Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, flooding accompanying the La Niña-dominated weather patterns and a resulting boom in mosquito numbers, and waterbird populations, was thought responsible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virus has spread in subsequent years and has been detected in the mosquito and arbovirus surveillance programs as well as detection in feral pigs and commercial piggeries in most states and territories. Only &lt;a href="https://www.health.tas.gov.au/publications/japanese-encephalitis-virus"&gt;Tasmania has remained free&lt;/a&gt; of Japanese encephalitis virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human cases of infection have also been reported. There were more than 50 cases of disease and &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/news/statement-on-the-end-of-japanese-encephalitis-virus-emergency-response"&gt;seven deaths in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;A/Prof Cameron Webb (NSW Health Pathology)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases of Japanese encephalitis have &lt;a href="https://www.darlingdowns.health.qld.gov.au/about-us/our-stories/news/avoid-the-bite-of-mosquitoes-as-new-cases-of-japanese-encephalitis-virus-detected"&gt;already been reported from Queensland in 2025&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to concern about Japanese encephalitis virus and other mosquito-borne pathogens, health authorities around Australia have expanded and enhanced their surveillance programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Queensland, this includes mosquito monitoring at a number of locations, including urban areas of southeast Queensland. Mosquitoes collected in this monitoring program tested positive for Japanese encephalitis virus, promoting the current health warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why is its detection in Brisbane important?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to now, scientists have thought the risk of Japanese encephalitis was likely greatest following seasons of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771423000861"&gt;above-average rainfall or flooding&lt;/a&gt;. This provides ideal conditions for waterbirds and mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the activity of Japanese encephalitis virus over the summer of 2024–25 has taken many scientists by surprise. Before Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred arrived, there had been somewhat dry conditions with less waterbird activity and low mosquito numbers in many regions of eastern Australia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However there has still been widespread Japanese encephalitis virus activity in &lt;a href="https://www.health.vic.gov.au/health-alerts/japanese-encephalitis-in-victoria"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/news/Pages/20241207_00.aspx"&gt;NSW&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/newsroom/doh-media-releases/queenslanders-urged-to-be-alert-against-mosquito-bites"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, Japanese encephalitis virus activity hasn’t extended to the coastal regions of southeast Queensland. The detection of the virus in suburban Brisbane may require authorities to rethink exactly where the virus may turn up next. Authorities are ramping up their surveillance to see just how widespread the virus is in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health authorities and scientists are also trying to understand how the virus moved from western areas of the state to the coast and what drives virus transmission in different regions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/environment/pests/vector/Pages/surveillance-and-monitoring-weekly-reports-season-2024-25.aspx"&gt;currently no evidence&lt;/a&gt; the virus is active in coastal regions of northern NSW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;

              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;A/Prof Cameron Webb (NSW Health Pathology)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What can people do to protect themselves?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoiding mosquito bites is the best way to reduce the risk of Japanese encephalitis virus.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cover up with long-sleeved shirts and long pants for a physical barrier against mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use topical insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus. Be sure to apply an even coat on all exposed areas of skin for the longest-lasting protection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure any insect screens on houses, tents and caravans are in good repair and reduce the amount of standing water in the backyard. The more water there is around your home, the more opportunities for mosquitoes there are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A safe and effective vaccine is &lt;a href="https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/contents/vaccine-preventable-diseases/japanese-encephalitis"&gt;available against Japanese encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;. Each state and territory health authority (for example &lt;a href="https://www.qld.gov.au/health/condition/infections-and-parasites/viral-infections/japanese-encephalitis"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/jev/Pages/vaccination.aspx"&gt;NSW&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/japanese-encephalitis"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;) have specific recommendations about access to vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may take many weeks following vaccination to achieve sufficient protection, so prioritise reducing your exposure to bites in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Oats contain beta-glucan, a type of soluble fibre that helps lower cholesterol levels and supports heart health, says Rob Hobson, a nutritionist and author of &lt;em&gt;Unprocess Your Family Life&lt;/em&gt;. “It forms a gel in the gut that binds to cholesterol, reducing its absorption and helping to remove it from the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, while oat milk contains some beta-glucan, whole oats provide a more concentrated source when consumed in porridge or muesli or incorporated in other foods such as pancakes or smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What are the downsides?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst many agree that oat milk is the tastiest plant-based alternative, its nutritional profile leaves much to be desired. Oat milk is low in protein and contains more carbohydrates and added sugars than &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/healthiest-animal-milk-cow-horse-goat/"&gt;cow’s milk&lt;/a&gt; and its plant-based competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A splash of it in a hot drink, or consumed in moderation alongside foods high in protein or fibre, is unlikely to have a big effect. However it has a moderate glycemic index of around 60 (for reference, dairy milk is in the mid-30s) which means it causes a quicker spike in blood sugar compared to other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oat milk contains added sugars as a result of processing the oats. The sugars are created when enzymes break down oat starches into simple carbohydrates. These pass into the bloodstream as glucose and can raise blood sugar levels. On average, a cup of oat milk contains around seven grams of added sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When consumed in higher volumes (think the daily oat milk latte) it can cause problems, especially for those with diabetes and other sensitivities, Hope explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I have oat milk in a drink, I tend to have half oat milk and half hot water. Then you’re not having so much because the sugars and calories can add up quickly,” Hope explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the fortified versions – where extra flavourings, thickeners, nutrients and oils are added in – are ultra-processed and can cause inflammation and bloating. This can disrupt the gut microbiome and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to read an oat milk label&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson says that fortified oat milks like Oatly contain added vitamins and minerals that make them a useful swap for cow’s milk. However, for those looking for an option with a minimal ingredient list, he suggests trying Plenish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their organic, unsweetened, gluten-free oat milk contains just water, oats, and sea salt. With 41 calories per 100ml, it is marketed as “preservative-free”, “seed oil-free”, and “UPF-free”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson adds: “If you are trying to avoid ultra-processed foods, then you might want to choose oat milks without stabilisers such as gellan gum or guar gum.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of these are additives that help to thicken the oat milk, improve its shelf life, and keep the ingredients suspended to avoid sediment compounding at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it tends to be that some of the cheaper oat milk options have longer ingredient lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If possible, I’d try to find one that has the basics of oats, water and sea salt and if you’re looking for a fortified version, one which contains vitamin D, B vitamins, calcium, and iodine,” Hobson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Who should avoid it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with coeliac disease or severe gluten sensitivities should consider avoiding oat milk as, even though some versions are marked gluten-free, there is still a cross-contamination risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetics and those with insulin resistance or other sensitivities might also consider opting for a different alternative due to its added sugar content. And whilst many oat milks are gluten free, those with coeliac disease or sensitivities should still take care as they may be processed in facilities that also handle gluten products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with specific nutrition goals, such those who prioritise a high-protein diet might also consider opting for a different type of milk. “If you rely on milk for protein – whether you do a lot of resistance training, are an older adult, or are a vegan looking for higher-protein options – you may be better off choosing a plant milk such as soya, which has a protein content similar to cow’s milk,” Hobson explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those following a low-carbohydrate diet or on a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/recipes-to-help-you-lose-weight-after-40/"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; journey might also opt for a lower-calorie, high protein option or an unsweetened oat milk which better aligns with their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the low protein content, it is not recommended for children younger than five to solely consume oat milk if they are able to drink dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What about the alternatives?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nutritionally, I would put oat milk at the bottom of the list, compared to almond, soya, and dairy,” Hope says. “But taste-wise, I’d absolutely put it at the top.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy and soy milk both provide good levels of protein – with semi-skimmed cows milk containing 3.6g and soya providing 2.4g per 100ml. They are both also &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/calcium-diet/"&gt;rich in calcium&lt;/a&gt; and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, almond milk provides a lower-calorie option compared to its competitors with around 22 calories per 100ml. It has the highest calcium level of all the nut-based milks and is high in vitamin E, iron, and fibre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oat milk has the highest glycemic index compared to almond, soy, and dairy milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dairy, nutritionally, is going to be the best for us in terms of the micronutrients, the protein, and the calcium,” Hope says. She ranks soya in second place, followed by almond, and then finally oat milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Can you drink it every day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it’s high in carbohydrates and calories, oat milk should be consumed in moderation which means it may not be a wise idea to start every day with a creamy oat milk latte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Starbucks grande oat latte is the most calorific of the various plant-based options, with around 184 calories, 9.1g of fat, 21g of carbohydrates, 10g of sugar, 3.3g of fibre and just 2.8g of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a grande almond latte is the lowest calorie option at 82, the soya alternative contains a substantial 10.3g of protein, and the coconut option provides a good amount of fibre with 4.8g.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not everything that we consume needs to be the healthiest thing for us, as long as we know where the food sits in our balanced diet,” Hope says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t want to be mistaken and think that oat milk is a super healthy drink, but it tastes great and I personally love an oat milk matcha. We just need to be aware of how much of it we’re consuming and how regularly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Is it really better than cow’s milk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy milk is naturally rich in B vitamins, iodine, calcium, and is higher in protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38871080/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; conducted at the University of Minnesota in 2024 found that most plant-based alternatives do not deliver the same level of nutrition as cows milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team within the university’s Nutrition Coordinating Centre examined more than 200 plant-based alternatives and compared their nutritional profiles against each other and with cow’s milk.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In Britain, if a farm suspects H5N1 – which is typically spread to poultry via the droppings of wild birds like waterfowl and shorebirds – it is legally required to notify the Department for Environment, Food &amp;amp; Rural Affairs (DEFRA), the agency responsible for animal biosecurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus has telltale signs: birds develop swollen heads, twisted necks, breathing difficulties, body swelling, discoloured droppings, dragging legs, and loss of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most birds die within a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failure to notify the authorities can result in an unlimited fine and a six-month prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After notification, government officials from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) are deployed within 24 hours to carry out laboratory testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the farm is put into lockdown – no birds, equipment, or farm vehicles are allowed to come or go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the test results confirm H5N1, a culling or “depopulation order” is issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;‘Huge’ financial implication bird flu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if only a small portion of birds are sick, the entire flock will be destroyed. Farmers are compensated for the great bulk of birds destroyed, with compensation payments averaging £160,000 per farm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many argue they should be paid more, because compensation is based on the value of any healthy birds that must be culled to contain the virus and does not include the birds that have already died or are sick with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The financial implication of avian influenza is huge, and the emotional strain on affected farmers and their families is devastating, with many now forced to reconsider their future,” James Mottershead, the National Farmers Union poultry board chair, told &lt;em&gt;Poultry Weekly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several methods used in culling, which in Britain is carried out by government contractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One method – heavily criticised by animal rights activists – is known as ventilation shutdown, and is one of the quickest and cheapest ways to kill hundreds of thousands of birds at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It involves sealing off vents that keep the air in a packed poultry shed cool, causing the temperature to rise rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of around three hours, temperatures climb to around 70 degrees celsius – a consequence of the body heat produced by thousands of tightly packed birds – so that their core body temperature soars to a fatal level.&lt;/p&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Telegraph</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPWlNQVXNUM3VkR2VmX3JfRFN2eFlGMjAzNWZ0ZFJWbEdTYUpLSEs5U1RvSFppQXhKY0JpYU1FNXNCZ0J4ZlQ4bThyN0c1ZWo3XzRtX1dJc2tFbnJUT0pMb2xGWC0wallLTkpVVi1aWjdrbDAwTnlJSTlHdk8wX19DelJ0cG50WWthT254YkJaZ2h3VmMydk9zOEw3VHVONmEwTUxlVmdkWU1LZFZLLS1NY1QxQ0V1X2NyWC1DOA</guid></item><item><title>A Hidden Compound in Rosemary Could Help Fight Alzheimer's - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQSGVLQ0tvWm1xbTBGaDdkZHVmWjFTeDdYUFVIbmFieWsxMTU1SzJiVWd3bDdDenV6M1pNNjFvdHNVMnVxM0hDSEhsd3RtUWlGZDBnN1RvTGZEVFRkLXUzR0MwNmU2WlBFdGZOaFMzWlA2dVNRMlYyN2x1Z25WZkVZR2phUWJKSlREYldNbnV6aw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A new approach to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease treatment could be on the horizon, inspired by a compound found in common herbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnosic_acid"&gt;Carnosic acid&lt;/a&gt; is found in rosemary and sage and is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; however, it is unstable in its pure form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now researchers in California have synthesized a stable derivative of the compound, which showed promising results in mouse models of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice that were given the stable derivative had boosts in memory, more neuron synapses, reduced inflammation, and more removal of toxic proteins that are linked to Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That covers multiple signs of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, which can kill off a high proportion of synapses, breaking key neuron communication routes, while memory loss is one of the most noticeable effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155129" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155129" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/NeuralDensity.jpg" alt="Mouse brains" class="wp-image-155129 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/NeuralDensity.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/NeuralDensity-600x276.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155129" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Microscopy images showing an Alzheimer's-like mouse brain (left), and a diAcCA-treated mouse brain (right), with more intense green colors showing more neuronal synapses. (&lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2025/20250319-lipton-alzheimers.html"&gt;Scripps Research&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did multiple different tests of memory, and they were all improved with the drug," &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2025/20250319-lipton-alzheimers.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Stuart Lipton, from the Scripps Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It didn't just slow down the decline, it improved virtually back to normal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main challenges faced by the researchers was getting carnosic acid into a stable form that would last long enough in the brain to have an effect. After extensive tests, they found a suitable &lt;span&gt;di-acetylated &lt;/span&gt;form (diAcCA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gut converts diAcCA to carnosic acid before it enters the bloodstream, where they found it has about 20 percent better absorption than pure carnosic acid. Once converted, the carnosic acid reached therapeutic levels in the brain within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice with a form of Alzheimer's were then given diAcCA or a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; three times a week for three months. The researchers looked at the effects on brain tissue and how well the mice did on exercises designed to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-new-blood-test-identifies-alzheimers-memory-loss-with-90-accuracy"&gt;assess their memory&lt;/a&gt; and ability to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diAcCA compound didn't appear to have any toxic effects on the mice treated with it, and excessive buildups of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-finally-understand-how-the-tangled-proteins-in-dementia-cause-cells-to-die"&gt;proteins known to be signs of Alzheimer's damage&lt;/a&gt; were reduced in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By combating inflammation and oxidative stress with this diAcCA compound, we actually increased the number of synapses in the brain," &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2025/20250319-lipton-alzheimers.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lipton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We also took down other misfolded or aggregated proteins such as phosphorylated tau and amyloid beta, which are thought to trigger Alzheimer's disease and serve as biomarkers of the disease process."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all very promising, although we're still at the early stages here.  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; will be needed to confirm that diAcCA has the same effects in human brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the anti-inflammatory properties of carnosic acid, which have also been recorded in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cddis2016389"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt;, Lipton and his colleagues are hopeful that this same treatment could be used for other conditions linked to inflammation – from type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also potential for diAcCA drugs to be used alongside other &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/latest-alzheimers-drugs-can-add-years-of-independence-to-patient-lives"&gt;treatments for Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; that are now available. As this compound is a modified form of carnosic acid – already known to be safe for consumption – the researchers are hoping new medications can be developed on an accelerated schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It could make existing amyloid  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="155126" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; treatments work better by taking away or limiting their side effects," &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2025/20250319-lipton-alzheimers.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lipton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/14/3/293"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

My cardiologist prescribed metoprolol. At about the same time, I had reduced my intake of magnesium from about 50% of the daily value (DV) to 35%. (This may have preceded the bigeminy onset.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Quite by accident, I read an article recommending magnesium for a heart arrhythmia. Within a week or so of reading the article, I started magnesium gluconate at 100% of the DV. I have been taking this and metoprolol for about a month, and my condition has improved about 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The question is: How can we tell if the magnesium shorting down to 35% was actually the cause and increasing it to 100% was the cure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— L.R.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear L.R.:&lt;/strong&gt; Bigeminy, more precisely ventricular bigeminy, is a term most people probably haven't heard of, but most people have heard of a premature ventricular contraction (PVC). Ventricular bigeminy is when every other beat is a PVC and alternates with regular beats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While this rhythm can happen in people without any heart disease or risk factors, your cardiologist will have considered many underlying causes, such as excess alcohol use, anemia, low oxygen levels, and thyroid disease. A beta blocker like metoprolol is usually the first drug that is used as beta blockers reduce adrenalin levels, reduce the oxygen needs of the heart, and are proven to be effective at reducing the number of PVCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A low magnesium level is another risk factor for PVCs and ventricular bigeminy, and there are case reports of the rhythm going away completely with magnesium. So, while we can't be sure whether your bigeminy was caused by a low magnesium level, the story is suggestive that it's a real possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I don't recommend taking magnesium except in people who have low levels, but 100% of the DV of magnesium is quite safe to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I am a 76-year-old female who weighs 112 pounds. I am 5 feet, 4 inches tall, and in good health. I walk 40 minutes to 1 hour over a very hilly course five days a week and do strength training two days a week. I was just diagnosed with osteoporosis, with my risk of a major osteoporosis fracture being 12.6% and my risk of a hip fracture being 3.8%, according to FRAX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I have Barrett's esophagus that is monitored every three years and take 20 mg of omeprazole for it. I also take 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily and try to eat a high-calcium diet. My only other medication is 50 mg of trazodone for sleep. I have no other medical problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;My primary doctor wants to put me on medication for osteoporosis. Given my situation, which medication would you recommend?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— P.C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear P.C.:&lt;/strong&gt; The FRAX score is a way of combining a person's measured bone density with clinical risk factors like age, sex and weight to provide an estimate of the fracture risk. Most authorities recommend treatment when the risk of a major osteoporotic fracture is greater than 20% or the risk of a hip fracture is greater than 3%. Your primary doctor is following the published literature. (I will note that a revised calculator called the FRAXplus includes additional risk factors and can be found at www.FRAXplus.org/calculation-tool/.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Omeprazole, the medicine you take for Barrett's, protects your esophagus but can cause poor absorption of calcium, which may be an additional risk factor for you. Because of your Barrett's, the normal first-line treatments (oral bisphosphonates) are not recommended. Instead, intravenous bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid once a year are the standard recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Denosumab is another option, but people need to stay on this medication long-term because, unlike bisphosphonates, bone loss occurs rapidly after stopping it.&lt;em&gt; Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Detroit News</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 04:04:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxQcDdYcWt2aTJjcWhsRFY3QzI1MDhlZ0JaQlp0VjByWDA4NFprZTdzNG10NHJBY0JLbm9TSlNVQkxHTzN4dlU0WHZZZkV4UWp4eFF4Vjh2ZmRmVWVDUnlKbE1hZ1prRURYUk5JUkZqSG1ZRVZQQnNwY1NJb3RiNEFRUVphenJlN2dJaWZEdEhaYy1JSFZzSVQ0UzVTMFJhUnVSRFI2REpPc0cwVlZIMXJXOWRsemxManlDcHJ3MDZobnVzbl8xbzdzRjcyMHVJZw</guid></item><item><title>Zoo animals offer promising venue to study brain disorders - The Transmitter: Neuroscience News and Perspectives</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAJBVV95cUxPT2ZLVjhIWEwxalFSRmU2R0c0UWNRc0lBeHVWTEVYRGRtbXZvT29KLUJsaWdPZG0tMnR0dzlnQ0dkRXB0S0lRQnpNZ0dhR1dSVHRSMlg3OHE3RExHZ3pTTWkyOUJ0UUFubVBlcVFfUXAweFBTZjFNODdhRk40V0hia1Q3MlQ5OHJ3c3BfSWRCdEJWYnJNRVlBWXdEZVhyU2E0UzNldlZwZ3JNcEhLQ0ZjOENlbVJMRjd6eUI4X2ZNcThSWC1hemRFclRqQ1RhaG1VRU5aNXlJM2I4MjJJQ0ZHNXBZYm9vaXFFTzlkZk40Y040N2pVTGVrb2M4UTR0N01NRjF4aQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="font-serif text-1sm text-dark-brown tracking-normal-lg lg:tracking-wide lg:text-3sm lg:leading-8"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Neuroscience research relies overwhelmingly on a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05034-3" target="_blank"&gt;single model system&lt;/a&gt;—the mouse—to address human health challenges. Yet mice rarely replicate the complexity of human diseases, particularly in the brain, and treatments that show promise in mice often fail to translate effectively to people. Studying endangered animals in zoos could be a powerful approach to simultaneously improve animal welfare and advance human brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory experiments done in mice are valuable; they provide a highly controlled environment to uncover causal relationships between variables. But mice don’t often spontaneously develop a disease of interest, and genetically engineered mice in isolated labs &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2013.08.006" target="_blank"&gt;fail to capture the environmental factors&lt;/a&gt; that can play a critical role in the development and manifestation of complex human diseases. We have invested heavily in the genetics of mouse models to study mental health, but those studies have revealed that gene variants often have a small impact on the etiology of many human mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harnessing biodiversity offers a new route to understand the complex interplay between genetics and environment in mental and other health issues and could simultaneously help improve the well-being of endangered animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="flex flex-col text-center text-red font-serif-text mt-5 mb-4 lg:my-12 lg:w-1/2 lg:ml-14 lg:-mr-52 lg:mt-16 lg:mb-6 lg:float-right lg:flex-row lg:flex-start lg:text-start"&gt;
    
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p class="font-light italic text-2sm p-0 lg:text-3md"&gt;
            Harnessing biodiversity offers a new route to understand the complex interplay between genetics and environment.        &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans and zoo animals, for example, share several health concerns. Many endangered zoo animals are sedentary, overweight and live relatively long lives. Some suffer from depression and anxiety—you might have seen a polar bear, panda or lion pacing back and forth in their enclosure at the zoo, an indicator of anxiety known as stereotypy. Indeed, many zoo animals are treated with the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1638/2015-0146.1" target="_blank"&gt;same antidepressants&lt;/a&gt; commonly used to reduce depression and anxiety in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying how enclosure size, social interactions and exercise influence mental health in endangered species offers a new way to explore how specific environmental factors affect the brain, and it could identify concrete ways to improve conditions for zoo animals. For species with thousands of animals in captivity, such as tigers, we could harness big data to identify the interactions between genetic and environmental factors, such as stress and exercise, that underpin depressive or anxiety-like behaviors across multiple species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="first-letter:text-2xl first-letter:float-left first-letter:text-red first-letter:pr-2 pb-0"&gt;
    Z&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
oo animals also offer the opportunity to study brain health over the lifespan. As part of their medical care, some animals undergo MRIs for neurological checkups and diagnosis. And preliminary evidence suggests that aged zoo animals may experience brain structure and cognitive changes similar to those that occur with human aging; some veterinarians report cognitive impairment in old tigers (though there is no agreed-upon test to assess cognitive dysfunction in these animals), with one study reporting evidence of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2022.827870" target="_blank"&gt;brain atrophy in an 18-year-old tiger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Some species may even spontaneously recapitulate age-related diseases, making them valuable model systems.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same is true for household pets, such as cats and dogs. Because they are relatively long-lived and often receive regular veterinary care, they provide a particularly good opportunity to study age-related diseases. Like humans, some cats and dogs show signs of cognitive decline later in later life. And unlike mice, cats and dogs spontaneously develop brain plaques and tangles, the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. Because these animals naturally display age-related decline, treatments that prove effective in cats and dogs are more likely to translate to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, a single species is unlikely to provide definitive answers for complex human diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining insights from multiple systems and from different environments will be the best route to enhancing human and animal brain health—each species provides different and complementary insights into biomedical challenges. Successfully leveraging this information requires new tools for integrating information across species. Many model systems, including mice, cats and tigers, develop and age faster than humans. My team is expanding on a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4522(01)00171-3" target="_blank"&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="http://www.translatingtime.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Translating Time&lt;/a&gt;, which enables the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5746-12.2013" target="_blank"&gt;alignment of ages&lt;/a&gt; across a variety of species. This tool helps scientists study how biological dysfunctions in model systems &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad230" target="_blank"&gt;map onto humans&lt;/a&gt; and how information from humans can be used to support animal health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the promise of these approaches, funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health—as least as it currently stands—remains heavily focused on mouse models of disease. To truly understand how genetic predisposition and environmental influences interact to produce complex diseases, we need to study different species living in complex environments. Zoo and companion animals offer a ready setting to do this, but collecting large amounts of genetic and phenotypic information will require substantial investment and buy-in from the research community. Once we have these data in hand, machine-learning models can help process it and sort out which genes and environmental factors are important for healthy aging and disease progression. The outcomes will benefit both humans and animals—by identifying environmental factors that contribute to brain health and new avenues for treatment that are applicable to different species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because outbreaks primarily affect sub-Saharan Africa, pharmaceutical companies have lacked financial incentives to develop treatments, and the sporadic nature of outbreaks has made  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="155142" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola#/media/File:Ebola_virus_virion.jpg"&gt;CDC/PD&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're really trying to come up with something that was more practical, easier to use, that could be used to help prevent, control, and contain outbreaks," Thomas Geisbert, a virologist at The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, who led the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw0659"&gt;new study published in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, told AFP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their experiment, Geisbert and colleagues tested the antiviral Obeldesivir, the oral form of intravenous Remdesivir, originally developed for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="155142" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obeldesivir is a "polymerase inhibitor," meaning it blocks an enzyme crucial for viral replication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team infected rhesus and cynomolgus macaques with a high dose of the Makona variant of the Ebola virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day after exposure, ten monkeys then received an Obeldesivir pill daily for ten days, while three control monkeys received no treatment and died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obeldesivir protected 80 percent of the cynomolgus macaques and 100 percent of the rhesus macaques, which are biologically closer to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug not only cleared the virus from the treated monkeys' blood but also triggered an immune response, helping them develop  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="155142" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; while avoiding organ damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geisbert explained that while the number of monkeys was relatively small, the study was statistically powerful because they were exposed to an extraordinarily high dose of the virus – roughly 30,000 times the lethal dose for humans. This reduced the need for additional control monkeys, limiting unnecessary animal deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researcher, who has worked on Ebola since the 1980s and is credited with discovering the Reston strain, said one of the most exciting aspects of Obeldesivir is its "broad-spectrum" protection, compared to the approved antibody treatments that only work against the Zaire species of Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's a huge advantage," Geisbert said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical maker Gilead is currently advancing Obeldesivir to Phase 2 clinical trials for Marburg virus, a close relative of Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geisbert also emphasized the importance of funding from the US National Institutes of Health, amid reports that dozens of grants have been canceled under President Donald Trump's administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"All these drugs and vaccines that were developed against Ebola and a lot of these exotic  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="155142" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; and pathogens – 90 percent of the money comes from the US government," he said, adding, "I think the general public would agree we need treatments for Ebola."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Simply looking at nature – or even just digital pictures of it – can relieve pain, according to new research which scanned the brains of people receiving electrical shocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature's many health benefits have been documented by decades of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 40 years ago, a pioneering study showed that hospitalized patients needed fewer painkillers and recovered quicker when they looked out of a window onto green space rather than a brick wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yet until now, the underlying reasons for this effect were unclear," said Maximilian Steininger, a neuroscientist at the University of Vienna and lead author of a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56870-2"&gt;study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that both nature and pain can be subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because people like nature, it could have a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="155141" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; effect. Or what if it is not nature that reduces pain, but city life that increases it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155158" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155158" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Neurologic-pain-signature-642x685.jpg" alt="Neurologic pain signature" class="size-medium wp-image-155158" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Neurologic-pain-signature-642x685.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Neurologic-pain-signature-389x415.jpg 389w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Neurologic-pain-signature-600x640.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Neurologic-pain-signature.jpg 656w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155158" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The brain response shows overall brain activity involved in processing the location and intensity of pain. This response was lower when people were exposed to virtual nature scenes compared to urban or indoor scenes. (Max Steininger/University of Vienna)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out more, the researchers recorded the brain activity of 49 volunteers using functional  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="155141" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fRMI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subjects looked at different images while receiving a series of electric shocks – some more painful than others – on the back of their left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first scene depicted a lake surrounded by trees blowing in the wind, while the sounds of rustling leaves and birdsong played in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second scene, some urban elements such as buildings, benches and alleyways were added, while city noise intruded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third scene was of an office, with the accompanying drab furniture and whir of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Important practical implications'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did the participants report feeling less pain when they looking at the natural landscapes, the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="155141" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fMRI scans&lt;/a&gt; showed there was a difference in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study is the first to provide evidence from brain scans that this isn't just a placebo effect," Steininger said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076537"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature scenes provoked decreased activity in a part of the brain involved in perceiving pain, called nociception. However other areas linked to regulating pain were not significantly affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers said the results could be because natural environments capture people's attention, diverting them away from the sensation of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is known in psychology as the "attention restoration theory".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fact that this pain-relieving effect can be achieved through a virtual nature exposure which is easy to administer has important practical implications," said study co-author Alex Smalley from the UK's Exeter University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also "opens new avenues for research to better understand how nature impacts our minds," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY, Calif. (VVNG.com) –&lt;/strong&gt; The San Bernardino County Public Health Department has confirmed four pediatric influenza-related deaths for the 2024-2025 flu season. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the deceased children, two did not have any known medical conditions, while the other two had significant underlying health issues. Notably, all four children were unvaccinated against influenza this season.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We extend our sincerest condolences to the families of these children. These fatalities are a reminder that influenza can be a serious and often deadly disease among our most vulnerable populations,” said San Bernardino County Health Officer Dr. Sharon Wang.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The flu season typically spans from November 1 to April 30 each year, with flu-related emergency room visits usually peaking between December and February. This season has seen a concerning 64.6 percent increase in hospitalizations compared to the previous year, the county confirmed in a &lt;a href="https://main.sbcounty.gov/2025/03/13/county-confirms-flu-related-pediatric-deaths/"&gt;written statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To protect yourself and your loved ones, it’s essential to understand flu symptoms, recognize when to seek medical care, and adopt preventive measures,” the county stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends an annual flu shot for everyone six months of age and older. Other preventive measures include frequent handwashing, wearing masks in crowded or high-risk environments, avoiding close contact with those who are sick, and regularly disinfecting commonly touched surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;				
				



&lt;p&gt;Pregnant women, children, the elderly, and individuals with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease are particularly at risk for severe flu complications, and are urged by the county to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flu symptoms typically include fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, sore throat, runny nose, and fatigue. Children may also experience vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have trouble breathing, persistent chest pain, confusion or bluish lips or face, seek medical care immediately,” the statement read. “If you are at higher risk and develop flu symptoms, contact your healthcare provider right away. Early antiviral treatment can help reduce severe illness.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more information on influenza, please visit the California Department of Public Health’s Influenza page. For further inquiries, the county’s Public Health Communicable Disease Section can be reached at 1-800-722-4794 or by email at &lt;a&gt;CDS@dph.sbcounty.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I work a serving job, which requires a lot of moving and I normally walk my dog over a mile daily.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'[But] I was feeling embarrassed that my clothes didn't fit, or that I didn't like the way I looked. I would still attend social gatherings, but I wasn't as confident as I usually am.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After tolerating her symptoms for a few months, she decided to visit her primary care doctor and was told to get blood tests to rule out &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-84d6f150-00f2-11f0-9713-057e655d193b"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; or other serious health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luckily, they were negative, but that left Adesso still scrambling for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Briana Adesso, 31, an elementary special education teacher pictured here before her hypothyroidism diagnosis in August 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She had gained about 40 pounds in the span of six months between late 2022 to early 2023. Pictured here in April 2023, a month before her diagnosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her doctor then took an&lt;span&gt; ultrasound of her thyroid - a butterfly-shaped gland that &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12744113/Bizarre-symptom-thyroid-cancer.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;produces hormones that regulate metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, growth, and development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It revealed multiple benign growths on the gland itself which were interfering with hormone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was diagnosed with hypothyroidism - or an underactive thyroid - which had caused her metabolism to crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Metabolism is the body's ability to convert food and drink into energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having a slow metabolism means the body burns fewer calories at rest, making it easier to gain weight and harder to lose it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is also known to impact appetite and people may experience food cravings and increased calorie intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also cause muscle weakness, thinning hair, dry skin, impaired memory function, low moods and changes in blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About five percent of people in the US aged 12 and older experience some degree of hypothyroidism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Eve Bloomgarden, an endocrinologist at Northwestern Medicine explained: 'Hypothyroidism from any cause results in a decrease in energy metabolism, or the basal metabolic rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Patients often experience a modest amount of weight gain prior to diagnosis because of this metabolic slowing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kimberly Bethel from the Trotwood Physician Center in Ohio further added: 'The thyroid’s function is to regulate the metabolism of the body - how fast or slow things go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It affects everything from the top of the head all the way down to the toes. And we know it affects a person’s weight. If you are a fast metabolizer you will burn more calories, or if you are a slow metabolizer, you’re going to gain weight.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hypothyroidism can be caused by a multitude of reasons, including an iodine deficiency, pituitary gland disorders such as non-cancerous tumors and thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid that can happen after a viral illness or pregnancy). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to thyroid issues, Ms Adesso was also found to be suffering from insulin resistance - a condition in which the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, which can cause weight gain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following her diagnosis in 2023, she was prescribed Synthroid - a drug regularly used to treat hypothyroidism - and semaglutide - the active ingredient in weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Adesso said she has managed to 50 pounds as of this month. She is pictured here in March 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also maintained her healthy lifestyle by continuing to work out and eat healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The combination of treatments was working, but her insurance stopped paying for the semaglutide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While her insurance initially covered it, she eventually was forced to pay out of pocket - with a monthly supply of semaglutide typically costing $1,350. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: 'My endocrinologist prescribed me Synthroid and Semaglutide. On top of the medications, I maintain a healthy, well balanced diet and continue to be very active.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since starting her regimen, Ms Adesso told this website she has managed to lose 50lbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I am extremely thankful for Semaglutide. There is such a stigma around taking this medicine but it truly helped me so much.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Having both hypothyroidism and insulin resistance made it nearly impossible for me to lose weight, no matter how many diets I went on or the amount of exercise I did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Unfortunately my insurance stopped covering this medication and I was paying out of pocket for many months, but it truly was such a key factor in my success of losing weight.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNTGpyTUZaSFdyMVAxR3ZfZTIzc1k0c1FXOHRWcHBNUW5SVXdBNTdYS2hkMzNqbWxIVkJHa0dRUm9WRDY0UWljbFJuQlc3OUhuTEZLemREVVlSdmpTUG9FeUF6OHIwVnJwQmhGdTJnSXd2WWVLMkdyTzVhYkpxYmJTS3l6cFZGblZ3dlhTLWNTSVhUbXhxS1EwbmdYd2QtaVZ3aEJMODUxVdIBrAFBVV95cUxNLVlzZDYtcHBXeUFhNGdER2M2T25wQ3ZJZmNzRVdwa004RDVNZ01mQ2lNWnBvcm5ndWxzTERial9lTEgtd3VVdnkxajBkeV9sSG90bElTMkFwV1Vqa0JETTVKeTVQR2pfWFRSSFdmdVVSRjlKb1N5amMxQWU4RGhqQUVna29IMkpIelJqV0Y4ZVprNnk1YXBmaDMwQUJUdWtoeVhxOXlUWkgyVGhU</guid></item><item><title>Doctors Are Changing Their Advice About Blood Sugar for Older People - InsideHook</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE03aTl5S25oTFFMTEVuVy1pVk1HUE5WdVVWY09RVEFKMnFON0JaTHlaQjhWMTdYYWZRSXgxcnFyWjJRT2ZGOU05WEZGMlpwUWJrMjJ2dl9obFcyR3NQbkZOZXlSZGdzMVdmUm9GQjZyaEdPYUR4X0pTVNIBfkFVX3lxTE1uY29adkRRbDlFZFBXOXY3OE9WQzlxTE5lOWpQcjlpY0lPc2gwQjE0TFhjTVMzN3IxMV83R0tKWndLRTliVHEzTWxjdl9MMWZ3bHlPWDlvUWNydElKMHpQR19VRDg0NkE5OV9ZU1VNNmVvVVVnNkFVeE5QbElPdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content"&gt;
							
&lt;p&gt;As we age, is it more important to keep one’s blood sugar levels from getting too high or too low? In a perfect world, the answer would be “both” — but a growing number of doctors are now leaning towards a higher tolerance for higher blood sugar as we grow older.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the Mayo Clinic and other experts &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoglycemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373685"&gt;have pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, hypoglycemia — when someone’s levels of blood sugar go below the standard range — is a condition that needs to be treated as quickly as possible. In a recent &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/health/diabetes-blood-sugar-age.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, Paula Span explained why doctors working with older Americans are starting to emphasize preventing blood sugar levels from getting too low, even if that means that those same levels could go too high.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Sei Lee of the University of California, San Francisco told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that maintaining precise control of one’s blood sugar isn’t as important as one ages. “It was really important when you were 50. Now, it’s less important,” Dr. Lee said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Span points out that medical guidelines on what blood sugar levels are considered “too high” have evolved over the years, with organizations like the American Geriatrics Society and the American Diabetes Association advocating for higher hemoglobin a1c levels for older Americans living with diabetes and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt; 



	




&lt;p&gt;Experts have also observed that trying to control blood sugar too much as patients age can have negative effects on its own. Another expert cited in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article, Dr. Joseph G. Ouslander, criticized what he referred to as “the astoundingly high rates of overtreatment of diabetes in older people in general” in &lt;a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.19201"&gt;an editorial&lt;/a&gt; published last year in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Geriatrics Society&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As with managing any chronic condition, finding the right balance here is optimal. But what that right balance might be is very different for someone who’s 40 and someone who’s 80. &lt;/p&gt;

But &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14461221/Im-pharmacist-three-vitamins-tell-avoid.html"&gt;there can be too much&lt;/a&gt; of a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While vitamins are touted as good for you, the body isn't designed to handle excessive vitamin intake.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Humans have evolved to require only small amounts, naturally found in a wide variety of foods, to support cell and organ function, and the body isn't able to quickly eliminate excess vitamins, allowing some to build to dangerous levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Supplement overdoses can lead to serious complications, including liver and kidney damage, hardening of soft tissues, bleeding, and nerve damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, because it can take weeks or even months for signs of toxicity from some vitamins to cause symptoms, you may be causing damage without even realizing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of overdose depends on the base recommendation. For instance, the recommended amount of vitamin A for adult men is 900 micrograms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, taking too much - about three to four times the recommendation - can lead to minor symptoms like a headache or severe complications like brain damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Iron is essential for producing hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in red blood cells, but taking over 20mg can be toxic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Iron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for adults: 8 milligrams (mg) for men; 18 mg for women&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron plays a key role in the production of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body, but too much, around 20mg or higher, can be toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of iron toxicity may start out minor and be blamed on something common like the stomach flu and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, severe iron poisoning can lead to severe complications like liver damage and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The harm becomes even more severe when a person takes too much over a long period of time. Gradually, iron accumulates in the organs, causing potentially fatal damage to the brain and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron supplement overdose over an extended period of time mimics a natural iron balance disorder called iron overload. This is caused by the body’s regulatory system failing to keep iron levels within healthy limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, an excess of iron can increase one’s risk of arthritis, colon cancer, liver problems, diabetes, and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Calcium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for adults 51 and up: 1,000 to 1,200 mg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adequate calcium is crucial to shoring up the bones and keeping skeletal muscles working properly. Calcium supplements are often recommended to seniors who are at increased risk of deficiency and osteoporosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brittle bones make severe breaks and fractures more likely, especially in the hips, spine, risk, and forearm. They’re likely to be painful and require surgery to repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it's important to strike the right balance. Taking more than 1,200 mg can lead to hypercalcemia, in which too much calcium is circulating in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can cause a wide range of symptoms from seemingly innocuous nausea and constipation, to more concerning effects like dehydration, confusion and disorientation, muscle and bone pain, high blood pressure, kidney damage, and even coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Severe cases of vitamin D overdose can lead to kidney failure and abnormal heart rhythm, as well as an unsteady gait, confusion, fatigue, constipation, nausea, bone pain, and muscle weakness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for adults: 600 International Units (IU)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D is often thoughts of as the sunshine vitamin as people can get it from about 15 minutes of being in the sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those who prefer the shade, however, doctors recommend 600 international units (IU). Taking extremely high doses – around 4,000 IU – over a long period of time can cause vitamin D toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Severe cases can lead to kidney failure and abnormal heart rhythm, as well as an unsteady gait, confusion, fatigue, constipation, nausea, bone pain, and muscle weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases of vitamin D toxicity are rare, with roughly 4,500 cases in the US every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While sunlight is an excellent source of vitamin D, spending too much time outdoors will not cause vitamin D toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D toxicity doesn't occur suddenly and you may be experiencing it without even realizing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, it occurs when a person takes large doses of supplements over months or years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Vitamin A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for adults: 900 microgram retinol activity equivalents (mg RAE) for men, 700 mcg RAE for women&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin A is crucial for vision, immunity and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But exceeding 3,000 mcg RAE of vitamin A can, over time, cause significant organ damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin A toxicity leads to hypervitaminosis A. Taking a lot over a short amount of time has been known to cause nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, loss of appetite, and headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chronic over-use causes the liver to malfunction and become enlarged until it fails. High vitamin A levels may also cause weakened bones, increasing the risk of fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women who take too much vitamin A also risk birth defects in their babies, such as a cleft palate or cleft lip, congenital heart defects, brain malformations, and thyroid problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women are generally advised not to exceed 770 mcg RAE per day, which can come from cod liver oil, egg yolks, whole milk, cheese, and beef liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Too much magnesium can cause diarrhea, low blood pressure, breathing difficulty, irregular heart rhythm, kidney damage, and coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for adults: between 310 to 410 mg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Magnesium is essential for maintaining bone density, muscle function, and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The powerful mineral can also improve sleep quality and heart health by regulating the heart’s rhythm. It has also been shown to help reduce stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Too much magnesium, though, can cause diarrhea, low blood pressure, breathing difficulty, irregular heart rhythm, kidney damage, and coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases or if the kidneys aren’t working well, dialysis might be needed to remove the excess magnesium from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hypermagnesemia is rare because the kidneys remove excess magnesium. But complications can occur in people with kidney problems who take magnesium-containing medications like laxatives or antacids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with kidney disease, heart disease, or digestive issues are at higher risk and should avoid magnesium supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Folic acid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for adults: 400 mcg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Recommended daily dose for pregnant women: at least 600 mcg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Folic acid helps prevent birth defects in a baby’s brain and spine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Folic acid is commonly taken by pregnant women or women trying to conceive as it helps prevent birth defects in a baby’s brain and spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mineral plays a crucial role in producing red blood cells in utero and supports the development of the baby’s neural tube into their brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Folic acid also works alongside other vitamins such as B12 to control high levels of an amino acid called homocysteine, which has been associated with an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In high amounts, however, folic acid can obscure a deficiency of B12, which can lead to severe nerve damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When taken in large quantities, folic acid can correct low red blood cell counts, but it does not address potential nerve damage that has gone undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Too much folic acid can also irritate the digestive system, causing bloating, gas, and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Institutes of Health officials have urged scientists to remove all references to mRNA vaccine technology from their grant applications, two researchers said, in a move that signaled the agency might abandon a promising field of medical research.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The mRNA technology is under study at the NIH for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, including flu and AIDS, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/pancreatic-cancer-vaccine/"&gt;also cancer&lt;/a&gt;. It was deployed in the development of covid-19 vaccines credited with &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/report-covid-19-vaccines-saved-us-115-trillion-3-million-lives"&gt;saving 3 million lives&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. alone — an accomplishment &lt;a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-operation-warp-speed-vaccine-summit/"&gt;President Donald Trump bragged about&lt;/a&gt; in his first term.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A scientist at a biomedical research center in Philadelphia wrote to a colleague, in an email reviewed by KFF Health News, that a project officer at NIH had “flagged our pending grant as having an mRNA vaccine component.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s still unclear whether mRNA vaccine grants will be canceled,” the scientist added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIH officials also told a senior NIH-funded vaccine scientist in New York state, who does not conduct mRNA vaccine research but described its efficacy in previous grant applications, that all references to mRNA vaccines should be scrubbed from future applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists relayed their experiences on the condition of anonymity for fear of professional retaliation by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A senior official at the National Cancer Institute confirmed that NIH acting Director Matthew Memoli sent an email across the NIH instructing that any grants, contracts, or collaborations involving mRNA vaccines be reported up the chain to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s office and the White House.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Memoli sent a similar message ahead of the agency canceling other research, such as studies of vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Memoli’s email on that topic bluntly stated that NIH was not interested in learning why people shun vaccines or in exploring ways to “improve vaccine interest and commitment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The National Cancer Institute official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said that “it is reasonable to assume mRNA vaccine work is next.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The official said a similar memo also went out regarding NIH-funded work in South Africa, which the White House has targeted over false claims that the country’s government is persecuting white people. More recently, another one went out regarding all global research collaborations, the official said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for the White House, HHS, and the NIH did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIH, whose latest annual budget was $47 billion, is one of the world’s most critical sources of funding for basic biomedical research. Its mission and programs are under unprecedented scrutiny from Trump’s White House and the Department of Government Efficiency, the Elon Musk-led agency&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;created by a Trump executive order that has directed federal agencies to prepare for widespread layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIH is funding at least 130 studies involving the mRNA technology in covid vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna that have been administered to billions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A former government official familiar with internal discussions said that the Trump administration intends to cut some grants for mRNA vaccine research but that the timing is unclear. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships with the administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Political conservatives in the U.S. have promulgated conspiracy theories, unsupported by scientific evidence, that the shots and their relatively new technology are dangerous. This has undermined public support for covid vaccinations and mRNA research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There will not be any research funded by NIH on mRNA vaccines,” the scientist in New York said in an interview. “MAGA people are convinced that these vaccines have killed and maimed tens of thousands of people. It’s not true, but they believe that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, hundreds of other vaccine-related studies are in limbo. Kawsar Talaat, a vaccine researcher at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, has been waiting since the fall for money needed to recruit subjects for a study of an antidiarrheal vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“NIH approved our funding,” she said, “and now we’re waiting, and we don’t know if it’s going forward or going to be killed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientist in Philadelphia signaled that he believes Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, is responsible for the NIH’s turn against mRNA research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Kennedy’s war on vaccines has started,” the scientist told his colleague.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. appears at his nomination hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Jan. 29, 2025.&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;(Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientist in New York said that it was “ridiculous” to remove mRNA language from the grant applications. But “if my grant is rejected for any reason,” the scientist said, “people in my lab will lose their jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve worked with some of them for 20 years,” the scientist added. “They have children and families. There is a real climate of fear in academia about this now, especially among vaccine scientists.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My grant does not involve a request for funds to conduct mRNA vaccine experiments,” the scientist said, “so my principal concern was to avoid word-search flags that, at minimum, would lead to delays in any funding.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While tenured research professors at universities generally receive a salary from their institution, the staffers who work in their labs and offices are often paid through NIH grants. The &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/press-release/"&gt;2023 Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; in physiology or medicine was given to two scientists for developing mRNA vaccines, through work that relied on pharmaceutical companies and on NIH scientists working under infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/"&gt;According to Sen. Bill Cassidy&lt;/a&gt;, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the chamber’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Kennedy promised during his Senate confirmation process that he would protect “the public health benefit of vaccination” and “work within the current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems, and not establish parallel systems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cassidy, a physician, had expressed reservations about confirming Kennedy to the HHS post and challenged his anti-vaccine views during a confirmation hearing. He ended up voting for him, he said, because &lt;a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/"&gt;Kennedy had agreed&lt;/a&gt; to work closely with Cassidy and his committee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Kennedy has faced scrutiny in his first weeks in office for his handling of a large measles outbreak among mostly unvaccinated people in Texas that has led to the death of a child, the first U.S. measles death in more than a decade. A patient who tested positive for measles died in New Mexico, but the cause hasn’t been confirmed. Instead of urging vaccination against the disease, an almost surefire way to prevent infection, Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/measles-more-likely-severe-among-malnourished-rfk-says"&gt;blamed malnourishment for the outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, promoted unproven treatments for measles, and falsely claimed &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112"&gt;in one Fox News interview&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccine is ineffective and even dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cassidy did not respond to a request for comment on the NIH’s potential abandonment of mRNA vaccine research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of the Trump administration’s push to examine spending on mRNA vaccines, health officials are reviewing a $590 million contract for bird flu shots that the Biden administration awarded to Moderna, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-26/trump-administration-orders-bird-flu-shot-review-as-risks-rise&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=docs&amp;amp;ust=1742157241275120&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1ljj05wrVfb8mqwVwTd4ML"&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-26/trump-administration-orders-bird-flu-shot-review-as-risks-rise"&gt; has reported&lt;/a&gt;. Legislation introduced by GOP lawmakers in at least seven states is aimed at &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/mrna-vaccines-trump-boast-under-gop-attacks-legislation/"&gt;banning or limiting mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, the measures would hit doctors who give the injections with criminal penalties, fines, and the possible revocation of their licenses.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — One young girl is about to spend her third consecutive birthday at Primary Children's Hospital. Sienna, 4, was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and needs an artificial heart and a medical team to keep her alive until a heart transplant is available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sienna is the youngest of three children in her family and she has been in the hospital since early 2023. Her mom said they live 45 minutes away from the hospital — when traffic is good. Family comes to stay with the girl every day — either Sienna's mom, dad or grandparents. Sienna's mom said her upcoming birthday is a difficult milestone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You hope that you know, that's not their life story," Francesca Barton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges of her long stay, a new cardiac rehabilitation program introduced at Primary Children's Hospital is significantly improving her life right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bringing the pizzazz&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica Pavlock, an exercise physiologist and cardiac rehab lead, said she met Sienna about six months after the long hospital stay began. The girl was sitting, watching TV and not moving much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Active play wasn't really part of Sienna's day," Pavlock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowly, she said, the girl started walking to the end of the hallway, pushing weights and picking things up off the floor. Now, Sienna looks forward to exercises and always wants to go for a run and sing — Pavlock said the nurses have to work to keep up with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She doesn't even realize she's working out at this point," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sienna Barton, 4, pushes a doll in a stroller at Primary Children's Hospital. She is one of the first heart patients to participate in the cardiac rehab program. (Photo: Intermountain Health)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They bring along a speaker to play music and make it fun — individualizing treatment to each patients' interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We definitely bring the pizzazz," Pavlock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you walk past Sienna's room she is having a dance party and singing. Pavlock said she is now active for the majority of each day, as a healthy child would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dan Ziebell, a pediatric cardiologist and director of the cardiac rehab program, said cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program to build physical strength in heart patients. For patients like Sienna, he said it is helping prepare her and build strength to help her recover from her eventual heart transplant. Ziebell said the exercise, three times a week, is keeping her from becoming weak due to the hospital stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our program is very intentional about getting her very active, and as active as she can," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A unique program&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ziebell said the program helps outpatient children learn their limits and can lead to them participating in physical education classes or sports, even amid their various ailments. The program consists of 36 sessions in three months and then patients graduate with the confidence and training to exercise on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This program is unique because it is geared toward children, he said, adding that cardiac rehabilitation is mainstream for adult heart patients. Primary Children's is, however, one of the first facilities to adapt the program for young kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ziebell said about 15 patients are currently involved in the program, in addition to others who have graduated over the last few years. The program is available at both Primary Children's locations in Utah and as a telemedicine program for children who can't easily travel to Utah or Salt Lake counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regularly assisted exercise teaches kids how to exercise independently, and hospital data and parent feedback show the program is making a difference, Ziebell said. It lays a foundation for other comprehensive heart programs to grow, and eventually, this process will be the standard of care like it is for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They need to be kids, despite having a heart condition," he said. "If we're going to promote lifelong health we need to get these kids active very young."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A health care provider checks Sienna Barton's heart at Primary Children's Hospital. She is one of the first heart patients to participate in the cardiac rehab program. (Photo: Intermountain Health)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pavlock said taking Sienna into the hall requires a "whole squad." They need two nurses to carry the ventricular assistance device, or artificial heart, and her medications in an IV bag. Sienna was one of the first two patients to participate in the program, and they both started on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It not only helps improve their physical health, but their mental health as well because they feel so strong after completing the program that they go out and they're able to do it. They're not scared to exercise anymore. … They're living their lives," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ready for a transplant&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barton wants her family to live together again, but that won't happen until her daughter gets a heart transplant — eliminating the need for an artificial heart — and goes through a recovery process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said Sienna is happy at the hospital but isn't able to interact with many other kids because of the need to keep all of the children there healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get her involved in exercise the team uses Taylor Swift, hanging a Bluetooth speaker on the IV pole, and takes her outside to throw rocks in the pond. Barton said they try to help her discover the outdoors, which is limited for Sienna because of the need for staff to help her move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One time we found a ladybug, and for months after, they would take her out there to the grassy area, and they would build a house for the ladybug," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barton said the therapy has strengthened her body and kept her from being sedentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The strength is already there and the fight is already in there, the bite is in there — she's ready. The spiciness is there, and all you need is that new heart and the rest of the body will teach it how to go, teach it how to keep up," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Barton family poses for a photo. Sienna Barton, 4, is one of the first heart patients at Primary Children's Hospital to participate in the cardiac rehab program. (Photo: Michelle Paul)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of Sienna's blood type, and how far Salt Lake City is from most of the large population centers she is one of only a few children in the U.S. who has waited for a heart for this long at the highest status of need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barton encouraged people who hear her daughter's story to talk about organ donation with their families now. She said making a decision now means one less decision for a family going through a hard time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She advocated for signing up to be an organ donor in college because of a friend with a heart condition, and now she will always be an advocate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It truly is such an incredible way to remember your little one and remember your loved ones and allow them to live on," Barton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

The first dose is recommended at 12 to 15 months of age, with a second dose at 4 to 6 years. Your healthcare  provider can help you determine if early vaccination is appropriate. “Although measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, international travel continues to present a risk. Staying up to date on vaccinations helps protect both individuals and the  broader community,” added Dr. Persse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;HHD is actively monitoring the situation and urges anyone who develops symptoms of measles to contact their healthcare provider before visiting a medical facility to prevent potential exposure to others.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — The Houston Health Department on Sunday confirmed that an infant in the city has been diagnosed with the &lt;a href="/measles"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HHD said the unvaccinated child was exposed to the virus during international travel. The child was hospitalized, but has since been discharged and is recovering at home.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: Video above is from a KHOU 11 question and answer special on measles posted earlier this month&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials emphasized that this case is not related to the &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles/measles-outbreak-texas-2025-update/285-b4558673-e187-4029-b857-b2c2e8d6ac87" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;outbreak in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;, in which there are hundreds of reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to HHD, this is the city's third case of measles in the city in 2025. In January, two other unrelated cases were reported in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent the measles from spreading, Houston health officials encourage vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from the measles is through vaccination," said Houston Chief Medical Officer David Persse. "The MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine is safe, highly effective, and remains the best defense against this potentially severe disease."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to nine out of 10 people who are unvaccinated will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been one measles-related death reported in Texas. The patient was a school-aged child who lived in the outbreak area in the South Plains. The child was not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_embed"&gt;
                                    
                                &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

Shaker cup in hand, a classmate extolled the virtues of the supplement, promising that a tiny scoop of powder taken daily would make us both “superjacked.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The unscientific advice fit into a broader &lt;i&gt;Jersey Shore&lt;/i&gt;-mentality of the time. Creatine was an accessory as vital to the lifestyle as tanning beds or wearing two polo shirts at the same time. Culturally, the supplement is only recently shedding that alignment with bro culture, in part because of changing ideas around body image and muscle mass, but also because of a renewed interest online in the benefits of creatine for both physical and cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Creatine became popular in the early nineties with the discovery that top Olympics athletes were using the supplement at the Barcelona games. Since that time, it’s been called one of the most researched &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2048496/"&gt;supplements in the world&lt;/a&gt;, with more than 500 peer-reviewed publications evaluating its effects on the body according to PubMed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;A 2021 review from the &lt;a href="https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-021-00412-w"&gt;Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; noted that the use of creatine resulted in less muscle damage, inflammation and muscle soreness in response to training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;We’re also starting to see promising research about creatine and cognitive benefits. A 2023 study pointed toward the supplement’s potential in treating memory loss and even Alzheimer’s (though for the latter, human trials are still forthcoming).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Fitting creatine into your daily routine is simple and inexpensive. Here is a breakdown of the supplement and why you may want to try it, even if you don’t regularly go to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is creatine and what does it do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Creatine is a substance we all produce naturally. It’s also found in meat and seafood. Supplementing our natural creatine aides in the recovery process for our muscles, helping to increase mass and strength. Practically, that means lifting heavier things for more reps. A 2019 study from the Journal of Clinical Medicine spoke about how the supplement can also assist in maintaining muscle &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6518405/"&gt;as we age&lt;/a&gt;, decreasing the risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“It’s something that I like to talk about with my clients because it’s an easy benefit toward their goals, whether that’s body composition or just feeling better in their bodies,” said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jeremy.fernandes6/"&gt;Jeremy Fernandes&lt;/a&gt;, a health coach with &lt;a href="https://procoach.app/jeremy-fernandes?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaZPatIm6IbdrWw3iB-L2nRzJ9SZX_yFgHNETEkrihA2iWhgDnWLCDVGcyo_aem_mJyav96s7Ow5MkLW-tkMNA"&gt;Precision Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. “It lets us do more high intensity work and add additional volume to that intensity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;While creatine has definitely improved my workouts, I’ve also found it helpful with concentration and brain fog. A review from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0531556518300263?via%3Dihub"&gt;Experimental Gerontology&lt;/a&gt; touted the supplement’s cognitive benefits, showing improvements in overall memory and potential improvements in brain function during stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“There does seem to be some benefit for memory recall in stressful environments,” Fernandes said. “It’s been shown to be specifically helpful in situations that are highly cognitively stressful, or where sleep deprivation is present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The effects of creatine on women’s health are less studied than its impact on men. But a&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7998865/"&gt; 2021 paper&lt;/a&gt; showed use by premenopausal females was effective for improving strength and exercise performance. Many postmenopausal females also experienced benefits, particularly in relation to skeletal muscle size and function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to use creatine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Most commercial creatine comes in a powder you can add to water, juice or a shake. When starting out the goal is to saturate your muscles; that’s how you’ll start seeing the most benefits. To do that you can “load” by taking 20 grams a day for a week. If you’re fine waiting a little longer to get results, take three to five grams daily for about a month. The maintenance dose after that is also three to five grams daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Compared with many other supplements, it’s affordable. A five-gram dose runs between 35 and 70 cents depending on the brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why does creatine (unfairly) get a bad rap?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Creatine is sometimes conflated with steroids because the supplement has been associated with increased strength and muscle growth. While creatine is effective for gains, it does not produce results anywhere near the rate of testosterone or anabolics. Creatine is also safe to use as long as your kidneys are working fine. The major side effects when starting out are potential gas and bloating, which reduces with use. Most people hesitant to use creatine avoid it because they’re worried about looking bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“The question that comes up often is … ‘Won’t I just gain a bunch of weight, gain a bunch of water or get really bulky?’” says Toronto based trainer and nutrition coach &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/coachmegs.me/"&gt;Megan&lt;/a&gt; Dancey. “But it can aid in attacking our fitness routines a little bit better and get us into an environment where we can then get the results we want.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Dancy has suggested clients use creatine as part of a supplementation routine. When included in a well-rounded plan, it can have huge benefits toward body composition, recovery and mental alertness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“If you’re exploring different supplements to help you in your fitness routine, it hits the top of my list along with protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Globe and Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQYlJYS0tVRVNEemZaZWtFUlJheTV1Tl9oUFJLTXRkS2pvTi1aQkM5eWJsTm50SGpoUi05ZC0zUkhlZHp0WkUyYUN3OWk0NnRuX3BlSEl5N1ZkdXZvMmliRE5NVF9XanA3UjFkbjJJdEMzTFliREdOY0tJS195cklFZmNMQjZCS09Gay1kbTBQWmw3alA3SzU0WTlrb1Z2eGxNa0JVLXJnREhfWnk2Z2Ffbzg2ekFNd2Z1aUZ3</guid></item><item><title>US influencer hospitalized after 'high-protein' carnivore diet leads to this dangerous condition - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carnivore diet, the latest wellness fad of the year, is being enthusiastically tried by weight loss aspirants across all age groups, thanks to its growing popularity among influencers who are vouching for its myriad benefits. Proponents of this eating pattern say it helps them stay alert and energetic. Many claim their skin issues are resolved, courtesy the diet. Considering the diet's high protein appeal, many end up losing pesky pounds, which has added to its followers. Carnivore diet includes meat, poultry, eggs, seafood, fish, and some dairy products. It restricts all vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes, seeds, and nuts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the diet also has a problematic side to it which could land people in trouble. A Dallas-based content creator - Eve Catherine shared her experience in a TikTok video and informed her followers how following carnivore diet landed her in a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video, she shared that she was eating two or three eggs for breakfast, high-protein yogurt for lunch, and a New York strip steak for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first her doctor during her annual check-up noticed high protein levels in her urine. However, she did not think much of it. Soon, she landed in hospital after getting shocker one morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I literally woke up one day and I was peeing straight blood,” the 23-year-old influencer recalled. She admitted that she was once “addicted to protein.” She was then put on morphine at the hospital and passed a kidney stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What went wrong&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What she experienced was due to high protein levels in her body. According to Mayo Clinic, high protein diets can worsen kidney function in people with kidney disease which means the body is not able to filter protein waste products efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single-patient study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition discussed how a patient who followed the diet after coming to know about it from YouTube went through kidney complications. The 68 year-old man lost two-stone while only eating meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests performed a year after revealed the earliest stages of forming the painful crystals. Experts said he was at an elevated risk of all three types of major kidney stones - those formed of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and uric acid, and these were now at 'levels consistent with stone growth'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being convinced by doctors to quit the diet, an examination after one year revealed him to be kidney stone free. Eating foods rich in fibre can help feed good bacteria in the gut, thereby hindering kidney stone formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other risks of high protein diets include constipation, headaches, foul breath, increased risk of heart disease among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After facing the consequences of the diet, The Tiktoker couldn't help but say - “the carnivore diet is so stupid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have warned about the inflammatory nature of carnivore diet and how it could speed up aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t eat too much protein, OK?” Eve Catherine said. “Don’t neglect your fiber intake.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Pictures courtesy: iStock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Correct diet can help safeguard against acute kidney injury: Research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 18:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Another pet food brand recalls cat food for bird flu risk - WKRC TV Cincinnati</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_storyColumn__EZ7G" id="js-Story-Content-0"&gt;&lt;p class="StoryTags-module_tagWrapperLine__Jfav"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI (WKRC) - Another pet food brand has issued a recall for cat food due to possible contamination from bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early March, &lt;a href="https://local12.com/news/nation-world/cat-food-recall-recalls-recalled-over-bird-flu-risk-hpai-h4n1-wild-coast-llc-should-be-discarded-immediately-cincinnati-consumer-dangerous-products-boneless-free-range-chicken-formula-health-risks-transmission-green-label-best-buy-date-raw-public-alert" target="_blank" title="https://local12.com/news/nation-world/cat-food-recall-recalls-recalled-over-bird-flu-risk-hpai-h4n1-wild-coast-llc-should-be-discarded-immediately-cincinnati-consumer-dangerous-products-boneless-free-range-chicken-formula-health-risks-transmission-green-label-best-buy-date-raw-public-alert" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Wild Coast LLC recalled&lt;/a&gt; batches of their raw cat food for possibly leading to bird flu in pets.

&lt;p&gt;A Peruvian tourist in transit was barred from leaving Juan Santamaría International Airport upon arriving in Costa Rica because he lacked a yellow fever vaccination. Minister of Health Mary Munive clarified the policy amid growing confusion. “He planned a day visit to see a friend before flying onward. Transit passengers staying in the airport are exempt, but leaving—for sightseeing or otherwise—requires the vaccine. He was told, ‘Comply or stay,’ and chose to stay,” Munive said. The rule aims to protect Costa Rica, a tropical nation free of yellow fever, from imported cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a similar case, a Paraguayan citizen over 60 arrived to participate in San José’s annual book fair but was denied entry at the counter for lacking a vaccination certificate. “In South America, seniors over 60 are often exempt from the vaccine and don’t receive certificates. Without it, he couldn’t proceed, risking delays,” Munive explained. She noted Costa Rica is refining its rules—mandatory for travelers from Peru, Paraguay, Brazil, and other high-risk nations—amid regional differences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The incidents spotlight a nationwide yellow fever vaccine shortage, worsened by global supply chain disruptions and rising cases in the Americas (14 reported in 2025 by PAHO/WHO). The Costa Rican Association of Travel Agencies (ACAV) and National Chamber of Tourism (&lt;a href="https://canatur.org/"&gt;Canatur&lt;/a&gt;) urged the Ministry to suspend the decree until doses are available. “The shortage makes compliance impossible, threatening travelers and our $4 billion tourism industry,” said Canatur’s Shirley Calvo. On March 11, 2025, the Ministry launched a &lt;a href="https://ticotimes.net/2025/03/10/costa-rica-fights-yellow-fever-with-border-vaccines-and-digital-records" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;border vaccination campaign &lt;/a&gt;and digital certificate system, but full resolution remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Munive stressed adaptability as Costa Rica balances public health and tourism. With thousands of annual visitors from risk zones, clear communication and vaccine access remain critical to avoid further disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89ceu41001b3b724v5utygi@published"&gt;I live next to a nerdy early 30s guy, Kris, and his younger jock boyfriend, Karl. At first, I didn’t think much of them, but over the past few weeks, their relationship has turned into a total soap opera. Karl is this tall, muscular, macho dude. Kris is a great guy, but from what I can overhear, Karl treats him like garbage. They’re constantly arguing, and Karl has started bringing another guy over for loud, obnoxious sex almost every night.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89ceu8x001c3b72qsl1s2fn@published"&gt;I have always considered myself straight. But lately … something’s changed. Hearing them has started to turn me on. I know it’s wrong, and I know I shouldn’t be getting involved, but I can’t stop thinking about it. The idea of Karl hearing &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; with Kris is driving me crazy. I know it’s messed up, but the thought of “cucking” Karl, this super-masculine guy who seems to think he’s untouchable, is weirdly thrilling to me. Kris and I have flirted a few times in the hallway, and I know he likes me. I’m sure he’d be game.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89ceudt001d3b72mbhmi6tu@published"&gt;There’s something about Karl’s arrogant confidence, his total dominance, that’s making me feel things I don’t understand. And the idea of getting one over on him by being with Kris is just … I can’t stop thinking about it. The more I hear them, the more obsessed I become with the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89ceuir001e3b72rc3kxkic@published"&gt;I know I shouldn’t get involved, but the temptation is overwhelming. What should I do? Is this just some weird fantasy I need to get out of my system, or is there something deeper going on here? I’ve never felt this way before, and it’s freaking me out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89ceuxf001h3b72zdch5evo@published"&gt;You’re right, you should not be getting involved. Inserting yourself (literally) into a soap opera will likely only beget more drama. Given the volatility of the Kris-Karl dynamic, and your suspicion that Karl is mistreating Kris, consider a possible outcome of you having sex with Kris: more mistreatment. Even worse, the scenario you envision is one in which Karl &lt;em&gt;hears&lt;/em&gt; you with Kris, which implies at least the possibility that you want to do this without Karl’s knowledge or consent ahead of time. Do you think someone who is already shitty to his boyfriend will take hearing his boyfriend get railed a wall away in stride? It’s possible, but the risks are great.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cev2a001i3b7248ngc4bo@published"&gt;The fact is that you do not know the terms of these dudes’ arrangement. Whether it seems fair or not, they may have a rule where only Karl gets to have outside sex. They may both need to be present. Maybe Kris isn’t allowed to bottom for anyone besides Karl. You would have to navigate the terms of their openness (if they are in fact open, which seems likely but is also unclear) with both of them in order for this to be ethical. You can’t cuck Karl without Karl’s consent, and if he is into it then you’d kind of be doing him a favor no matter how much you tear into Kris.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cev7a001j3b72yn2xb6ey@published"&gt;I say let this Kris-Karl cuck concept exist as a fantasy. If you’re curious about guys for real, there are plenty of gay couples who would gladly have a straight dude over to plow one or both of them. Go on a hook-up app, label yourself as a straight guy who wants to cuck a gay couple and watch the requests pour in.&lt;/p&gt;

One morning last week, I cut my hand while doing dishes at my girlfriend’s house. It was a small cut, so I called her while she was at work to ask if she had some Band-Aids. She told me they were in the bottom left side drawer of the bathroom vanity. There, on top of the box of Band-Aids, was a tube of vaginal itch cream (Vagisil). I put it back and checked the next day when getting another Band-Aid, and the tube had been turned. I checked the next day and it had been moved again. Same thing the following day. It seemed like she was using it on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszr00283b72diejt7ba@published"&gt;This wouldn’t normally be a concern, but after going for years without a case of jock itch, I have had two recent cases. A prescription from my doctor cleared it up, but it got me thinking: Am I “catching” something from her? We are exclusive, so we no longer use condoms. Should I be concerned about catching (I couldn’t think of a better term) something more serious? Is there reason to be alarmed she uses this stuff everyday? If there is a concern, how do I bring it up to her?&lt;/p&gt;

Jock itch is caused by a fungus (tinea cruris). &lt;a href="https://www.vagisil.com/product/regular-strength-anti-itch-creme"&gt;Vagisil, in its original-recipe form&lt;/a&gt;, is not an antifungal medication. Its main active ingredient is benzocaine, an anesthetic. If your girlfriend has jock itch, Vagisil may alleviate the pain, but it won’t clear it up. However, Vagisil does make &lt;a href="https://www.vagisil.com/products/yeast-infection-treatment"&gt;a line of yeast-infection treatments&lt;/a&gt; that contain miconazole nitrate, an antifungal that &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618061.html"&gt;used to treat jock itch&lt;/a&gt; as well. (The fungus that causes yeast infections is Candida, typically Candida albicans. It can also itch and may result in a cottage cheese-like discharge.) My guess is that she’s using the plain, old anti-itch version to alleviate her pain without actually getting rid of the fungus. So the fungus persists and so does pain, which leads to further Vagisil use.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszs002c3b72a8z6hcza@published"&gt;So yes, the jock itch may have been transmitted from her to you. But, as you can see, this is something that is cleared up easily. I think it’s quite reasonable to tell your girlfriend, “Look, I had jock itch twice and I noticed that you have been using Vagisil. Do you think maybe you have jock itch, too?” If she isn’t already using an antifungal, then giving her this heads up will help mitigate her pain and allow her body to recover. As her boyfriend, you should be so helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszs002d3b72inaz3hzz@published"&gt;Should you be concerned about something more serious? I mean, not based on the fact that your girlfriend may have jock itch alone, but sure, transmission is a possibility with partners. Viruses like HPV and herpes may be dormant or totally asymptomatic. When you’re having sex with someone, there’s always the risk of bacterial infections like syphilis and gonorrhea as well. Even in theoretically monogamous arrangements, sometimes people cheat, which can lead to infection risk. Trust is going to be key here, but I really don’t think a persistent case of jock itch is a good cause to become distrustful. Truly not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002f3b725xuji8kk@published"&gt;I’m a 31-year-old gay man who was recently diagnosed with HSV-1: genital herpes caused by the cold sore virus. I honestly had no idea that you could get genital herpes by receiving oral sex from someone who has ever had a cold sore on their mouth (even if they don’t have one when you hook up).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002g3b72uk0mo97g@published"&gt;My doctor told me that I don’t need to “walk around with a red H on my chest” and said that he does not think it’s necessary to tell sexual partners that I have HSV-1. He said that the risk of transmission is very low without symptoms, and that I just got very unlucky.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002h3b72p8jqnn4a@published"&gt;However, I feel uncomfortable with the idea of not telling someone about this, because there is technically a small risk of transmission. Unlike with HIV, you can’t take medication to prevent getting herpes, and taking herpes antivirals cannot suppress the virus to undetectable levels.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002i3b72k2p3p58y@published"&gt;I was recently chatting with a guy on Scruff for a couple days. Once the conversation turned towards meeting up, I told him that I had GHSV-1, that the risk of transmission was very low but not zero, and to feel free to read about it and let me know if he had any questions. He flipped out at me and said I wasted his time, and blocked me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002j3b72e42b9r2q@published"&gt;I feel pretty down after this experience. Most people already have HSV-1 and have antibodies to it. But I feel like the stigma is too great to not tell this to sexual partners. At the same time, I sincerely doubt that anyone with cold sores on their mouth is telling sexual partners they could give them genital herpes. So, am I just making this way harder on myself than I need to by being honest?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="188" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002m3b72vbnk1mll@published"&gt;There is no real easy answer to this, as your letter suggests. If you think about the man-on-man hook-up app ecosystem, it is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; rare for people to disclose any kind of herpes upfront, by which I mean in their profiles. It’s probably a bit more common in private chats, but still unusual, at least in my anecdotal experience. I can think of one or two guys who have mentioned it, out of what must be thousands that I’ve talked to through the years. It’s not like HIV in that respect, where there are plenty of guys who note their status in their profiles. Also, while inconvenient, sometimes painful, and occasionally responsible for complications, herpes is nowhere nearly as serious as HIV. You’re right, valacyclovir isn’t a magic bullet (though it does &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14702423/"&gt;significantly reduce the risk of transmission&lt;/a&gt;), but a key difference here is that if you don’t take herpes antiretrovirals, herpes in all likelihood isn’t going to kill you. The same cannot be said for HIV in the vast majority of cases. Herpes stigma is high, but its actual stakes on quality of life are much lower.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="189" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszt002n3b72xtsgqt41@published"&gt;Given the cultural vibe, you are putting yourself at a disadvantage by being honest (no one said that being ethical is easy!) You say it yourself in your letter: You feel uncomfortable with the idea of not telling someone about your herpes. And so, you should do what you think is right. For a lot of guys, the risk of contracting herpes is implicit and that’s why they don’t talk about it. Group/public sex is a major feature of modern urban gay culture, and in the age of PrEP, this activity is often done without physical barriers like condoms. I’ve never been to a sex party where I’ve heard the guys discussing their HSV or HPV status. It is assumed that possible contraction of these viruses, if it hasn’t happened already, goes with the territory. That doesn’t mean you need to fall into lockstep with the prevailing laissez faire attitudes of gay hook-up culture. You can be different and disclose and shoulder the rejection that may come with it. I bet you’ll encounter guys, unlike your Scruff near miss, who don’t care and will hook up with you anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm89cfszu002o3b72g83nne3b@published"&gt;Just one thing to keep in mind, though: According to herpes expert Anna Wald, a doctor and professor of medicine and epidemiology at University of Washington School of Medicine, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/05/boyfriend-girlfriend-third-rules-relationship-questions.html"&gt;whom I have interviewed before for this column&lt;/a&gt;, “Transmission from genital HSV-1 is unusual, because genital HSV-1 does not reactivate very often.” So you’d be disclosing a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; slight amount of risk. If that helps you sleep at night, though, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;

Another cat linked to Savage was diagnosed last month with H5N1, the medical designation for the disease, and had similar symptoms. A third city cat also linked to Savage products likely had bird flu but survived and it’s now too late to test for the infection, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savage co-founder Audrey Brady said the company was notified of the issue in February. In a statement she said “we are incredibly saddened” by the deaths and added the company issued a recall notice on February 17 after a customer in Colorado reported their cat had fallen ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The product in question was then sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa for virus isolation testing,” she said. “As a precautionary measure for our consumers, we initiated a market withdrawal while awaiting final test results.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company and city officials said the poultry in question was part of a specific lot, code 11152026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the current outbreak, bird flu has been detected in 48 flocks of birds across New York state. &lt;a href="https://agriculture.ny.gov/animals/poultry" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Seven of those detections&lt;/a&gt; occurred in live &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/why-does-new-york-city-have-around-70-live-animal-markets" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;poultry markets&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island in March alone, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those infections were reported after &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/gov-hochul-shutters-nyc-downstate-live-bird-markets-due-to-avian-flu" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul ordered&lt;/a&gt; several live poultry markets in New York City to shut down temporarily last month, following several previous detections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City officials urged pet owners to keep cats indoors and to steer dogs clear of any dead animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Caroline Lewis contributed reporting. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 15:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQbHIyTmNkR25rVW1ZM0xHT0JMb2YxNUhua0hra2EzWXd6UEZuNUJrOS13eDk1MEVtemdaaVQxSDFSMEFNVVlFanM4Q3RWMnZNNmRBckRONXFVa1FtekJLWDZPb1NUbWNvcHlNc2ZNcjhKUnlJeHBRbk5oak9GOVk5WE5NZklnNTIwUWdOU0ZkZUdsb2pEdU84a25HaFdfUGRpSUlUSVR3UWtIaTA</guid></item><item><title>Flu cases are finally dropping in NY amid particularly nasty season - Gothamist</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNVlgtaU80UzgyMEtwOFJ3T1ZtSlRyTTdmelVJekwwVnM2c25uYjgweUkwQUdkNkhKRlhKTmk1dk9xamFWQno3M3cyOGdvZkhUQkEtOVh4aDFaSU5XUEpBRVBSN2FFckxaQ3loeGZJOGJSUWdydmllbHdaT09VUmZXUmNnM3JzTEJoblIzR0Q1OFpfWkRwZXFsQmpB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu season finally appears to be on its way out as cases begin to drop in New York, but it’s been a particularly nasty season and it’s unclear when exactly it will end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York is not alone. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorized the 2024-25 season as the first “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-08.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;high-severity&lt;/a&gt;” flu season in seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the week ending March 1, New York labs ran more than 50,000 flu tests and &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/influenza/surveillance/2024-2025/flu_report_current_week.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;44% came back positive&lt;/a&gt;, a 25% decrease from the previous week, according to state Department of Health data. During the same week, 1,442 patients were also hospitalized for the flu, which represented a 23% drop from the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the share of flu tests coming back positive at the beginning of March was still higher than at the same time last year, and the &lt;a href="https://nyshc.health.ny.gov/web/nyapd/new-york-state-flu-tracker" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;number of cases and hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt; has been up this season overall, according to the state data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The funny thing about flu is that it's different every year,” said Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “ Usually, it does correspond to holidays and travel, but then sometimes we'll see the flu come up in a peak, go down, and then there'll be another, usually smaller peak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morse noted that the flu has rebounded after cases dropped off during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic because people are no longer taking strict precautions around masking and social distancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York’s flu season started in mid-October this year and peaked at the end of January, with 54,737 cases in one week. The 2022-2023 flu season’s November peak came close to that figure, but state data shows cases dropped off more quickly than they have this time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/why-flu-bad-2025-severity-vaccines-immunity-rcna194250" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Some public health experts say&lt;/a&gt; the current strains that are circulating may be to blame for the severity of this year's flu season, since they tend to spread more quickly and cause more severe symptoms than strains in prior years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ravi Saksena, a pediatrician at South Slope Pediatrics, said at the height of this year’s flu season in January, “ we were surprised when [patients] weren't positive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the most important precaution to take to prevent infection is getting a flu shot at the beginning of the season. Although flu vaccines are not 100% effective, “ the shot really helps make sure that the illness is not as prolonged and not as bad,” Saksena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm#:~:text=Effectiveness%20against%20influenza%20A(H3N2,%2C%20U.S.%20Flu%20VE%20network)." rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;flu vaccines&lt;/a&gt; were 32% to 60% effective at preventing people under 18 from getting the flu and 63% to 78% effective at preventing hospitalization, according to data from the CDC. But only about &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-and-influenza-vaccination-data" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;27% of New Yorkers&lt;/a&gt; got their flu shots this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saksena said the range of symptoms associated with the flu can vary depending on which strain a patient catches. Symptoms typically include fever, fatigue, body aches, runny nose and sore throat, but can also come with problems such as nausea or vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antiviral medications for flu are optional, Saksena said. The CDC says they can be beneficial for those who are more vulnerable, including children under 2, adults over 65 and patients with asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 15:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNVlgtaU80UzgyMEtwOFJ3T1ZtSlRyTTdmelVJekwwVnM2c25uYjgweUkwQUdkNkhKRlhKTmk1dk9xamFWQno3M3cyOGdvZkhUQkEtOVh4aDFaSU5XUEpBRVBSN2FFckxaQ3loeGZJOGJSUWdydmllbHdaT09VUmZXUmNnM3JzTEJoblIzR0Q1OFpfWkRwZXFsQmpB</guid></item></channel></rss>
