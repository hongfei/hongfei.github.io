&lt;p&gt;Of the 308 who benefited from tirzepatide, 254 (82 percent) regained at least 25 percent of the weight they had lost on the drug by week 88. Further, 177 (57 percent) regained at least 50 percent, and 74 (24 percent) regained at least 75 percent. Generally, the more weight people regained, the more their cardiovascular and metabolic health improvements reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data gaps and potential off-ramps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there were 54 participants of the 308 (17.5 percent) that didn’t regain a significant amount of weight (less than 25 percent.) This group saw some of their health metrics worsen on withdrawal of the drug, but not all— blood pressure increased a bit, but cholesterol didn’t go up significantly overall. About a dozen participants (4 percent of the 308) continued to lose weight after stopping the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers couldn’t figure out why these 54 participants fared so well; there were “no apparent differences” in demographic or clinical characteristics, they reported. It’s clear the topic requires further study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, overall, the study offers a gloomy outlook for patients hoping to avoid needing to take anti-obesity drugs for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oczypok and Anderson highlight that the study involved an abrupt withdrawal from the drug. In contrast, many patients may be interested in slowly weaning off the drugs, stepping down dosage levels over time. So far, data on this strategy and the protocols to pull it off have little data behind them. It also might not be an option for patients who abruptly lose access or insurance coverage of the drugs. Other strategies for weaning off the drugs could involve ramping up physical activity or calorie restriction in anticipation of dropping the drugs, the experts note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to more data on potential GLP-1 off-ramps, the pair calls for more data on the effects of weight fluctuations from people going on and off the treatment. At least one study has found that the regained weight after intentional weight loss may end up being proportionally higher in fat mass, which could be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Oczypok and Anderson say doctors should be cautious about talking with patients about these drugs and what the future could hold. “These results add to the body of evidence that clinicians and patients should approach starting [anti-obesity medications] as long-term therapies, just as they would medications for other chronic diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;

As second in command, Abraham would be in a position to act as a key adviser on a variety of public health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8e988" class="body-graf"&gt;A three-term Louisiana congressman, Abraham practiced for 10 years as a veterinarian before going to medical school. According to his &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/assets/docs/Secretary/OfficialDocs/Official-Bio_Ralph-Abraham.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;biography on the Louisiana Department of Health website&lt;/a&gt;, Abraham was a “practicing family medicine physician” when he was appointed as state surgeon general in 2024. He described himself as a “&lt;a href="https://pro.stateaffairs.com/la/health-care/ralph-abraham-maha-robert-kennedy-jeff-landry" target="_blank"&gt;country doctor&lt;/a&gt;” in an essay published in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-82eac5" class="body-graf"&gt;While Abraham is licensed to practice medicine in Louisiana, the &lt;a href="https://lailluminator.com/2025/02/18/abraham-board/" target="_blank"&gt;Louisiana Illustrator reported&lt;/a&gt; in February that he did not appear to be board-certified in the specialty of family medicine. A search for Abraham on the &lt;a href="https://portfolio.theabfm.org/diplomate/find.aspx?ts=638996677" target="_blank"&gt;American Board of Family Medicine’s website&lt;/a&gt; yielded no results. A separate search on the &lt;a href="https://online.lasbme.org/#/verifylicense" target="_blank"&gt;Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiner’s site&lt;/a&gt; lists Abraham as a general practitioner but not a family medicine doctor. (Board certification isn’t required to practice any particular specialty, but it’s viewed as an extra layer to ensure a doctor’s credentials, experience and expertise, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.abpsus.org/physician-board-certified-specialties/" target="_blank"&gt;American Board of Physician Specialties&lt;/a&gt;.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-597546" class="body-graf"&gt;Abraham’s new position makes him the most senior scientist at CDC. The current acting director, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/separate-measles-mumps-rubella-vaccine-acting-cdc-director-rcna235971" target="_blank"&gt;Jim O’Neill, is not a medical doctor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2c2a62" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Richard Besser, who served as an acting director of the CDC in 2009 under the Obama administration, said he is “greatly concerned” that Abraham’s appointment will serve as an extension of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s well-established distrust of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-12c622" class="body-graf"&gt;“Dr. Abraham, rather than being someone who will push back on that, I think, will further the Secretary’s agenda,” said Besser, a pediatrician and president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said. “I would expect that Dr. Abraham will have a lot of authority over what takes place within the agency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8e3d8" class="body-graf"&gt;Abraham has been vocal in his opposition of Covid vaccines. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/louisiana-surgeon-general-says-covid-160350442.html" target="_blank"&gt;he told the Shreveport Times&lt;/a&gt; that he “sees Covid vaccine injuries every day.” There was no explanation of the kind of injuries he was referring to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9e105c" class="body-graf"&gt;In February, The &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/louisiana-vaccination-surgeon-general-8e2eecde047648e6fb62c4b44edd6566" target="_blank"&gt;Associated Press reported&lt;/a&gt; that Abraham directed the Louisiana Department of Health, in an internal memo, to “no longer promote mass vaccination” through media campaigns like those for flu shots typically seen at the beginning of the winter respiratory virus season. The AP obtained the memo signed by Abraham. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a54cd1" class="body-graf"&gt;Abraham’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2b3f3c" class="body-graf"&gt;While flu activity is low so far this season, according to the&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-46.html" target="_blank"&gt; CDC’s latest flu report&lt;/a&gt;, Louisiana is reporting the highest levels of flu-like illnesses in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c076ad" class="body-graf"&gt;In the past year, with Abraham at the helm, the state’s Department of Health waited several months after two babies died of whooping cough before&lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center-CP/HANs/2025/HAN-25_2-Statewide-Increase-in-Pertussis-Cases.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; formally alerting the public&lt;/a&gt; about a rise in cases across the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1def2b" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/la_surgeon/status/1990813242055114835" target="_blank"&gt;On X&lt;/a&gt;, Abraham &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-acetaminophen-fda-pregnancy-autism-cause-rcna232909" target="_blank"&gt;touted a drug called leucovorin&lt;/a&gt; as a promising treatment for some children with autism. There is limited evidence that it could help a small number of children, but large studies suggesting broad benefits are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-365cee" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;As a Republican candidate for governor for Louisiana in 2019, Abraham released&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/louisiana-governor-s-race-ad-takes-aim-transgender-rights-n1045176" target="_blank"&gt; TV ads taking aim at abortion rights&lt;/a&gt; and the transgender community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;div class="expanded-byline-contributors articleBylineContainer"&gt;&lt;div class="expanded-byline article-expanded-byline" data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"&gt;&lt;div class="expanded-byline__bio-wrapper expanded-byline__bio "&gt;&lt;p class="byline-bio expanded-byline__bio "&gt;Erika Edwards is a health and medical news writer and reporter for NBC News and "TODAY."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="expanded-contributors"&gt;Pilar Melendez contributed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 20:24:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPZjZKdjIwYjR2Y2JabFdoREtLQV9wc0NXaUFoTHc0QjByX0lnSldnOFZ0WVVVUXM4S0wwNlY5UERQTFhjR0dydHRaWEhGaEEwZVk2clYxUjdOV09qcWwzNXN4dzQzWTZ1bGdabzI0TF9oX2hSV2I2M2dfQ0l4SmMycURLR1BvWnBPTjZJbVFvYUxjallpZ0s2RWlOSUNoWXdtUnhxUGZxWGROcW0yRXJSZzVyLWlZOEJ6YnBFN9IBVkFVX3lxTE9QQm9YbDlocGtCenZLR0czQ0R4QkFIQWJ5SUhraTBjLXBYaXRoQWNsc01zUWRmSHNfOURhSzhENXd5TVpqZHBlRWpDNi1uUGVuS2ptNkpR</guid></item><item><title>关于致命的大麻呕吐综合征- Axios的须知事项</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/11/25/cannabis-hyperemesis-syndrome-thc-symptoms-use</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 20:20:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQbllaQkp5VWowQ2VjSmJPSDg0MUtsSlZ0MWt6czZva2paelFDTllIdDk4T1RUQjhvRGdjalRvNG12NldISUk2SUZMZ0h0Y0cybllKREpsM01fY1N4STByTjV3b0xVeGViZ1FqVWc4TjZscHpRSFlGcGdROVZwaXRwSGUxaDVodw</guid></item><item><title>胆固醇不仅仅是“好”或“坏” --《经济学人》</title><link>https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2025/11/25/theres-more-to-cholesterol-than-simply-good-or-bad</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economist</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:50:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxPVVd4QlFjMkZVZ3F3bVF4S0hLUkZqZVhRaFNUMDBxSXkxd1U4cEJnUFNZWTBJaTFLSHFsYUxpbTlrY2djWEZPYzczRFJwTjY2cHFVSUdvcEJDQVVhSFowcU1VdVVzZTM3OFJjSmRQX0xtNUllazhJNEpFNFljNDNpT1lJaGR2M09HZTVuZ3ZGSmExbUdBd2g5dnRJdkdRU3NyWTBDZWRidm54b2ozMXpn</guid></item><item><title>让感恩节美食成为“蓝色区域”的5种方法- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/25/health/blue-zone-thanksgiving-recipe-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;(CNN) —&lt;/strong&gt; The food people consume has long been understood to shape them in some way.

            “Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are,” French gourmand Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin famously wrote in 1826.

            How you choose to nourish yourself plays a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/13/health/ultraprocessed-foods-colorectal-cancer-risk-wellness"&gt;large role in health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/09/health/live-longer-diet-wellness"&gt;even longevity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-death-wellness"&gt;modern-day studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown.

            National Geographic fellow and best-selling author Dan Buettner knows this as well as anyone, and he has tips you can use — even for holiday feasts﻿. For two decades, he has been studying “blue zones,” places around the globe where people live the longest and healthiest lives. Diet is one of the major reasons why these folks have an edge.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieom9mm000k3b6ndfkbk13z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/29/health/longevity-blue-zone-meals-wellness"&gt;People in blue zones&lt;/a&gt;, including Okinawa, Japan, and the island of Sardinia in Italy, eat plant-based diets that prioritize whole foods. “These simple peasant foods taste maniacally delicious,” Buettner told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life. “That’s the word I like to use.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieom9mm000l3b6nxca2vat1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Buettner’s latest cookbook, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Zones-Kitchen-One-Meals/dp/1426224125/" target="_blank"&gt;The Blue Zones Kitchen One Pot Meals&lt;/a&gt;: 100 Recipes to Live to 100,” puts a spin on the healthy ingredients people use in these far-flung places so that they&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;appeal to the American palate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieom9mm000m3b6nlvxol83p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Buettner collaborated with &lt;a href="https://jeichstaedt.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Johannes Eichstaedt&lt;/a&gt;, who directs Stanford University’s Computational Psychology and Well-Being Lab, using artificial intelligence to analyze 675,000 recipes from popular websites including Food Network and Allrecipes.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“We found that most of the most popular recipes in America followed one of seven different patterns,” Buettner explained. “And then we kind of reverse engineered deliciousness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieom9mm000o3b6np4fm3ak3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, the recipes have other virtues to overcome common concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieom9mm000p3b6npx22i4bs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you have the competition from fast food and processed food, one of the biggest objections you’re going to get is, ‘I don’t have time. No. 2, ‘I can’t afford it.’ No. 3, ‘I don’t know how to do it.’ No. 4, ‘I don’t think it’ll be delicious,’” he explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To develop a cookbook of one-pot recipes, Buettner said, “I started with these criteria: that every recipe had to take less than 20 minutes to combine, it had to cost less than three bucks a serving, and it had to be maniacally delicious.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieoqati000y3b6n4bt9rvgh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thanksgiving apparently did not get the longevity-promoting memo, since many of the dishes Americans typically love to devour during the feast are a few sticks of butter in excess of being health-promoting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieor2gy00133b6n5u4pbucv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that doesn’t mean you have to toss the turkey out with the gravy. Small tweaks can help you align your holiday meal with blue-zone eating patterns. Here are Buettner’s five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieor2gy00143b6npl29y98k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.bluezones.com/2022/11/the-true-first-thanksgiving/" target="_blank"&gt;original Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt; staples — beans, corn and squash — are also three of the most longevity-boosting foods on the planet, Buettner said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieor2gy00153b6n7a1iputd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He noted that versions of this nutrient-packed trio are not just part of traditional Native American diets, but also those of people living in the blue zones  of Costa Rica’s Nicoya region and the island of Icaria in Greece.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieor2gy00163b6n4s51f03h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Build your menu around these, and you’re already eating like centenarians.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieot7px001e3b6ntfu7s341@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Add a longevity-boosting salad or vegetable-forward side dish (or two) to the feast, Buettner suggested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieot7px001f3b6nba7z93x8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Blue-zone tables are full of leafy greens: mustard greens, collards, wild arugula, fennel fronds,” he said. “A simple, herb-heavy salad or roasted seasonal vegetables can lighten a traditionally heavy meal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieot7px001g3b6nodx7ojil@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s a side dish recipe from “One Pot Meals” to try:
    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            In a ramekin or small bowl, whisk together the glaze ingredients until the honey is dissolved, then set aside.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Cut the carrots lengthwise in half or quarters so that the widest ends are about ¼ inch thick.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.3.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Toss the carrots in the oil to coat evenly, then add the salt and spices and toss again.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.4.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Spread the carrots in a single layer on a13-x-9-inch sheet pan, with curved sides facing up.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.5.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Roast the carrots for 30 minutes, then remove the pan from the oven. Drizzle the glaze over the carrots, and return to the oven for 5 more minutes.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.6.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Garnish with the chopped greens before serving.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            In accompaniments calling for refined grains, swap in whole-grain alternatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Instead of white rolls or refined stuffing, try whole-grain sourdough, barley or wild rice,” Buettner said. “These keep blood sugar stable and keep you fuller with fewer calories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Even if you go with your favorites, you can tweak them to be healthier, as Buettner does in his take on whipped potatoes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Trim any dark spots off the potatoes, then halve or quarter the potatoes so all the pieces are roughly the same size, about 2 inches across.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;

            Put the potatoes in a deep pot that’s large enough to hold them with plenty of room to spare.

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;

        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Bring the water to a boil and cook until a knife can pierce the potatoes with minimal resistance, about 20 minutes.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.4.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;

      &lt;li data-editable="items.5.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        &lt;span class="list__text"&gt;
            Add the oil, salt and chives and use an immersion blender to whip it all into a smooth, velvety puree.
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.6.text" class="list__item vossi-list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;

            Instead of piling up your plate with every dessert on offer, try to reframe the way you think about the course.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieovqwc002d3b6ni9s801m1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You don’t need to ban dessert, just change the equation,” Buettner said. “In Sardinia, people enjoy a single simple sweet after meals, not an avalanche of pies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieovqwc002e3b6nio0wjrm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another option: Try naturally sweet foods like baked apples, roasted squash or dates, he suggested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmieovqwc002f3b6nzcgn88bz@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="strengthen-ties-with-family-and-friends" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Strengthen ties with family and friends
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieovqwc002g3b6ngmgd0mq6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Make the holiday social, active and purposeful. “A blue-zone Thanksgiving doesn’t end at the table,” Buettner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieovqwc002h3b6n1of245hu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nor does it start there. “Play a game, ask everyone to share a gratitude story or include elders in the cooking,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieovqwc002i3b6nl7tf2s8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And, post-meal, head outside for a stroll, not to the couch — at least not right away!
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmieovqwc002j3b6nqukqy1ij@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Longevity isn’t just about what’s on the plate,” he said. “It’s the whole web of connection around it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Even after accounting for factors like age, obesity, and cardiovascular conditions, those who did not use CPAP were nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with Parkinson’s as those who treated their apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight how repeated nighttime drops in oxygen may heighten long-term vulnerability of the brain’s neural circuits. Researchers say the results underscore the importance of sleep-quality interventions as a potential buffer against neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Untreated sleep apnea nearly doubled long-term Parkinson’s risk compared to treated apnea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective CPAP:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular CPAP use significantly reduced the likelihood of developing Parkinson’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxygen Stress:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic oxygen disruption during sleep may predispose neurons to degeneration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Oregon Health and Science University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research reveals that people with untreated obstructive sleep apnea have a higher risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. However, they can significantly reduce the risk by improving the quality of their sleep by using continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;, examined electronic health records covering more than 11 million U.S. military veterans who received care through the Department of Veterans Affairs between 1999 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University and the Portland VA Health Care System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s is a neurodegenerative condition that affects an estimated 1 million people nationwide, with the risk rising incrementally year by year for people over age 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study suggests a heightened risk of people with untreated sleep apnea developing Parkinson’s over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting to rule out confounding factors like obesity, age and high blood pressure, the study found a strong link between untreated sleep apnea and Parkinson’s. Among millions of people with sleep apnea, those who didn’t treat the condition with CPAP were nearly twice as likely to have Parkinson’s as those who did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not at all a guarantee that you’re going to get Parkinson’s, but it significantly increases the chances,” said co-author Gregory Scott, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of pathology in the OHSU School of Medicine and a pathologist for at the VA Portland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea is a common condition where an individual’s breathing stops and restarts many times during sleep, which can prevent the body from getting enough oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you stop breathing and oxygen is not at a normal level, your neurons are probably not functioning at a normal level either,” said lead author Lee Neilson, M.D., assistant professor of neurology at OHSU and a staff neurologist at the Portland VA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Add that up night after night, year after year, and it may explain why fixing the problem by using CPAP may build in some resilience against neurodegenerative conditions, including Parkinson’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neilson said he intends to prioritize the health benefits of sound sleep with his patients, especially in view of the research revealing an elevated risk of Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it will change my practice,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott noted that even though some people with sleep apnea resist treatment with CPAP, he pointed to the experience of many veterans who swear by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The veterans who use their CPAP love it,” he said. “They’re telling other people about it. They feel better, they’re less tired. Perhaps if others know about this reduction in risk of Parkinson’s disease, it will further convince peopel with sleep apnea to give CPAP a try.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Scott and Neilson, co-authors include Isabella Montano, B.A., Jasmin May, M.D., Ph.D., Jonathan Elliott, Ph.D., and Miranda Lim, M.D., Ph.D., of OHSU and the Portland VA Health Care System; and Yeilim Cho, M.D., and Jeffrey Iliff, Ph.D., of the University of Washington and the VA Puget Sound Health Care System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by the VA, grant awards BX005760, CX00253, I01RX004822, I01RX005371, CX002022, BX006155 and Bx006155; the John and Tami Marick Family Foundation, the Collins Medical Trust; the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health, award P30AG066518; and the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, 820 Chandler Street, Fort Detrick, Maryland 21702-5014, under award numbers HT9425-24-1-0774 and HT9425-24-1-0775.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opinions, interpretations, conclusions and recommendations are those of the authors and are not necessarily endorsed by the Department of Defense, the NIH, VA or other funders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764027334040"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Does untreated sleep apnea raise the risk of Parkinson’s disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Yes, people with untreated sleep apnea were nearly twice as likely to develop Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764027336097"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Can CPAP therapy lower this Parkinson’s risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Yes, consistent CPAP use significantly reduced Parkinson’s risk in long-term data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764027335896"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why might sleep apnea contribute to neurodegeneration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Chronic oxygen disruption may harm neurons over years, increasing vulnerability to disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep apnea and Parkinson’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7c0e131e1512190e153c13140f0952191809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Erik Robinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ohsu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oregon Health and Science University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Erik Robinson – Oregon Health and Science University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2025.4691" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Positive Airway Pressure, and Implications of Early Treatment in Parkinson Disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Gregory Scott et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Positive Airway Pressure, and Implications of Early Treatment in Parkinson Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with many health conditions, including dementia and early mortality. Prior epidemiological studies linking OSA with Parkinson disease (PD) are conflicting, and no studies have examined the influence of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the criterion standard treatment for OSA, on PD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine the association between OSA with incident Parkinson disease among US veterans and risk modification by CPAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This electronic health record (EHR)–based cohort study was conducted among US veterans from January 1, 1999, to December 30, 2022, with mean (SD) follow-up of 4.9 (1.8) years. Veterans with PD at the time of exposure or incomplete records were excluded. Data analysis was completed from September 2024 to September 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposure&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OSA was defined by its appropriate administrative code; CPAP usage was extracted from a semistructured medical interview field in the EHR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary outcome, cumulative incidence of PD, was calculated adjusting for competing risk of death after balancing for age, race, sex, and smoking status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 13 737 081 US veterans were screened, and 11 310 411 veterans (1 109 543 female veterans [9.8%]) with mean (SD) age of 60.5 (14.7) years were included in analyses. Of included veterans, 1 552 505 (13.7%) had OSA. Veterans with OSA demonstrated 1.61 additional cases of PD (point estimate; 95% CI, 1.13-2.09) at 6 years from diagnosis per 1000 people compared to those without OSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results were confirmed when adjusting for body mass index, vascular comorbidities, psychiatric conditions, and relevant medications and were of greater magnitude in female veterans. Case numbers were significantly reduced when treated with CPAP early in the disease course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this EHR-based cohort study, OSA appeared to be an independent risk factor for the later development of PD and could be modified by early treatment with CPAP. Effective screening measures and protocols for consistent adherence to CPAP may have large impacts on brain health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:58:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE9wUV91M0xIeU5lYi1mektoaWVERXh4RDVwSTlGN2E3LWpSZzBDTl9BNndjT1owdVlCT09KT3lzYUNiYVY0WFJndUJxbF9Tbjd3THFPc3Fabm91dE9yZFdBbFlYOXBnb202c21WeQ</guid></item><item><title>在40多岁的时候挣扎？对于许多女性来说，这是围绝经期-黎明</title><link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1957297</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Dawn</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:48:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiSEFVX3lxTFB6OThtajlzRUlISHFFbXpQU290V3p2WUx1cjVZakZTQkpSVVpHcE5PSklEdkllcWhrMERuLTdUeHpUcXJQT0dGNdIBTkFVX3lxTE16ejBFRFpYamdpU3lxM25Ub2ZNMUJiaHJaY2kwN2phNC05M1dsQXJEdFFOMWNCRGtvaVlOTk1NS295RTRxRThfbFBfanRidw</guid></item><item><title>以下是大餐如何影响您的心脏-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/11/25/big-meal-heart-attack/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3F7BK6HQNBDN7NNZDUCTVNSBKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Is it true that eating a big meal can lead to a heart attack?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:32:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE42RTZtUERyRHE0N0FOUTg3cjYxRlFMc2xEMjB4TE05bGlFUGQ0cllrTEowQVo5bkV4cmhTVGYzNE9VNDJscW9XbVRRNHF0RVQxMzY3OGJURXB1dkZkYVRDNHB0OFJ1aXJENzBITFdmVVZYY2JfSVdFQnI4UFFWdw</guid></item><item><title>在犹他州的这所学校发现5例麻疹病例后，官员们给家长们留了2条信息--《盐湖论坛报》</title><link>https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2025/11/26/utah-health-officials-urge-2/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-head"&gt;&lt;h1 class="headline"&gt;After 5 measles cases were linked to this Utah school, officials have 2 messages for parents&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-subheadline"&gt;The school sits in a county with some of the lowest measles vaccination rates among Utah public school kids, state health data indicates.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="image-rootLeft"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1ez1ofp"&gt;&lt;span class=" lazy-load-image-background "&gt;&lt;span class="image-img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption-credit"&gt;(Grace Doerfler | KPCW) Wasatch High School, where five cases of measles were linked last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="f0fvPICkDdVr4HR" data-fusion-collection="features" data-fusion-type="article-byline/default" data-fusion-name="Article Byline v2 New" data-fusion-message="Could not render component [features:article-byline/default]"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f0fSQqI7MjYN5RL" data-fusion-collection="features" data-fusion-type="article-group-buttons/default" data-fusion-name="Article Group Icons" data-fusion-message="Could not render component [features:article-group-buttons/default]"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-container" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note to readers •&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Salt Lake Tribune is making this story free to all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;After five measles cases were linked to one Utah high school last week, state health officials are urging two things of campus parents: Keep unvaccinated children at home, and vaccinate your kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The school, Wasatch High, sits in a county with some of the lowest measles vaccination rates among public school kids in the state, according to &lt;a href="https://immunize-training.at.utah.gov/captivate/UtahSchoolsData_7thGrd_UpdatedApr2025.html#IP%20exemptions" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Utah Department of Health and Human Services data.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;According to 2024-25 school year data, for instance, 13% of seventh graders in Wasatch County lacked documentation showing they had received the two-dose measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The guidance for Wasatch High families came in&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a joint letter Saturday from the Wasatch County School District and the Wasatch County Health Department that disclosed the exposures, which “may” have occurred between Nov. 14 and Nov. 18. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“Measles is highly contagious, spreads easily, and can remain in the air for up to two hours,” the letter reads. “Approximately 9 out of 10 people who are not immune will become infected when exposed. The MMR vaccine is the best way to protect your child and family from measles.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Any unvaccinated students who may have been exposed were directed in the letter to “stay home from school for 21 days,” which is the measles incubation period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;After that guidance was issued, attendance at the high school Monday wasn’t significantly affected, a district spokesperson told The Salt Lake Tribune in a statement, directing all other questions to the Wasatch County Health Department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;In Utah, K‑12 students must complete two rounds of vaccinations to attend public school: one before kindergarten and another before seventh grade, with different immunizations required at each stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;However, the law allows parents to request exemptions from all or some of the required vaccinations for medical, religious and personal reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://immunize-training.at.utah.gov/captivate/UtahSchoolsData_Kinder_UpdatedApr2025.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;state health department’s website&lt;/a&gt;, the exemption rate for kindergarten and seventh grade students has increased “dramatically since the pandemic.” During the 2024-25 school year, 9% of kindergarteners and 9% of seventh graders statewide had exemptions to one or more vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Wasatch County health officials have noticed the trend, said Lana North, a spokesperson for the county health department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“What we’re trying to do is just help people understand,” North said. “The biggest recommendation really is the MMR vaccine. And the reason that is is because it’s got about a 97% effectiveness rate, meaning that 97% of time, you’re not going to get sick if you’ve been fully vaccinated.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 13:01:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQUDg4aUdvanVvbU1ON0ljUVpXakdvRlplTmRtNzVRdDF1UGhXemtJUXlsTW5PZlRwTDZYWFdCZFE0QVRnSFlwQzkzaVN1VDZ1c1NkVVAwWFotSUZmY0psUEoxM0hMR1ZxRkFNclAtODVub0NPLUp2UkRFN2NMdlVtZA</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心网站更新后，家长应了解的关于自闭症和疫苗的哪些信息- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/25/health/autism-vaccines-parents-explainer-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Until last week, parents who looked at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website on autism and vaccines would see a few key points: Studies have not found links between &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/health/cdc-website-autism-vaccines"&gt;vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;, nor have links been identified between any vaccine ingredients and autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidqwuts000v3b6qssm0v2y2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the direction of US Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/health/kennedy-cdc-vaccine-guidance"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, the CDC page now has a different message: “Scientific studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines contribute to the development of autism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidq41yb000o3b6qenyqywr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS said the change was made to “reflect gold standard, evidence-based science.” But it drew a swift and sharp rebuke from doctors, scientists and advocates for people with autism, who say the website now includes misinformation and outdated and disproven ideas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidpmsy1000k3b6q834zmsq4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Medical researchers across the globe have spent more than 25 years thoroughly studying this claim. All have come to the same conclusion: Vaccines are not linked to autism,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/statement-from-leading-medical-health-and-patient-advocacy-groups-on-cdc-autism-website-changes/" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; from more than 60 organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association and the Autism Science Foundation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        What does research into autism and vaccines show?
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn00063b6nvnpz745d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Independent researchers across seven countries have conducted more than 40 studies involving over 5.6 million people to conclude that there is no link between vaccines and autism, said Dr.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Sean O’Leary, a professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases at the University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus and Children’s Hospital Colorado.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidnfp1s00013b6q2mjtpntg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Links between vaccines and autism have “been debunked many times,” O’Leary, who chairs the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said at a news briefing last week. “It is considered settled science.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn00073b6ngy1bfkjk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Alycia Halladay, the chief science officer for the Autism Science Foundation, noted that &lt;a href="https://autismsciencefoundation.org/autism-and-vaccines-read-the-science/" target="_blank"&gt;experiments&lt;/a&gt; in countries including Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Israel and Japan collected data from large groups of people and tracked their vaccination patterns and whether they had an autism diagnosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9kdz4l000f3b6qqr2oj6sa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All of those studies have shown no link between vaccines and autism,” she said. “It remains the number one studied environmental factor in autism, and there is no link whatsoever.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn00093b6nlozutkwj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More research is needed on many of the other purported causes of autism, she said, “but vaccines have 1,000% been exonerated” as a factor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiekls1t000l3b6q8rxc9z15@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Monday, &lt;a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2025/11/leading-autism-and-disability-organizations-statement-on-cdcs-vaccines-and-autism-page/" target="_blank"&gt;30 autism and disability organizations&lt;/a&gt; said linking autism and vaccines confuses parents. They called on the CDC “to revert the website to its previous version, commit to vaccine education initiatives around the country that emphasize the high-quality, scientific evidence that vaccines do not cause autism, and invest in research projects and initiatives that are responsive to the needs of autistic people and their families.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmi9htp9m001a3b6n7awy2jg5@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="where-did-claims-about-autism-and-vaccines-start" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Where did claims about autism and vaccines start?
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn000b3b6ncgt1150u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The pervasive myth linking vaccines and autism largely grew out of a 1998 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9500320/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by a British gastroenterologist named Dr. Andrew Wakefield that tied the measles, mumps and rubella shot to autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn000c3b6nz4aywz6p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the paper had &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/health/vaccines-fast-facts"&gt;major flaws&lt;/a&gt;: It included only about a dozen children and no control group; financial conflicts of interest; and fabricated data. Wakefield has long pushed back on criticisms of the study, but the paper was retracted in 2010 and Wakefield’s medical license was revoked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn000d3b6nmavl5dzh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many parents want to find an explanation for what was causing their children’s autism and to have “someone to blame,” Halladay said — and shots quickly became a scapegoat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn000e3b6nx9eoo4su@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The reality is that getting vaccinated isn’t exactly a fun procedure to begin with. You take your child to a pediatrician’s office, and they get a shot. They’re crying. It’s loud. It’s not a pleasant experience,” Halladay said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmidrfkc300123b6qmpcddh2f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If parents can believe that there is “something that they might be able to do to stop [their child’s autism], and also get to avoid those visits, they’ll do it. It’s really preying on the fears of parents and the idea that parents can do something to prevent their child’s autism. It’s taking advantage of parents who are vulnerable in that way.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn000f3b6nxadxvif8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After Wakefield’s paper was published, a flurry of research was conducted around the world&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to try to replicate the results, but the research came to much different conclusions than Wakefield’s paper.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hyla400003b6qsdrcz2b0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was retracted, but at the same time … the bell had been rung,” Halladay said: The claims of a link between autism and vaccines had taken hold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmie3ikrf00003b6qe6v2b549@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/15/health/autism-rate-cdc-report-2022"&gt;autism diagnosis rate&lt;/a&gt; has increased among US children, continuing a long-term trend that experts have largely attributed to better understanding of and screening for the condition. About 1 in every 31 children was diagnosed with autism by age 8 in 2022, up from 1 in 36 in 2020.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9jrpxn000a3b6nhi9y5zhs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Autism is complex, encompassing a spectrum of people who “are able to communicate and also have cognitive abilities and live independently, all the way to those needing 24/7 care,” Halladay said. This diversity is reflected in how there “can’t possibly be one cause for autism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9jrpxn000b3b6n0pfouzsq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Autism is highly genetic, and more than &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01104-0" target="_blank"&gt;250 genes&lt;/a&gt; have been found to be associated with it. “In about 15% to 20% of cases, we can find a single gene that causes autism, and in other cases, there may be multiple genetic mutations interacting to cause autism,” O’Leary said. “Genes that are associated with autism are highly expressed during fetal brain development and pregnancy, and they converge on biological pathways that involve how nerve cells communicate with each other.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9jrpxn000c3b6ng8lbauzg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some environmental factors, including maternal illness during pregnancy, can also “increase the probability of an autism diagnosis,” Halladay said. This is one of the reasons it’s important for pregnant women to stay up to date on recommended vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9jrpxn000e3b6nzfl2stzu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you have measles, you have a full-body rash. You have a fever that runs for days and days. You feel sick from being exhausted to having a fuzzy head to having respiratory problems to nausea for days and days, not just a few hours,” Halladay said. “ So this is much more serious than any reaction that you might have to the vaccine, which isn’t universal. Some people may have a fever for a few hours, but it’s nothing like getting actually sick with these diseases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9jrpxn000f3b6n763j8z7z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other factors that have been associated with autism include premature birth, parents who are older at the time of conception, fever during pregnancy and metabolic disorders such as gestational diabetes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn000j3b6na4illfya@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The update to the CDC’s website was not science-based, Halladay said, and that can be confusing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn000i3b6nj6k1384c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve been telling families for years to go to the CDC website, the CDC website has the information that you need, and now, all of a sudden, the information that was posted did not come from the CDC,” Halladay said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmie3uvy600083b6qia6zuxn4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
             “This current information was not vetted by any of the scientists from the Centers for Disease Control. It was shared by administrators at the Department of Health and Human Services, so it really isn’t scientific information.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Peer countries in Europe and the UK, Canada and Mexico all “have stood by the statement that vaccines do not cause autism,” Halladay said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9hq7tn000v3b6nzthcbejw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Halladay’s other advice to parents: “Trust your pediatrician. These are the people that know you. These are the people that see you in person and you know and can give you the best advice.”

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bones are living tissue and get stronger with regular movement, good nutrition, rest and care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight-bearing exercise, protein, calcium, vitamin D and other nutrients all help preserve bone strength.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small weekly habits—like mindful movement and prioritizing recovery—can keep bones strong for life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our bones are not as solid and stagnant as they may seem. They’re living tissue that renews itself constantly, and they require regular care. As adulthood advances, especially past midlife, bone strength becomes even more important. Weak bones increase the risk of fractures and can affect mobility, and when bones or joints feel achy or stiff, it can be a sign that your body needs more support through movement, nutrients or rest.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, peak bone mass is usually attained by around age 30, so what you eat and how you move when you’re younger forms the foundation for how strong your bones will stay later in life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

It’s about building resilience, preserving mobility and maintaining vitality well into older age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A combination of diet, movement, sleep and everyday habits plays a major role in how strong and steady our bones stay throughout life. And while more women than men are affected by osteoporosis, stronger bones are not just a women’s issue. Everyone benefits from routines that help keep bones strong and steady.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are seven weekly habits that dietitians recommend to help keep your bones healthy.

Move Your Body with Purpose &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to protecting bone health, movement is medicine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try to include resistance training at least twice a week and add some impact activities, if your body allows. Even simple habits like taking the stairs or carrying groceries can count.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.dawnjacksonblatner.com/about-dawn/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dawn Jackson Blatner, RDN, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, explains, “For someone who can’t or doesn’t want to do high-impact exercise like running or jump rope, the best exercises for bones are low-impact, weight-bearing exercise and  muscle-strengthening exercise.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Weight-bearing exercise is when your body holds itself up against gravity. Although high-impact workouts are great for bones, lower-impact options such as brisk walking, marching or stair climbing are still great options.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Jackson Blatner adds, “Muscle-strengthening exercise is when your muscles work against resistance. Body weight and bands are a great place to start to build muscle, and then working toward using weights, like free weights and/or machine weights. The weight puts stress on your muscle and bone in a good way, and encourages them to be stronger.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Jackson Blatner also reminds women that strong muscles and bones go hand in hand. “Strong muscles are your bones’ best friend. Muscles tug on bones, so anything that strengthens the muscle, is also strengthening the bone. Bottom line: You’re never just exercising muscle; you’re also training the bones underneath it.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And if you need one action step to try this week, Blatner says, “Do something that safely challenges your muscles, which in turn helps your bones. For example, sign up for a weight-lifting class at your local gym, pick up a slightly heavier weight than last week or do some jumps (hopscotch, anyone?).”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/calcium-benefits-8649279" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Calcium&lt;/a&gt; often gets top billing for bone health, but it’s only part of the picture. Your body also needs other important nutrients to build and maintain bone structure. According to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethwardrd/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Elizabeth Ward, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, “Several nutrients contribute to bone health, including protein, magnesium and vitamin K. Protein is necessary to make bone cells, and you need enough of it to build muscle that helps to keep you strong and upright. Vitamin K flies under the radar, but the body needs it to make a protein that activates bone cell production. The isoflavones in soy foods, such as tofu, tempeh and edamame, help slow down bone loss after menopause, too.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If calcium is Batman, vitamin D is Robin. It’s the trusty sidekick that helps calcium do its job by making sure it’s absorbed and used where it’s needed most: in your bones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://kerigansny.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Keri Gans, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, agrees that a food-first approach matters. “Food should always come first, but supplements can be important for many people. If your diet doesn’t provide enough calcium, vitamin D or other bone-supporting nutrients, supplements may work to fill the gaps. However, you’ll get the best results when they’re combined with calcium- and vitamin D-rich foods as part of an overall balanced diet. Foods like dairy, fortified plant milks, tofu, canned salmon with bones and leafy greens all contribute to stronger, healthier bones.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It may sound surprising, but research shows that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/prunes-benefits-8694943" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prunes&lt;/a&gt; can help preserve bone density, a distinction they share with other bone-building foods like dairy, leafy greens and fortified plant milks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Their unique blend of polyphenols and boron supports bone formation and may help reduce bone loss.

Research suggests that prunes may help inhibit bone resorption.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try blending prunes into smoothies, chopping them into salads, or eating a few as a sweet afternoon snack.

Be sure to read food labels to be more aware of the sources of sodium in your typical day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Minerals in the body are supposed to be in balance, so keeping sodium intake in check for heart health reasons may provide added bone benefits by optimizing our body’s ability to utilize calcium.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; She offers simple, flavorful swaps to make it easier to cut back. “As a flavor enhancer, salt tends to dominate, but herb and spice combinations, chili and other powders that add heat, vinegars, flavored oils, garlic and ginger can all add flavor without added sodium.”

Don’t Forget About Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/get-vitamin-d-without-supplement-11806255" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; plays a key role in calcium absorption, yet most people don’t get enough from food or sunlight alone. While we use sunscreen to protect our skin from wrinkles and damage as we age, it can also limit vitamin D production.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ward says, “It’s difficult for most women to satisfy the 15 micrograms per day suggested vitamin D intake because very few foods have vitamin D. You should try to eat vitamin D–rich foods every day, such as salmon (sockeye), mushrooms exposed to UV light, fortified dairy and soy milk and breakfast cereal (some yogurt has added vitamin D, too). You can fill in the gap with vitamin D supplements. There’s no need to go overboard on the supplements, however.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Short, regular bouts of sun exposure combined with vitamin D–rich foods and modest supplementation can help bridge the gap.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-prioritize-recovery--sleep"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 6. Prioritize Recovery &amp;amp; Sleep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rest and recovery are essential for strong bones. During sleep, your body repairs tissues, balances hormones and regulates processes that affect bone remodeling. Hormones play a major role in bone density, especially around menopause when estrogen levels begin to decline.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The biggest shift for bone health, starting in perimenopause, is decreasing estrogen levels,” says Ward. “Estrogen supports bone by discouraging bone cell breakdown and encouraging new bone cell production. Estrogen also protects bone tissue by suppressing inflammation and oxidation of bone cells, which contributes to a decline in bone density.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ward adds, “Nutrition and lifestyle can help offset some of the effects of estrogen loss, but not entirely.” The point is to do as much as you can to reduce bone loss. Ward tells us, “That means not smoking, exercising regularly and following a balanced diet rich in plants that provide isoflavones, magnesium, vitamin K and other nutrients, along with adequate protein, calcium and vitamin D.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-make-a-weekly-bone-check-plan"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 7. Make a Weekly Bone-Check Plan &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Strong bones aren’t built overnight. Setting aside a few minutes each week to check in on your movement, meals and self-care can make a lasting difference. Gans suggests making these mini check-ins part of your weekly rhythm. “Ask yourself: Did I move my body and consume enough calcium- and vitamin D–rich foods this week? A quick check like that helps keep bone health at the forefront,” Gans suggests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gans also reminds us that progress doesn’t require perfection. “Add calcium-rich foods regularly, stay active most days and get some sunlight for natural vitamin D. Small, steady actions have a much bigger impact than one-off efforts.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And if you think bone health is just for older women, Gans clears that up: “Bone density peaks between ages 25 and 30, and men also lose bone mass with age. Everyone benefits from protecting their bones early and maintaining healthy habits throughout life.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Consistency counts more than perfection. Bone health depends on everyday actions that add up over time, including nutritious meals, weight-bearing movement, quality rest and regular check-ins with your body. Every week you choose to move, eat well and care for your bones, you’re investing in strength that supports you for life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_68-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As Jackson Blatner reminds us, “Bones are alive, and they can get stronger at any age if you work them.”&lt;br&gt;

                Drugmakers have developed pill versions of GLP-1 medicines to treat obesity.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Millions of people use injectable drugs like Wegovy to reach a healthier weight. But the weekly injections aren't for everybody — or every wallet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's why experimental pills that could achieve similar results are drawing so much attention.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The medicines haven't yet won approval from the Food and Drug Administration, but the first one could get the green light by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The patient community in the obesity space has … gone without treatment for so long," says &lt;a href="https://www.obesityaction.org/about/governance/staff/" target="_blank"&gt;Tracy Zvenyach&lt;/a&gt;, director of policy strategy and alliances at the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://www.obesityaction.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Obesity Action Coalition&lt;/a&gt;. "So new innovations, new treatments to treat this chronic disease — all are welcome. All are exciting." The coalition &lt;a href="https://www.obesityaction.org/wp-content/uploads/OAC-Annual-Report-2023.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;receives financial support from multiple drugmakers&lt;/a&gt;, including Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know — from how much the pills might cost to how they work.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Two new pills are (probably) coming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk's obesity pill is expected to be approved first. It has the same ingredient — semaglutide — that's in Wegovy, Ozempic and also in Rybelsus, the company's Type 2 diabetes pill that was approved in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The difference between this new pill and Rybelsus is the dose. There's more semaglutide in the new pill.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk's main competitor is Eli Lilly, which makes Zepbound and Mounjaro. And it's working on an obesity pill, too. But instead of using the same ingredient that is in its blockbuster injectables, tirzepatide, the company is working on a new one for its obesity pill that is called orforglipron.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Patients will take the pills daily, not weekly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The pills need to be taken every day, but the injectables are once a week.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Novo Nordisk, it was a challenge making a semaglutide pill that wasn't immediately broken down in the stomach before the medicine could be absorbed. So the scientists there added an ingredient that would protect the pill for 30 minutes while it is being absorbed. It's a mouthful: sodium N-(8-[2-hydroxybenzoyl]amino)caprylate, or SNAC for short.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"If you think about dropping an Alka-Seltzer tablet in a glass of water, that immediate fizzy reaction that occurs, that is what happens in your stomach," says Andrea Traina, one of Novo Nordisk's obesity directors. "It creates this little foamy environment directly around the tablet."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That foam prevents a stomach enzyme from breaking the tablet down, lowers the stomach's acidity ever so slightly, and makes the cells under the pill a little bit more permeable so the semaglutide can get absorbed into the bloodstream more easily. The process takes about 30 minutes. It has to be taken on an empty stomach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly's orforglipron is a little different. It's not as vulnerable to being broken down in the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It has no food or water restrictions," says Dr. Max Denning, one of Eli Lilly's senior medical directors. "You can take it orally, and it's very effectively absorbed without any additional absorption enhancers or administration restrictions."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. They both work, but one appears to have an edge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a study published in September in the&lt;em&gt; New England Journal of Medicine,&lt;/em&gt; a 25 mg semaglutide pill led to a &lt;a href="https://www.novonordisk-us.com/media/news-archive/news-details.html?id=916429" target="_blank"&gt;16.6% reduction in weight&lt;/a&gt; on average over 64 weeks. That's about the same as Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly's obesity pill, orforglipron, had a &lt;a href="https://lilly.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-demonstrated-meaningful-weight" target="_blank"&gt;12.4% average weight loss&lt;/a&gt; at its highest dose over 72 weeks, which means it's less effective than injections on the market.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The drugs have similar side effects to the injectables, including nausea and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. These pills should cost less than the injectables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pills tend to be cheaper than injectables, so patients are hoping they'll be more affordable than the brand-name injected medicines with list prices of over $1,000 a month — and that insurance companies will be more likely to cover them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's easier to manufacture and the cost ultimately should be lower," says &lt;a href="https://www.tuftsmedicine.org/doctor/richard-siegel" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Richard Siegel,&lt;/a&gt; co-director of the Diabetes and Lipid Center at Tufts Medical Center. "One of the big problems with all of the medicines in this arena has been the cost. And can we equitably get these medicines to the millions, really, of people who might benefit from them?"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/poll-1-in-8-adults-say-they-are-currently-taking-a-glp-1-drug-for-weight-loss-diabetes-or-another-condition-even-as-half-say-the-drugs-are-difficult-to-afford/" target="_blank"&gt;a recent poll by KFF&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit health policy research organization, 1 in 8 people is currently taking an injectable drug in this class. While most of them have at least some insurance coverage, more than half said they had difficulty affording the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since early 2025, the drugmakers have made these medicines available at a discount to patients not using their health insurance, and the prices have come down a bit over time. As of early November, when Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5599122/wegovy-zepbound-price-deal" target="_blank"&gt;announced deals with the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;, the starting dose of Zepbound will be available for $299 a month for people buying without using insurance. And Wegovy will now be&lt;a href="https://www.novonordisk-us.com/media/news-archive/news-details.html?id=916460" target="_blank"&gt; available for $349&lt;/a&gt; a month.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While neither company has announced an official &lt;em&gt;list &lt;/em&gt;price for the experimental pills, their Trump administration deals say that if their oral obesity medicines &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;approved, they'll sell them directly to consumers for $149 a month. That means patients can get this price if they don't use their health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, if the pills get better insurance coverage, copays could be significantly lower than that.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. The FDA could act soon on the first two, and more new drugs are in the works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk's obesity pill is expected to win approval before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly, on the other hand, has said it will submit orforglipron for FDA approval this year. The drug won a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-awards-second-batch-national-priority-vouchers" target="_blank"&gt;priority review voucher&lt;/a&gt; from the agency, which could mean the agency will make a decision "within months."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also working on the next generation of these drugs, which could prove to be even more effective than the ones already on the market.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk is studying another compound called cagrilintide and a combination of cagrilintide and semaglutide. And Eli Lilly is studying retatrutide. Both are in Phase 3 clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, another company, Metsera, has several obesity drugs in its pipeline, though none is in late-stage clinical trials yet. Novo Nordisk tried to acquire the company, but it ultimately lost out to Pfizer, which completed the acquisition that &lt;a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/metsera-pfizer-accept-offer-novo-ftc-obesity-drugs/805080/" target="_blank"&gt;could ultimately be worth more than $10 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And I’m sorry, but the news gets worse: Thanksgiving is the disease’s favorite time of year. It seems our social calendar and our food supply are conspiring to give each of us this too-often-overlooked condition — with potentially deadly consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajh/article/38/2/120/7879521"&gt;Only about half&lt;/a&gt; of the people who have hypertension have it under control, a figure that has been declining over the past 10 years, even though this is among the most tractable public health problems that we have. With better monitoring, lifestyle modification, and medication, it is possible to reduce someone’s high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the problem is, many of the people who have it, especially younger patients, are totally unaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="why-hypertension-is-so-dangerous" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Why hypertension is so dangerous&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What is high blood pressure, exactly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Your blood pressure measures how hard the blood pumping through your veins is pushing against the walls of your arteries, and it serves as a proxy for how hard your heart and circulatory system have to work to move blood through your body. If you’ve ever had a physical exam or a routine check-up with your doctor, you’ve probably had your measurement taken using either a manual or automatic cuff. The standard healthy reading is 120/80 (the top figure measures the pressure during a heartbeat, and the bottom measures the pressure during those brief moments in between heartbeats).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If both numbers fall below that standard, it is considered to be a healthy reading. Anything above that starts to have negative consequences. First, arteries begin to harden, and organs can be damaged over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But high blood pressure and its effects on your body’s function can lead to other issues as well. It can damage your kidneys; hypertension is one of the leading causes of chronic kidney failure. It can damage your eyes, which are filled with tiny blood vessels, causing vision problems. And it can affect your cognition, driving up your risk of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Both your kidneys and your brain rely on being efficient filters in order to function; when the blood vessels inside of them get damaged, they become less efficient at filtering the bad stuff out of your body or your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over time, your blood pressure starts to rise — and a wide range of health problems can follow. The most obvious are heart attacks and strokes: Your blood vessels are damaged, and they start to accumulate plaque that further slows the flow of blood. When your blood flow becomes too obstructed, you can have a heart attack (if the blockage is near your heart) or a stroke (if it is in your brain) or a pulmonary embolism (if it is in your lungs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When that happens gradually, it can lead to heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) over the long term. Those conditions can kill you — either through a heart attack or pulmonary embolism. These are consistently among the leading killers in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; and worldwide, and even if you survive, you can face permanent paralysis or other lifelong limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Its pernicious nature is why the medical community &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/hyp.0000000000000065"&gt;changed the definition of high blood pressure in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, significantly increasing hypertension rates in the US. Before then, the cutoff for high blood pressure was actually 140/90; anything between that and 120/80 was considered to be “pre” hypertension — a warning that you are on track for serious problems, but not in the final stage of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But as research continued to show that heart and blood vessel damage could occur even at lower readings, scientists reconsidered. The final straw came in 2015 when &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/systolic-blood-pressure-intervention-trial-sprint-study"&gt;a large clinical trial of more than 9,000 people&lt;/a&gt; with elevated blood pressure found that lowering the patients’ blood pressure from 140/90 to 120/80 could cut their risk of serious cardiovascular events by 25 percent. When the definition was changed, US hypertension rates jumped from about &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20501926/"&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db511.htm"&gt;nearly 50 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Far more people were at risk than had previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And yet, despite being so obviously dangerous and so widespread, many people still don’t know if they have high blood pressure. By one estimate, &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/news/increasing-proportion-of-adults-unaware-they-have-hypertension/"&gt;nearly 40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of adults younger than 45 who have hypertension don’t know it. How can that be possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There is no obvious sign that you have it — unless you get checked regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;High blood pressure has a reputation among doctors as a “silent” killer: Patients sometimes experience no symptoms or very mild and vague symptoms. I once had a nurse remark to me that some people are walking around with blood pressures over 200 and have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It is only through the repeated and consistent measurement of your blood pressure over time that you can know with certainty whether you have a problem. A one-off reading — say, while you’re waiting at the pharmacy — can be misleading in either direction. Your blood pressure fluctuates throughout the day, and even if you have hypertension, you can get a normal reading sometimes. Conversely, if you have a spike of stress while being measured, you could have a high reading even without an underlying issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But here’s the problem: Many Americans, particularly young people, &lt;a href="/23817170/family-doctor-primary-care-physician-general-practitioner-shortage"&gt;don’t see a health care provider regularly&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly half of the people in the US under 30 don’t have a primary care physician. And they may be paying the price: Data &lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/about-acc/press-releases/2019/03/07/08/45/heart-attacks-increasingly-common-in-young-adults"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; heart attacks and other cardiovascular events are up among young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-you-can-do-to-manage-your-blood-pressure" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What you can do to manage your blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Hypertension, like many diseases, does have a genetic or hereditary component — if you have a family history, you are at higher risk — but if you regularly eat too much sodium and do not get enough exercise, you’re putting yourself at risk, too. A traditional Thanksgiving dinner, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/local/sodium-thanksgiving-healthy-holiday-meals/1933261/"&gt;can easily have more sodium&lt;/a&gt; than any person is supposed to eat in an entire day. And lying on the couch for the entire afternoon after that meal isn’t helping either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Luckily, Thanksgiving only comes once a year. But too many Americans eat salt-rich diets and stay sedentary the rest of the year, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;You can change that. Doctors have come up with what they call &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan"&gt;the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet&lt;/a&gt; as the best strategy for managing your blood pressure. You should eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, beans and nuts, and whole grains. You should try to eat foods that are high in fiber and potassium (which helps your kidneys filter sodium); you, of course, want low-sodium and low-fat foods too. I typically buy the no salt added or reduced sodium options for, for example, chicken broth. Red meats and processed foods, both of which are linked to hypertension, are your enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the end, you want to eat between 1,500 and 2,000 milligrams of sodium in a day and no more. You could drink less alcohol and less caffeine, both of which raise your blood pressure temporarily, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;On the exercise front, working out is not always a foolproof weight-loss strategy — but it is proven to be effective in lowering your blood pressure. Walking, jogging, swimming, cycling, and even dancing are all good for you. But regardless of what you’re doing, your goal should be about 150 minutes per week. It is best to combine that classic “cardio” exercise with strength training (which both lowers blood pressure on its own and makes your aerobic workouts more effective) and even stretching and breathing routines like yoga, which can help regulate your heart and lead to better sleep. All of these things can help to keep your blood pressure down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There is also &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/types-of-blood-pressure-medications"&gt;a wide range of existing blood pressure medications&lt;/a&gt;, which can be very effective but do come with some risks, such as blood thinners that can cause excessive bleeding. We are entering a new age of medicine, however, in which wearable tech that allows patients to monitor their blood pressure minute by minute and GLP-1s are likely to become more commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Apple Watch rolled out &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117296"&gt;a blood pressure monitoring capability&lt;/a&gt; this fall: You can turn on hypertension notifications, and your device will notify you if it detects consistently high blood pressure. The wearable tech company Oura Labs is working on something similar. Right now, the best way to monitor at home is to buy your own blood pressure cuff like the one at your doctor’s office; my own physician pointed me to the Omni units to monitor my blood pressure at home. They can cost &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=omni+blood+pressure+cuff&amp;amp;adgrpid=186079070869&amp;amp;hvadid=779670021752&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvexpln=0&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9015344&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvocijid=9797264897866607049--&amp;amp;hvqmt=e&amp;amp;hvrand=9797264897866607049&amp;amp;hvtargid=kwd-308821316558&amp;amp;hydadcr=21881_13323216_12880&amp;amp;mcid=d88a5aed6da23bbda9746bb329869e3e&amp;amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;amp;ref=pd_sl_70jzgnjqri_e"&gt;as little as $40&lt;/a&gt;, and if you have an FSA or an HSA, it is an eligible expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But this can be a little inconvenient — you have to sit down, take a few minutes to get your blood pressure to “normal,” and then affix the cuff correctly to ensure you’ll get an accurate reading. Having the same capability walking around with you on your wrist at all times would be a boon, much like continuous glucose monitoring has helped people better manage their diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These are effectively brand new prototypes, however. As Apple itself &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117296"&gt;warns&lt;/a&gt;, they should not be used to diagnose hypertension or to monitor and control it. Not everybody who has high blood pressure will have it detected by the Apple Watch. And it may not even be able to detect serious cardiac events, such as a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Likewise, the new class of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ajh/hpaf205/8300155"&gt;has shown&lt;/a&gt; modest benefits for hypertension, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.scai.org/media-center/news-and-articles/glp-1-studies-add-growing-body-evidence-demonstrating-significant"&gt;reduced risk of heart attack and stroke&lt;/a&gt;. But that science is preliminary. We still have a lot to learn about those drugs and, even if they are effective, they would work best in tandem with a blood pressure-conscious diet and exercise routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;The good news is that high blood pressure is a health problem you can do something about.

The issue is among the most intensively studied in the scientific literature, and the results among the most conclusive: There’s no connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why the revision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of its advisory on vaccines and autism struck like a thunderbolt, and not in a good way. The original statement was this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies have shown that there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing autism spectrum disorder ... No links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and ASD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class="quote"&gt; &lt;blockquote class="m-0"&gt; &lt;p class="quote-body"&gt;Dr. Cassidy, he lied to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p class="quote-attribution"&gt;— CNN’s Jake Tapper, citing RFK Jr.’s reneging on pledge he made to Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) to leave CDC advisories on childhood vaccinations unchanged&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of last week, the statement says: “The claim ‘vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One can’t say that the change was a bolt from the blue, because Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has telegraphed his intention to revisit the causes of autism for months. The change in the CDC language is merely the most concrete indication that his campaign against child immunizations is undermining the science of public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;  &lt;ps-newsletter-module data-element="newsletter-module" class="@container/newsletter-module block" data-id="519" data-module-id="0000019a-b7ad-d00b-af9f-bfad20180013"&gt; &lt;div data-element="newsletter-module-layout" class="flex flex-col border-solid border-0 border-t border-cms-color-neutral-border @lg/newsletter-module:flex-row @lg/newsletter-module:gap-4"&gt;  &lt;div class="group"&gt; &lt;header class="flex flex-col flex-wrap gap-4 mb-2.25 pt-4 @lg/newsletter-module:pt-8 @lg/newsletter-module:flex-row"&gt;  &lt;h3 data-element="module-title" class="font-cms-font-brand-heading font-bold text-2xl leading-6.5"&gt;Get the latest from Michael Hiltzik&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;/header&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/ps-newsletter-module&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is much more to be concerned about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reporting on RFK Jr.’s assault on public health since his name first surfaced as &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-11-19/column-trumps-appointment-of-anti-vaxxer-rfk-jr-to-his-cabinet-has-scientists-fearing-a-catastrophe-for-public-health"&gt;a possible cabinet appointee&lt;/a&gt; in President  Trump’s second term.

Bill Cassidy (R-La.).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(CDC)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy appointed a proponent of the discredited claim connecting vaccines and autism to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-04-01/rfk-jr-puts-anti-vaxxer-in-charge-of-studying-debunked-link-between-vaccines-and-autism"&gt;oversee a study of the purported link&lt;/a&gt;. He and Trump tried to associate autism among children with their mothers having taken Tylenol during pregnancy—and even &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-10-14/rfk-jr-tylenol-and-circumcision-the-lowdown"&gt;associating autism with circumcision&lt;/a&gt;. (There’s no scientifically validated evidence for those conjectures.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, at his first news conference since taking office, Kennedy spouted a fountain of misinformation about autism. He called it an “epidemic” that is “running rampant,” which is untrue. He said “most cases now are severe,” which is untrue. In fact the vast majority of new cases involve children without the intellectual disabilities often associated with stereotypical autistic behavior, such as sensitivities to touch and an absence of verbal skills. The prevalence of more severe cases actually has declined in recent years, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/151/2/e2022056594/190525/Prevalence-and-Disparities-in-the-Detection-of" target="_blank"&gt;a study from Rutgers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy consistently has cited statistics pointing to years of increased autism prevalence, as reflected in ever larger diagnoses, suggesting they point to an “epidemic” of autism and blaming childhood vaccines as a likely factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-04-22/rfk-jr-s-views-on-autism-show-that-anti-science-myths-are-rampant-at-the-agency-he-leads"&gt;as I’ve reported&lt;/a&gt;, researchers have made great strides in unearthing the causes and characteristics of autism. Among other factors, they’ve identified genetic anomalies that may produce a predisposition to the condition. Scientific research has absolved vaccines as a cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism also has been defined ever more broadly over the years — indeed, it’s seen today as a smorgasbord of conditions summed up as “autism spectrum disorder. “ Despite all that, Kennedy continues to demonize childhood immunization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s altered webpage reflects what I’ve reported as &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-04-22/rfk-jr-s-views-on-autism-show-that-anti-science-myths-are-rampant-at-the-agency-he-leads"&gt;Kennedy’s pseudoscientific mindset&lt;/a&gt;, relying on claims that have been standard fare for antivaccine activists like himself. Its assertion that “studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism” is a travesty of the scientific method. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science is not well-equipped to prove a negative — as some of Kennedy’s critics note, there’s no proof that drinking Coca-Cola or eating pizza doesn’t cause autism, either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by casting doubt on autism research, Kennedy overlooks the research that has been done on vaccines and autism — studies of more than 2 million children around the world, finding no connections whatsoever. Instead, the CDC statement misrepresents some research it does cite, asserting that “approximately one in two surveyed parents of autistic children believe vaccines played a role in their child’s autism, often pointing to the vaccines their child received in the first six months of life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study the CDC cites for that claim was published in 2006 and was drawn from surveys of 150 parents of children diagnosed with ASD at two private medical practices; the parents were given a six-page, self-administered survey. Only 77 parents responded. Of the respondents, 54% mentioned immunizations as a possible cause of their children’s ASD, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper was “just about parents’ views, not the science of autism,” John Harrington, the paper’s lead author, told me. “It’s definitely not evidence-based in terms of whether vaccines cause autism.” The study itself states that its purpose was “to measure parental beliefs and not to measure their accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked Kennedy’s agency to comment on this apparent misrepresentation but haven’t received a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blast radius from Kennedy’s change in the CDC website is vast. The first circle of damage is the possibility that it will encourage more parents to resist immunizations for their children. We already have seen the ramifications from the vaccine hesitancy encourage by Kennedy and his fellow antivaxxers: Reported measles cases in the U.S. reached 1,753 as of Nov. 18, the largest case load since 1991. Other vaccine-preventable diseases such as whooping cough also are on the rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next circle is the CDC’s own reputation, which Kennedy has relegated to the dumpster. Once arguably the most trusted public health agency in the world, the CDC has deteriorated into an untrustworthy “propaganda machine for RFK Jr.’s fixed, immutable, science-resistant theories,” vaccinologist Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia told researchers at the University of Minnesota. “The CDC is being &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/after-unprecedented-autism-vaccine-messaging-change-scientists-advocates-say-cdc" target="_blank"&gt;weaponized to promote RFK Jr.’s antivaccine point of view&lt;/a&gt;. So why should you trust it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those whose reputations are shattered along with the CDC’s under Kennedy’s onslaught is Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), whose vote was a key to confirming him as Health and Human Services secretary. That was because Cassidy, a physician, was skeptical about Kennedy’s suitability for the job, but folded his cards when Kennedy made him several promises, including that he wouldn’t touch the makeup of the vaccine advisory committee. Cassidy’s vote gave Kennedy the majority he needed for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has broken most of those promises. Last week’s breach was the most recent. In announcing his confirmation vote, Cassidy  said  Kennedy  pledged that “the CDC will not remove statements on their website pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy stuck to that pledge, somewhat — but in a way that arguably intensifies the humiliation he has delivered to Cassidy since the confirmation vote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement “Vaccines do not cause Autism” is still on the CDC website, but it is now accompanied by an asterisk that refers to language asserting that the original statement remains posted “due to an agreement with the chair of the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee [that is, Cassidy] that it would remain on the CDC website.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This feels like a shiv aimed at Cassidy: The website undermines the claim that vaccines don’t cause autism and says the language remains only because of the promise Kennedy gave to Cassidy and no other. I asked Cassidy’s office if the senator took umbrage at the insult but got no reply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday on CNN, however, Jake Tapper put the issue forthrightly. “Dr. Cassidy,” he said, “he lied to you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassidy dodged Tapper’s implication, repeating several times that “vaccines are safe” and accusing Tapper of trying to stir up a “titillating” fight between Republicans. As it happens, Kennedy in 2023 launched a campaign for the presidential nomination as a &lt;i&gt;Democrat&lt;/i&gt;, the party long identified with Kennedy’s family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3c1335/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/320x89!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/020e8ec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/568x158!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c3c0a73/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/768x213!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/05bf37d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/1024x284!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fb442e6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/1200x333!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="measles" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5b69322/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/320x89!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/93c1881/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/568x158!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/67a8277/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/768x213!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53ffc6f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/1024x284!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c405009/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/1200x333!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c405009/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2882x800+0+0/resize/1200x333!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4e%2F5c%2Fa6b11c4f43deb1db6d640e44fa5c%2Fmeasles.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;With 1,753 U.S. cases of measles reported so far this year—the largest outbreak since 1992—RFK Jr.’s campaign against child vaccinations appears to be jeopardizing public health&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(CDC)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassidy also posted a tweet Thursday, after the CDC website change, stating, “What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1991599014270365829" target="_blank"&gt;safe and effective and will not cause autism&lt;/a&gt;.

Los Angeles County recently reported its first flu death of the season, and other nations are reporting record-breaking or powerful, earlier-than-expected flu seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, flu picks up right after Christmas and into the New Year, but Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional physician chief of infectious diseases at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, said she expects increases in viral activity perhaps over the next two to three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re expecting an early and likely sharp start to the flu season,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year’s flu season was the worst California had seen in years, and it’s not usual for there to be back-to-back bad flu seasons. But a combination of a decline in flu vaccination rates and a “souped-up mutant” is particularly concerning this year, according to Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases expert at UC San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That may translate into more people getting infected. And as more people get infected, a proportion of them will go to the hospital,” Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of this new flu subvariant — called H3N2 subclade K — is particularly problematic. It emerged toward the end of the summer, long after health officials had already determined how to formulate this fall’s flu vaccine, a decision that had to be made in February. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H3N2 subclade K seems to be starting to dominate in Japan and Britain, Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It looks like a bit of a mismatch between the seasonal flu vaccine strains” and the new subvariant, Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear whether subclade K will reduce the effectiveness of this year’s flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California and the rest of the U.S., “things are quiet, but I think it’s just a calm before the storm,” Chin-Hong said. “From what we see in the U.K. and Japan, a lot more people are getting flu earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong noted that subclade K is not that much different than the strains this year’s flu vaccines were designed against. And he noted data recently released in Britain that showed this season’s vaccines were still effective against hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the British government, &lt;a class="link" href="https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2025/11/11/how-well-will-i-be-protected-from-flu-this-year-with-the-current-uk-influenza-vaccines/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccinated children&lt;/a&gt; were 70% to 75% less likely to need hospital care, and adults were 30% to 40% less likely. Flu vaccine effectiveness is typically between 30% to 60%, and tends to be more effective in younger people, the British government &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-providing-important-protection-despite-new-subclade" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if there is some degree of mismatch between the vaccine and circulating strains, “the flu vaccine still provides protection against severe illness, including hospitalizations,” according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public Health strongly encourages everyone who has not received the flu vaccine yet this year to receive it now, especially before gathering with loved ones during the holidays,” the department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But “while mismatched vaccines may still provide protection, enhanced genetic, antigenic and epidemiological ... monitoring are warranted to inform risk assessment and response,” according to scientists &lt;a class="link" href="https://utppublishing.com/doi/10.3138/jammi-2025-0025" target="_blank"&gt;writing in&lt;/a&gt; the Journal of the Assn. of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the vaccine is not a perfect match for the latest mutated flu strain, Chin-Hong said getting antiviral medication like Tamiflu to infected patients may be especially important this year, even for those who are vaccinated. That’s especially true for the most vulnerable, which include the very young and very old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But that means you need to get diagnosed earlier,” Chin-Hong said. Drugs like Tamiflu work best when started within one to two days after flu symptoms begin, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are now at-home flu testing kits that are widely available for sale for people who are showing signs of illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also worrying is how the flu has surged in other countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia’s flu season came earlier this year and was more severe than usual. The &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.racgp.org.au/the-racgp/about-us/about-the-racgp" target="_blank"&gt;Royal Australian College of General Practitioners&lt;/a&gt; said that nation saw a record flu season, with more than 410,000 lab-confirmed cases, up from the prior all-time high of 365,000 that were reported last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not a record we want to be breaking,” Dr. Michael Wright, president of the physician’s group, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.racgp.org.au/gp-news/media-releases/2025-media-releases/october-2025/australia-posts-record-breaking-flu-numbers-as-vac" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudson noted Australia’s flu season was “particularly hard on children” this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L.A. County health officials cautioned that Australia’s experience isn’t a solid predictor of what happens locally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is difficult to predict what will happen in the United States and Los Angeles, as the severity of the flu season depends on multiple factors including circulating strains, pre-existing immunity, vaccine uptake, and the overall health of the population,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new strain has also thrown a wrench in things. As Australia’s flu season was ending, “this new mutation came up, which kind of ignited flu in Japan and the U.K., and other parts of Europe and Asia,” Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Japan reportedly issued a national alert with flu cases surging and hospitalizations increasing, especially among children and the elderly, accompanied by a sharp rise in school and class closures. The Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/16175605" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; children ages 1 through 9 and adults 80 and up were among the hardest-hit groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese health officials warned of the possibility of a second peak in flu this year, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202511180022" target="_blank"&gt;Central News Agency&lt;/a&gt;. There was already a peak in late September and early October — a month earlier than normal — and officials are warning about an uptick in flu cases starting in December and then peaking around the Lunar New Year on Feb. 17. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese officials said 95% of patients with severe flu symptoms had not been recently vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British health officials this month issued a “flu jab SOS,” as an &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/11/nhs-issues-flu-jab-sos-with-worst-of-winter-only-weeks-away/" target="_blank"&gt;early wave&lt;/a&gt; struck the nation. Flu cases are “already triple what they were this time last year,” Public Health Minister Ashley Dalton said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In England, outside of pandemic years, this fall marked the earliest start to the flu season since 2003-04, scientists &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Eurosurveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have to brace ourselves for another year of more cases of flu,” Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major concern has been declining flu vaccination rates — a trend seen in both Australia and the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Australia, only 25.7% of children age 6 months to 5 years were vaccinated against flu in 2025, the lowest rate since 2021. Among seniors age 65 and up, 60.5% were vaccinated, the lowest rate since 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australian health officials are promoting free flu vaccinations for children that don’t require an injection, but are administered by nasal spray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We must boost vaccination rates,” Wright said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., officials recommend the annual flu vaccine for everyone age 6 months and up. Those age 65 and up are eligible for a higher-dose version, and kids and adults between age 2 and age 49 are eligible to get vaccinated via the FluMist nasal spray, rather than a needle injection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials this year began allowing people to order FluMist to be &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-nasal-spray-influenza-vaccine-self-or-caregiver-administration" target="_blank"&gt;mailed&lt;/a&gt; to them at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides getting vaccinated, other ways to protect yourself against the flu include washing your hands frequently, avoiding sick people and wearing a mask in higher-risk indoor settings, such as while in the airport and on a plane. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy high-risk people, such as older individuals, can be prescribed antiviral drugs like Tamiflu if another household member has the flu, Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are especially concerned about babies, toddlers and young children up to age 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those are the kids that are the most vulnerable if they get any kind of a respiratory illness. It can really go badly for them, and they can end up extraordinarily ill,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, just 49.2% of children had gotten a flu shot as of late April, lower than the 53.4% who had done so at the same point the previous season, according to preliminary national &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;survey results&lt;/a&gt;. Both figures are well below the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/interactive/general-population-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;final flu vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt; for eligible children during the 2019-20 season, which was 63.7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among adults, 46.7% had gotten their flu shot as of late April, slightly down from the 47.4% at the same point last season, according to the preliminary survey results, which are the most recent data available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before the COVID-19 pandemic, flu vaccination coverage had been slowly increasing; downturns in coverage occurred during and after the pandemic. Flu vaccination levels have not rebounded to pre-pandemic levels,” &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disparaging of vaccinations by federal health officials, led by the vaccine-skeptic secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has not helped improve immunization rates, health experts say. Kennedy &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/us/politics/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccines-autism-website.html" target="_blank"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the New York Times on Thursday that he personally directed the CDC to change its website to abandon its position that vaccines do not cause autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainstream health experts and former CDC officials denounced the change. “Extensive scientific evidence shows vaccines do not cause autism,” wrote Daniel Jernigan, Demetre Daskalakis and Debra Houry, all former top officials at the CDC, in an &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ms.now/opinion/msnbc-opinion/cdc-officials-rfk-jr-vaccine-autism-letter-rcna245128" target="_blank"&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; to MS NOW. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CDC has been updated to cause chaos without scientific basis. Do not trust this agency,” Daskalakis, former director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/dr_demetre/status/1991345475350589928?s=46" target="_blank"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; on social media. “This is a national embarrassment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials from California, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii on Friday called the new claims on the CDC website inaccurate and said there are decades of “high quality evidence that vaccines are not linked to autism.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over 40 high-quality studies involving more than 5.6 million children have found no link between any routine childhood vaccine and autism,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said Friday. “The increase in autism diagnoses reflects improved screening, broader diagnostic criteria, and greater awareness, not a link to vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudson said it’s important to get evidence-based information on the flu vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines save lives. The flu vaccine in particular saves lives,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQU0dRdzg4TThoZFJCZGU3U2dGbDBQbnFzU2xhVF9CRjIySFR2bjF1UFhNNThSbnZ6YVRocU1IbFRQbzJDZjBqR1ZwM3dTNnZLZE1vV1hPU3IzbzBhR3dZTlQzaHZkckdfUmtETzFhZ1owZ25UellGM2o3MTJBTDV0QjJrZ1Q5eXNKa0xMcHJSaE1UYkk0dnFxNzRXNEFtTnh4b0Y5RHJoVjhmZDRkQWRyYll6Mi1zTnR2</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，大脑有五个“时代” --成人模式要到30岁出头才开始--《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/25/brain-human-cognitive-development-life-stages-cambridge-study</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Scientists have identified five major “epochs” of human brain development in one of the most comprehensive studies to date of how neural wiring changes from infancy to old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65974-8" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt;, based on the brain scans of nearly 4,000 people aged under one to 90, mapped neural connections and how they evolve during our lives. This revealed five broad phases, split up by four pivotal “turning points” in which brain organisation moves on to a different trajectory, at around the ages of nine, 32, 66 and 83 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Looking back, many of us feel our lives have been characterised by different phases. It turns out that brains also go through these eras,” said Prof Duncan Astle, a researcher in neuroinformatics at Cambridge University and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Understanding that the brain’s structural journey is not a question of steady progression, but rather one of a few major turning points, will help us identify when and how its wiring is vulnerable to disruption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The childhood period of development was found to occur between birth until the age of nine, when it transitions to the adolescent phase – an era that lasts up to the age of 32, on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a person’s early 30s the brain’s neural wiring shifts into adult mode – the longest era, lasting more than three decades. A third turning point around the age of 66 marks the start of an “early ageing” phase of brain architecture. Finally, the “late ageing” brain takes shape at around 83 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The scientists quantified brain organisation using 12 different measures, including the efficiency of the wiring, how compartmentalised it is and whether the brain relies heavily on central hubs or has a more diffuse connectivity network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;From infancy through childhood, our brains are defined by “network consolidation”, as the wealth of synapses – the connectors between neurons – in a baby’s brain are whittled down, with the more active ones surviving. During this period, the study found, the efficiency of the brain’s wiring decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Meanwhile, grey and white matter grow rapidly in volume, so that cortical thickness – the distance between outer grey matter and inner white matter – reaches a peak, and cortical folding, the characteristic ridges on the outer brain, stabilises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the second “epoch” of the brain, the adolescence era, white matter continues to grow in volume, so organisation of the brain’s communications networks is increasingly refined. This era is defined by steadily increasing efficiency of connections across the whole brain, which is related to enhanced cognitive performance. The epochs were defined by the brain remaining on a constant trend of development over a sustained period, rather than staying in a fixed state throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We’re definitely not saying that people in their late 20s are going to be acting like teenagers, or even that their brain looks like that of a teenager,” said Alexa Mousley, who led the research. “It’s really the pattern of change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She added that the findings could give insights into risk factors for mental health disorders, which most frequently emerge during the adolescent period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At around the age of 32 the strongest overall shift in trajectory is seen. Life events such as parenthood may play a role in some of the changes seen, although the research did not explicitly test this. “We know that women who give birth, their brain changes afterwards,” said Mousley. “It’s reasonable to assume that there could be a relationship between these milestones and what’s happening in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;From 32 years, the brain architecture appears to stabilise compared with previous phases, corresponding with a “plateau in intelligence and personality” based on other studies. Brain regions also become more compartmentalised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The final two turning points were defined by decreases in brain connectivity, which were believed to be related to ageing and degeneration of white matter in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 10:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPWndGQzA4eC10Qlk3VFd0VFJTVnJiNGFpa04zWkZ5aDNob0llQWVOczZwaXJ6S0hheVZyNkNwMlp1VVcwbWJpZVBERy1CM2VaYzNxYzhoZ2dHeHRYa3p1ajhHRGt4SGI4NnBWX1pPSEdLWWEwZkVJTG9BLXVPcURfeTVNNTZlU2VWSWktOFQyYWpMNHJlY2dTNHVGRDBiTVg5bWdrWjgwc3BralU2SXc</guid></item><item><title>数百万老年人生活在美国的“癫痫带” ，科学家可能终于知道原因- ZME Science</title><link>https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/mind-and-brain/millions-of-seniors-live-in-americas-epilepsy-belt-and-scientists-may-finally-know-why/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where you grow old in the United States may change your odds of developing &lt;a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/what-is-epilepsy-and-what-should-we-know-about-it-44338"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2841156"&gt;new study in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has mapped where older Americans are most likely to be diagnosed with epilepsy and points to a broad “epilepsy belt” running through the South, from Louisiana and Mississippi through Eastern Texas and Central Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The work, led by researchers at Case Western Reserve University and Houston Methodist, focused on those 65 and older enrolled in traditional Medicare. This is the group that already faces the highest rate of new epilepsy diagnoses in the country, yet until now, no one had a detailed map of where those cases cluster and what local conditions might be linked to them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed Medicare claims in the United States between 2016 and 2019, focusing on those who received a new diagnosis of epilepsy in 2019 and had no epilepsy-related claims in the previous three years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rate of new epilepsy diagnoses that year ranged from 141 to 1,476 cases per 100,000, a more than tenfold gap. Hotspots concentrated in Louisiana, Eastern Texas, Central Oklahoma and parts of the Deep South. Lower-rate regions appeared in stretches of the Great Plains, Midwest and Northeast.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That pattern looks strikingly similar to the long-known “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_Belt"&gt;stroke belt&lt;/a&gt;” in the southeastern U.S., where stroke deaths have been high for decades. Stroke is the leading cause of epilepsy in older adults, so that overlap fits what neurologists already see in clinics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sleep-heat-and-everyday-barriers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep, heat and everyday barriers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;





&lt;p&gt;So, what were some of the reasons for the seizures?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lack of sleep stood out at the top of the list. In regions where a large share of adults reported sleeping less than seven hours per night, older residents were much more likely to live in an epilepsy hotspot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sleep and epilepsy already have a tight relationship. Poor sleep can trigger seizures, and seizures can disrupt sleep. Sleep problems grow more common with age and are closely tied to poverty and chronic stress, which are more frequent in parts of the South and Appalachia that lit up on the map.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Heat was another strong signal. Areas with more days where the heat index topped 95 degrees Fahrenheit tended to show higher epilepsy rates among older adults. Hot days cluster in southern states and are becoming more frequent as the climate warms. Long stretches of extreme heat strain the heart and blood vessels, unsettle sleep, and discourage outdoor activity — a mix that can feed into stroke and other brain injuries that later lead to epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Models also pointed toward physical inactivity, obesity, and a high share of uninsured adults as markers of high-incidence areas. Many of the regions with elevated epilepsy rates are areas where large numbers of people reach age 65 after decades with limited access to primary care and preventive services, often while living with untreated or poorly controlled chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regions with a larger share of residents working in agriculture or natural resources tended to have lower epilepsy rates, as did places with more recent arrivals from other states. The authors suggest that agricultural work may reflect more active daily lives and lower population density, and that high in-migration may point to healthier, more economically mobile populations. However, the researchers stress that those are informed guesses, not firm explanations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-does-and-does-not-tell-people"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What this does — and does not — tell people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study sits at the “ecological” level, meaning it looks at places rather than individual medical charts. It cannot be said that a particular person developed epilepsy because their county is hot, sleep-deprived, and car-poor. Personal risk still depends on many things such as stroke history, head injuries, infections, tumors, genetics, and sometimes unknown causes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even so, the patterns matter. The map clearly shows that epilepsy in older adults is not spread evenly across the country and that it tends to cluster in communities facing a long list of social and environmental challenges. Those conditions are not fixed. Better sleep health programs, stronger stroke prevention, heat-wave planning that protects older residents, improvements in transportation, and earlier insurance coverage could all reduce the number of people with vulnerable brains and limited care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, the authors argue that public health agencies and policymakers can use their map as a guide. High-burden regions in the South may warrant extra neurologists, more stroke and sleep clinics and outreach tailored to communities with poor access to transportation and care. Lower-rate areas in the Midwest and West are not off the hook either; they can still learn from the patterns and protect gains as the population ages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For older Americans and their families, the message is simple but not hopeless: Epilepsy risk in late life is tied not just to biology but to the places people move through every day.

It's always strengthening and weakening connections and it's not one steady pattern - there are fluctuations and phases of brain rewiring," Dr Alexa Mousley told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some people will reach these landmarks earlier or later than others – but the researchers said it was striking how clearly these ages stood out in the data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;These patterns have only now been revealed due to the quantity of brain scans available in the study, which was published in the journal Nature Communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;The five brain phases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="childhood" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Childhood &lt;/b&gt;- The first period is when the brain is rapidly increasing in size but also thinning out the overabundance of connections between brain cells, called synapses, created at the start of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The brain gets less efficient during this stage. It works like a child meandering around a park, going wherever takes their fancy, rather than heading straight from A to B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="adolescence" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Adolescence&lt;/b&gt; - That changes abruptly from the age of nine when the connections in the brain go through a period of ruthless efficiency. "It's a huge shift," said Dr Mousley, describing the most profound change between brain phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This is also the time when there is the greatest risk of mental health disorders beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Unsurprisingly adolescence starts around the onset of puberty, but this is the latest evidence suggesting it ends much later than we assumed. It was once thought to be confined to the teenage years, before neuroscience suggested it continued into your 20s and now early 30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This phase is the brain's only period when its network of neurons gets more efficient. Dr Mousely said this backs up many measures of brain function suggesting it peaks in your early thirties, but added it was "very interesting" that the brain stays in the same phase between nine and 32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="adulthood" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Adulthood &lt;/b&gt;- Next comes a period of stability for the brain as it enters its longest era, lasting three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Change is slower during this time compared with the fireworks before, but here we see the improvements in brain efficiency flip into reverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Mousely said this "aligns with a plateau of intelligence and personality" that many of us will have witnessed or experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="early-ageing" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Early ageing&lt;/b&gt; - This kicks in at 66, but it is not an abrupt and sudden decline. Instead there are shifts in the patterns of connections in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Instead of coordinating as one whole brain, the organ becomes increasingly separated into regions that work tightly together - like band members starting their own solo projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Although the study looked at healthy brains, this is also the age at which dementia and high blood pressure, which affects brain health, are starting to show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="late-ageing" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Late ageing &lt;/b&gt;- Then, at the age of 83, we enter the final stage. There is less data than for the other groups as finding healthy brains to scan was more challenging. The brain changes are similar to early ageing, but even more pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Mousely said what really surprised her was how well the different "ages align with a lot of important milestones" such as puberty, health concerns later in life and even the pretty big social shifts in your early 30s such as parenthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'A very cool study'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The study did not look at men and women separately, but there will be questions such as the impact of menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Duncan Astle, professor of neuroinformatics at the University of Cambridge, said: "Many neurodevelopmental, mental health and neurological conditions are linked to the way the brain is wired.

Add a few years to the eligibility age. Drop a few pack-years — a measure combining how much and how long someone has smoked. Remove a quit-time rule. Repeat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it was never really a math problem. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.46222" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study in JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt; makes clear what many of us in cancer prevention and control have been warning for over a decade: No amount of technical adjusting will fix a system built on stigma.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I see the effects of this every day. As a behavioral scientist and nurse practitioner, I’ve sat with hundreds of patients confronting the potential of a lung cancer diagnosis. I’ve watched people brace themselves before they say the words “I used to smoke,” even when they quit decades ago. I have watched people who have never smoked rush to explain why they got lung cancer at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These reactions aren’t personal quirks. They are predictable responses to a system that has taught people to expect judgment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That system is failing on its own terms. The &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2841677" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; examined nearly 1,000 people diagnosed with lung cancer at a major academic medical center and found that 65% would not have qualified for screening under today’s U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/lung-cancer-screening" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;criteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Let that sink in: Two-thirds of people who develop the deadliest cancer in the country would never have been offered the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1102873" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one test proven&lt;/a&gt; to save their lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it gets worse. Even if policymakers expanded the criteria — lowering the pack-year threshold, removing the quit-time requirement, widening the age range — almost 40% of cancers would still be missed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The population ineligible for screening is not random. It is disproportionately women, Asian Americans, and people who have never smoked. These are groups the current framework structurally misclassifies as “lower risk,” despite real-world &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37863179/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only one approach captures nearly all of them: &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2841677" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;age-based screening&lt;/a&gt;. The test itself is straightforward: a low-dose CT scan that takes about 10 minutes and exposes patients to minimal radiation. Screen everyone ages 40 to 85, regardless of smoking history, and you detect 94% of cancers and prevent more than 26,000 deaths every year.  The &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.46222" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cost&lt;/a&gt; is lower than what we routinely pay for breast or colorectal cancer screening. The number needed to screen to prevent one lung cancer death is 320. For comparison, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26756588/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mammography&lt;/a&gt; requires screening about 1,339 women to prevent one breast cancer death, and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2208375" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt; requires screening about 455 people to prevent one colorectal cancer death. Yes, broader screening means more false positives and follow-up imaging, but these trade-offs are manageable — and far less burdensome than the status quo, which misses two-thirds of cases entirely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You would think this evidence would be enough to prompt immediate policy change. But there’s a deeper problem that policymakers fail to acknowledge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Age-based screening would eliminate smoking history as an eligibility requirement. But even that fix will fail if clinicians continue to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36865902/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;interrogate&lt;/a&gt; patients about tobacco use during the encounter, or if public messaging keeps framing lung cancer as a “smoker’s disease.” The stigma is baked into the culture of lung cancer care, not just the eligibility criteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, lung cancer is the only major cancer that requires patients to recount their past behavior to determine whether they deserve early detection. No other screening program requires a behavioral confession. No other cancer demands a precise accounting of past conduct as a gateway to lifesaving care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not a risk assessment. It is a judgment system designed as one. And it is a policy choice that suppresses exactly the participation we need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my research studies on lung cancer &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25736473/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stigma&lt;/a&gt;, participants have shared stories that still stay with me. One man in his early 60s, a former construction worker who had quit smoking more than a decade earlier, told me he postponed his screening appointments repeatedly because he felt embarrassed to talk about his past tobacco use. Even after years of being smoke-free, he worried preventive care would turn into a judgment of the years when cigarettes were a coping mechanism for demanding work and family strain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another participant, a woman in her 50s who met the eligibility criteria, explained that she avoided screening because she believed she had “brought this on herself” by smoking in her teens and 20s. She told me she did not feel entitled to use health care resources for something she associated with personal failure.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Their experiences reflect patterns I see across my research: self-blame, anticipated judgment, and internalized &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29800746/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stigma&lt;/a&gt; routinely suppress participation in lung cancer screening. Their stories are not just anecdotes; they are data points that reveal how stigma shapes real-world behavior long before a person arrives at a clinic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fewer than &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.19798" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;1 in 5&lt;/a&gt; eligible Americans undergoes lung cancer screening — the lowest uptake of any major cancer screening in the country. Breast and colorectal screening rates are more than triple that number. Stigma is not a secondary factor here. It is the central explanation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Decades of behavioral science show that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29800746/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stigma&lt;/a&gt; reduces disclosure, undermines trust, and discourages engagement with health systems. These are not abstract effects. They shape whether someone shows up for screening at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet the USPSTF continues to treat smoking history as a kind of eligibility exam, ignoring &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/radon/health-risk-radon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;radon exposure&lt;/a&gt; (the second leading cause of lung cancer), air pollution, occupational hazards, and genetic predisposition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, clinicians must rely on pack-year calculations that &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2737091" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; are missing or inaccurate in over 80% of medical records — errors that disproportionately harm &lt;a href="https://news.nm.org/new-study-shows-lung-cancer-surveillance-in-the-united-states-misses-most-patients-northwestern-medicine-researchers-urge-universal-age-based-screening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6604090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Black Americans&lt;/a&gt;, who develop lung cancer at lower pack-year exposures than the guidelines assume.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new study reveals something else policymakers should take seriously. Patients who were ineligible for screening had better survival than those who met the criteria: a median of 9.5 versus 4.4 years. The authors attribute part of this to tumor biology. But there is another possibility worth considering: These patients’ cancers were caught incidentally, during imaging for unrelated issues. They bypassed the stigma-laden screening pathway altogether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the system meant to save people is one they avoid, something is broken — not at the individual level, but at the policy level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This demands a different kind of response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The USPSTF should move toward age-based screening criteria, or at least a hybrid model, that no longer hinges on a detailed smoking history. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services should stop tying reimbursement to burdensome pack-year documentation that blocks access. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health should fund stigma-reduction interventions with the same vigor they apply to “awareness” — because awareness cannot overcome shame.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health systems have their own work to do. Clinicians need stigma-informed communication training. Electronic medical records need prompts that do not require perfect recall from patients. And &lt;a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/decreasing-smoking-increasing-stigma-anti-tobacco-campaigns-public-health-and-cancer-care/2017-05" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;public messaging&lt;/a&gt; must reflect the complex etiology of lung cancer rather than reducing it to tobacco use alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Age-based screening is good science. But science alone is not enough. If stigma continues to shape how we design, communicate, and deliver lung cancer screening, participation will remain low, disparities will deepen, and thousands of preventable deaths will continue every year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The deadliest cancer in America does not need more incrementalism. It needs policymakers willing to confront the barrier they built into the system from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

Cardiologist Dmitry Yaranov underlines this reality in a widely shared &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRXFmDnAK0_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Instagram video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;: “The foods everyone tells you are ‘healthy’ might actually be hurting your heart. … It’s that your heart, kidneys, and medications change how your body handles salt, potassium, and metabolism.” His insight reminds us that nutrition cannot be considered in isolation when your cardiovascular system or drug regimens are involved. As more people juggle chronic illness, treatments and lifestyle advice, understanding how these six seemingly benign foods can strain heart health has never been more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoid these 6 foods you think are healthy but can harm your heart &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Bananas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas are celebrated for their rich potassium content and natural sweetness, making them a go-to healthy snack. According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/treatment-options-for-heart-failure/hyperkalemia-high-potassium?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, those with weakened kidney function or those on potassium-sparing medications such as spironolactone or angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), the potassium from bananas may not be excreted efficiently. Excess potassium can accumulate in the bloodstream, altering the heart’s electrical stability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Yaranov warns, “If your kidneys are struggling … potassium can build up too high.” In such cases, something as innocuous as a banana can contribute to dangerous levels of serum potassium and elevate the risk of arrhythmias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Impaired potassium excretion leads to hyperkalaemia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High potassium interferes with cardiac cell electrical activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elevated risk of dangerous arrhythmia in patients with kidney or heart dysfunction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potassium-sparing drugs amplify the effect&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;What is wrong with the Indian diet: Cardiologist and bestselling author Dr. Aseem Malhotra in conversation with Kalpana Sharma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Spinach&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinach is rich in vitamins, fibre and minerals, commonly hailed as a superfood. Yet its high potassium content can pose challenges to individuals whose organs or medications disrupt electrolyte regulation. Moreover, spinach is high in vitamin K, which has a direct impact on warfarin therapy. As Yaranov points out: “Spinach … affects warfarin consistency. Healthy, but needs consistency, not ‘as much as possible’.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/consumer-healthcare/medication-information/medication-interactions-food-supplements-and-other-drugs" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; says that for people on anticoagulants, sudden increases or decreases in vitamin K intake can destabilise INR (International Normalized Ratio) control, thereby increasing risk of bleeding or clot formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High potassium may challenge renal or cardiac potassium handling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Variable vitamin K intake disturbs warfarin anticoagulation levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sudden changes in dietary vitamin K cause instability in blood clotting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Risk of arrhythmia if potassium builds up&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Grapefruit&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grapefruit is packed with antioxidants and vitamin C, making it a seemingly wise dietary choice. But it also contains furanocoumarins that suppress CYP3A4, a key enzyme in the liver and intestines that helps metabolise many cardiac drugs. Yaranov cautions: “Grapefruit … can push drug levels way past safe.” A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26299317/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in the American Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; mentions that when people take certain statins or calcium-channel blockers, grapefruit can significantly raise systemic drug levels, increasing the risk of toxicity, side-effects, or dangerous interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inhibits CYP3A4 enzyme, reducing metabolism of many medications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raises blood levels of statins or CCBs, increasing risk of drug toxicity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alters first-pass metabolism, leading to unpredictable drug concentrations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can potentiate adverse drug reactions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Soy sauce&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soy sauce is used around the world to flavour food, but for people with heart failure or hypertension, even small amounts can be dangerous due to its high sodium content. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/42/21/2103/6044174" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published by European Heart Journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; warns against sodium; sodium excess forces the body to retain water, increasing blood volume, which raises pressure on the already compromised heart. Yaranov highlights this risk clearly: “One sushi night can mean two pounds of fluid retention and shortness of breath tomorrow.” This fluid overload burdens the heart, leading to swelling, breathlessness or worse in fragile patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excess sodium leads to water retention and increased blood volume&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher circulatory volume stresses the heart&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aggravates fluid overload in heart failure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;May contribute to hypertension and worsened cardiac outcomes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Liquorice&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11494093/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in Journal of Human Hypertension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, black liquorice contains glycyrrhizin, which interferes with the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, causing excess activation of mineralocorticoid receptors. This effect imitates an overproduction of aldosterone, leading to salt retention, potassium loss and elevated blood pressure. Yaranov warns: “Real black liquorice raises blood pressure and lowers potassium.” Such disruptions are problematic for those with hypertension or on medications that affect mineral balance, and they may cause dangerous electrolyte disturbance and increased cardiovascular stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glycyrrhizin promotes sodium retention and potassium excretion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Results in hypertension via a pseudohyperaldosteronism effect&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Electrolyte imbalance increases risk of arrhythmia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic intake may provoke long-term vascular strain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Alcohol&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is socially acceptable and often perceived as harmless in moderation, yet it can have direct toxic effects on the heart muscle. Chronic or heavy drinking may lead to dilated cardiomyopathy, weakening the heart’s ability to pump effectively. Yaranov states bluntly: “Alcohol, direct cardiac toxin. For some, it’s the reason the heart got weak in the first place.” In a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5513687/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in Alcohol Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, alcohol is shown to increase the risk of arrhythmias, interfere with the metabolism of heart medications, and contributes to blood pressure instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Direct toxic effect on cardiac muscle leading to weakened contraction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased risk of arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interactions with medications amplify cardiovascular risk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long-term intake promotes structural heart changes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers have developed nasal drops that travel along the nerves of the nose into the central nervous system to fight the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-deadliest-kind-of-brain-cancer-may-have-a-promising-new-treatment"&gt;deadliest brain cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary test results reveal that the medication safely reached its target, helping protect mice against these usually fatal tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an approach that offers hope for safer, more effective treatments for glioblastoma and potentially other immune treatment-resistant cancers, and it marks a critical step toward clinical application," &lt;a href="https://siteman.wustl.edu/nasal-drops-fight-brain-tumors-noninvasively/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurosurgeon Alexander Stegh of Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This redefines how  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="182806" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; immunotherapy can be achieved in otherwise difficult-to-access tumors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-vaccine-for-deadly-brain-cancer-shows-incredible-results-in-clinical-trial"&gt;New Vaccine For Deadly Brain Cancer Shows Incredible Results in Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma"&gt;Glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt; tumors are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-therapy-obliterates-deadly-brain-tumor-in-days"&gt;highly aggressive&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-test-detects-deadly-brain-cancers-in-just-one-hour"&gt;hard to detect early&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41416-018-0258-8"&gt;deactivate&lt;/a&gt; our body's typical immune response, making them challenging to target with traditional cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're also very hard to reach, given they form in the brain or elsewhere along our delicate central nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This nasty cancer &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-tumors-can-rewire-the-brain-and-we-just-found-out-how"&gt;impairs brain functions&lt;/a&gt; by causing swelling in surrounding healthy tissues, compressing them, and stealing their blood supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_142588" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142588" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/Glioblastom_WHO_Grad_IV_im_MRI_preoperativ_und_postoperativ-e1763953887584.png" alt="MRI Image of a Glioblastoma before and after surgery" class="wp-image-142588 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-142588" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Surgery is currently the first stage of glioblastoma treatment.

Interferon genes usually alert the body to a viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, drugs that achieve this break down rapidly in the body, requiring multiple invasive administrations to reach the tumor directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington University neuroscientist Akanksha Mahajan and colleagues developed a simpler way to deliver drugs where they're needed using nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We really wanted to minimize patients having to go through that when they are already ill, and I thought that we could use the spherical nucleic acid platforms to deliver these drugs in a noninvasive way," &lt;a href="https://siteman.wustl.edu/nasal-drops-fight-brain-tumors-noninvasively/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Mahajan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They transformed STING-activating molecules into spherical genetic material to maintain their stability for longer. To achieve this, the researchers wrapped the genetic material around a gold nanoparticle core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then tested their medicine in mice with glioblastomas. They found that their gold-mounted genetic instructions successfully activated the STING pathway to inhibit tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With this research, we've shown that precisely engineered nanostructures, called spherical nucleic acids, can safely and effectively activate powerful immune pathways within the brain," &lt;a href="https://siteman.wustl.edu/nasal-drops-fight-brain-tumors-noninvasively/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Stegh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers caution there's still a long way to go before human  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="182806" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;, and this tactic will need to be backed up by other methods of attack, as the cancer cells can circumvent the STING pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the nose drops were paired with other drugs designed to boost immunity, the researchers were able to induce long-term immunity against glioblastoma in the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain cancer. &lt;a href="https://glioblastomafoundation.org/news/glioblastoma-multiforme"&gt;Only 6.9 percent&lt;/a&gt; of patients survive beyond five years after diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When my grandmother developed metastatic brain tumors after being diagnosed with end-stage breast cancer, I experienced the vicious toll the disease had on her and everyone around her," Stegh has &lt;a href="https://acgtfoundation.org/story/stegh/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Her battle inspired me to confront this insidious disease, and my education and training led me to do so by pioneering a better understanding of the genetics behind brain tumors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2409557122"&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-025-04176-x" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;new 2025 prospective cohort study published in BMC Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; looked at nearly 9,700 older adults and found that leisure activities, rather than highly structured or “planned” exercise, were more consistently associated with reduced all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

This means that exercising too much or always pushing for high-intensity training, without balance, may lead to diminishing returns and potentially stress your body in ways that counteract longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How to slow down ageing process at 40!

A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2405452622001008" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2023 study in the Journal of Interprofessional Education &amp;amp; Practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; underlined that neglecting self-care routines increases stress and diminishes longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress triggers inflammation, cellular wear and tear and may damage DNA over time. Without adequate recovery habits like rest, mindfulness or deliberate downtime, the body may pay the price in accelerated biological ageing. This is consistent with the principle of hormesis (short, controlled stress followed by rest), which ageing researchers argue helps build resilience but only when followed by recovery. Overwhelming stress without rest may do the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Being “too healthy”: When lifestyle factors backfire&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another twist is that even healthy lifestyle factors can carry a hidden cost when not balanced.

Moreover, another &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11476187/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2024 study in PMC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; on long-term behaviour found that while exercise and a healthy diet reduce death risk, extremely high exercise levels can’t fully erase the damage of a poor diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why these “healthy” habits can age you faster&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers point out that too much of a “good” thing (like high-intensity exercise or constant productivity) raises the biological cost where stress hormones, inflammation and cellular wear accumulate. Without adequate rest, the body can’t repair itself. Hormetic stress only helps if followed by recovery; otherwise, it causes damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies establish that hyper-disciplined or “always-on” health regimen may itself become a source of stress, undermining mental well-being and accelerating biological ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to avoid these backfire risks: Healthy ageing, the smart way&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aim for Balance, Not Extremes - &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Combine moderate exercise with relaxing leisure activities; include both structured workouts and unstructured play or restful movement. World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines state that adults “should undertake regular physical activity”, 150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, or the equivalent and muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week. The same WHO guidelines emphasise that “doing some physical activity is better than doing none.” These guidelines support the idea of balance over extremes so instead of pushing to high-intensity every session, incorporate moderate workouts and lighter, enjoyable movement (like dancing, walking, recreational sports).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritise Recovery - &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Add deliberate recovery rituals into your week (rest days, meditation, downtime), ensure good sleep, resist the hustle-constant mindset. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasises that for good health and brain function, you need enough quality sleep (including regular schedule, appropriate environment). Harvard Health Publishing recommends good sleep hygiene with consistent bedtime, winding down and limiting screen time as part of “Sleep Better With Healthy Lifestyle Habits”. Recovery is not optional. The evidence supports ensuring restful sleep and downtime, rather than constant “go-go” activity. Prioritising recovery aligns with preventing chronic stress and metabolic wear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Health Habits - &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Have healthy routines but don’t let them become rigid stressors. Adjust lifestyle according to energy, work demands, mental health. WHO and the UN’s Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021–2030) framework supports a “life-course approach” to health by building habits that adapt over time rather than one-size-fits-all regimes. The NHS recommends in older-adult activity guidelines, “If you've fallen or are worried about falling, doing exercises to improve strength, balance and flexibility will help … do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity if you are already active, or a combination of both.” These sources support the need for adaptive, flexible routines with exercise and health behaviours that respect your current body and avoiding rigid “all or nothing” approaches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Final thought&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the quest to age well, it is not enough to just do the “right” things instead, how you do them matters deeply. Some of the cleanest, most virtuous habits can backfire if they are unbalanced, extreme or lacking in recovery. As the science shows, moderation, resilience and rest are key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a lifestyle that supports longevity does not mean doing more; it often means doing less but more wisely. So think twice as those habits that look ultra-healthy may not be your ticket to eternal youth unless you pair them with balance, recovery and self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

Simply put, we're suited to being in natural spaces, not built-up cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's the conclusion reached by two evolutionary anthropologists, Colin Shaw from the University of Zurich in Switzerland and Daniel Longman from Loughborough University in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They pulled together a wealth of evidence that suggests our biological evolution is being outpaced by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tab-overload-is-a-common-problem-for-people-browsing-the-internet-survey-finds"&gt;rapid technological&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-five-maps-reveal-how-shockingly-little-wilderness-remains"&gt;environmental transformations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily lives filled with triggers that put us slightly on edge, from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mondayitis-could-have-a-deadly-effect-on-your-body"&gt;overflowing inboxes&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/noise-pollution-hurts-animals-heres-how-to-turn-the-volume-down"&gt;construction noise&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-4-day-work-week-experiment-begins-in-the-uk-the-largest-ever-conducted"&gt;work deadlines&lt;/a&gt;, are combining to put our bodies on alert around the clock – something that hasn't been the case for much of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/discovery-of-1-5-million-year-old-bone-tools-rewrites-early-human-history"&gt;human history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stress-sensitive-neurons-may-have-a-powerful-effect-on-our-entire-brain"&gt;Stress-Sensitive Neurons May Have a Powerful Effect on Our Entire Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In our ancestral state, we were well-adapted to deal with acute stress to evade or confront predators," &lt;a href="https://www.news.uzh.ch/en/articles/news/2025/into-the-woods.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Shaw. "Fight or flight. The lion would come around occasionally, and you had to be ready to defend yourself – or run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key is that the lion goes away again. Such an all-out effort guaranteed survival, but it was very costly and required lengthy recovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182729" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182729" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/UrbanLiving.jpg" alt="Urban living graph" class="wp-image-182729 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/UrbanLiving.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/UrbanLiving-600x351.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182729" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers point out that urban populations are rising.

In evolutionary terms, being outdoors in nature is still where human beings want to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that gives us some clues as to what to do about dealing with the issues raised by this review. Shaw and Longman want to see more done to preserve green areas in urban environments, to protect the natural landscapes we have left, and to provide spaces where people can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/being-in-nature-has-a-profound-effect-on-how-you-experience-time"&gt;actually switch off&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research can identify which stimuli most affect blood pressure or heart rate and pass that knowledge on to decision-makers," &lt;a href="https://www.news.uzh.ch/en/articles/news/2025/into-the-woods.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Shaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to get our cities right – and at the same time regenerate, value and spend more time in natural spaces."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.70094"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biological Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Truly, Cali does not need a GPS, because she is the GPS. The video’s on-screen caption reads, “When your internal compass always leads you to a 5-star hotel suite.” Under the video, its witty caption doubles down on the Golden Retriever’s intelligence in the &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/196718-bulldog-high-standards-first-hotel-experience-video"&gt;hotel&lt;/a&gt;, reading, “Can’t remember if she had breakfast, but never forgets the way to a good hotel room.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt;’s video begins inside the hotel’s elevator. Cali stands in front of her owners, eager to get out and show her skills. As soon as the doors slide open, the pup springs out with her tail wagging and her leash swinging from her mouth, not looking back even once to check in on her owners. Instead, she marches ahead while her owners follow behind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cali takes a right and then another right, finally taking a left turn before walking straight into the carpeted corridor. Her owners follow her, laughing as Cali purposefully trots down the hallway. Finally, the Golden Retriever stops at a door and looks back at her owners in anticipation, and one tap of the key card proves she had been leading them to the right room all this time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Viewers flooded the comments with praise and jokes about Cali’s impressive memory. One user wrote, “I love how she looks back like, ‘Told you I knew where it was,’” while another fan quipped, “She said I know where my food and bed is.” Others admired her confidence, with a viewer teasing, “That golden wagging antenna cannot go wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some followers even imagined Cali as a canine travel critic. One joked, “Step aside, Michelin Keys and Forbes Stars,” adding, “I want my hotels rated by Cali Paw Prints!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

In the last few years, walking has become the new “it” workout activity — whether for simply keeping fit or reaping a plethora of other health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why walking though? Because it’s simple, it’s effective, it doesn’t need expensive gym benefits, nor any gear. On top of that, it comes with health benefits that stretch from cardiovascular health to longevity-related concerns!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;From right shoes to warming up right: 5 safety rules to follow while walking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if someone signs up for walking and can’t meet the standardized goal, i.e., the 10,000 steps? Does nothing short of 10K steps count?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s the buzz around 10,000 steps?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re one of those who can’t hit the 10,000 steps every day, don’t worry, you’re not alone — that big, bold number isn’t a marker or a biological law. In fact, the 10,000-step target began as a 1960s marketing idea, not a health rule. As per &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/10000-steps-a-day-or-fewer-2019071117305" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Dr. I-Min Lee, an associate epidemiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a researcher on physical activity, discovered that the origins of the number (10,000 steps) go back to 1965, when a Japanese company made a device named Manpo-kei, which translates to “10,000 steps meter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean anything less than that isn’t acceptable!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667%2825%2900164-1/fulltext" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and public-health guidance now make two things clear:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaningful health gains begin well below 10,000 steps,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even short bursts of walking add up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s a ‘good’ count?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although “10,000 steps” has been shorthand for fitness for years, modern studies show the health benefits of walking begin at far lower daily volumes — and recent large analyses point to strong gains around 5,000–7,000 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, public-health agencies focus less on a single step-count target and more on total weekly activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Adults are advised&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week (or 75 minutes vigorous), which can be met by brisk walking spread across days. Importantly, the United States guidelines and recent reviews emphasize that activity does not need to come in long chunks — short bouts add up and provide real benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;So what’s the shortest walk that still helps?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find an answer to that, science points to surprisingly small doses. Systematic reviews and trials show that even a few minutes of sustained, purposeful walking can make a difference. For example, 5–10 minutes at a brisk pace produces measurable benefits: improved mood, small gains in blood pressure and glucose control, and reduced sedentary time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39554919/#:~:text=Previous%20efforts%20have%20been%20focused,behavior;%20healthy%20lifestyle;%20inactivity." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2024 review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that multiple short sessions are linked to improved cardiometabolic markers and higher adherence than long sessions, meaning people stick with short walks more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, large population studies give context on longer-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8417757/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;landmark cohort&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found big reductions in premature mortality for adults taking at least about 7,000 steps per day compared with very low step counts — benefits that rose steeply up to that point and then levelled off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667%2825%2900164-1/fulltext" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;A 2025 synthesis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; of global data reached similar conclusions: substantial gains occur well below 10,000 steps, with much of the “early” benefit concentrated in the lower to mid step ranges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s the practical approach?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What matters is how well you incorporate walking into your daily life, because consistency matters more than intensity here. So, if you’re inactive, even adding a single 5– to 10–minute brisk walk — getting your heart rate up and breathing a bit harder — matters. Those short walks count toward the 150-minute weekly goal, break long sitting spells, and help build a habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people, a practical target is to move from very low activity (say 2,000 steps) toward 5,000–7,000 steps daily over time — that shift brings meaningful health returns and is more achievable than jumping straight to 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to make short walks effective: Tips that help&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Walk briskly when you can&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; — effort matters more than length.

These compounds act as strong antioxidants, helping protect cells from DNA damage and oxidative stress, which are major triggers for cancer development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oncologist also points out that these tubers are a staple in the “blue zones”, regions of the world where people live the longest with low levels of chronic disease. Dr. Mussallem recommends a simple approach: steam, bake, or lightly roast them to enjoy their natural sweetness while maximizing their anti-cancer benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxNbENmYmlKVnREUWFXVUlnc25wRDl4QjRkLUhjTHFuRHRJeks5WmladTI3ZDNjU2YzeHhZajNCUS0tcWdGQTZqcktxVENhZnpEeGZyZ1NFQW5nZWJFay1qVHI5Z0h6SXc5bmdFMVhuT2RsS0Y0QnB2S0d5dGFqcTRfTklUclNHUm9ZX3hJM2stRWJJZXNZV1hFam9PNWVWcUVKVGVSd2x2TXBtUlV3OEZfRFpzWm5ZVFMzdndvSzJFa2d0Y1hVU2EtMWl3dTBjSFJwV0JSOW1aWVRMUGlLbXdiMHB2YlJKaXZEOWVRaTljUTRuYXhGM0ZJ0gH_AUFVX3lxTFBNSjhKZHIyVkU2Sndvd3VDSklKbXpHaEVkVW9INDNMUjctak5sNzBseE9HMHh6WEVkLUd1SEpWSlJNQVdneExJY3UxczBhZW8ySGpYYjFqVThoR2tpdWUzWXg2bEY3UnlzUmwzM09WRVp6a3p3Y1BPU1RGLUNfbGxjNFdBQ0Z2WEl6Vm5jMFdScjgwNDlVNE03QkdKWXRJaWNtSXhCTVlZVUNGclBJbllCV1BCbzFHMWdIREN4MTV5eE94eFp0UTJKU2VjTWJiREJpX1ZYUlhVMS1uZUhuQlZKRjRlMV9zN3o1bC1Ed1lQeklETWpJU1FVWDJrdmtaTQ</guid></item><item><title>可爱的橙色猫在午餐时间的兴奋是如此相关- PetHelpful</title><link>https://pethelpful.com/pet-news/adorable-orange-cats-excitement-over-lunchtime</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PetHelpful</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 01:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQWHotYnk3RDdfTkJnWFdlMEZoWTBvVkNtZVZYOGppZFhtdml2SE5sd18tVFlfSnE0OWlrN0dvb1ZjdnMzYmFlZjJXMXZHLUNMdFVjQjlCa0dubUEwTmhVQnY3VXhyWHlsLUsyUVYwd0JWUkFnR0Nrb1N1aDRmdjJpWlppaU4</guid></item><item><title>中年的健康问题可能与怀孕几年前有关-《西雅图时报》</title><link>https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/health-issues-in-middle-age-can-be-linked-to-pregnancy-years-earlier/</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxNc2owaUVMMXhCSEk5Z0xHTmltX2JfUWwzWFB6MC03R2dYaEkxaDVSQzRUZ29FWGVyaVczV2FfNnlsckZIN01xaGpGbmxGN2FYcU4xc2N5VXRWY2xGYllmUGpLOXJIbmdFektQZmRoY0hSazlsYnd0YWJ0WVZXSV9uY1JKUkVPclQ1Zjh3Rm13U1dCSzA3R2FXR3NmY28xcmdUUDN3dG1OQWM1bzFuWGVyQg?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Health issues in middle age can be linked to pregnancy years earlier&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 00:51:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNc2owaUVMMXhCSEk5Z0xHTmltX2JfUWwzWFB6MC03R2dYaEkxaDVSQzRUZ29FWGVyaVczV2FfNnlsckZIN01xaGpGbmxGN2FYcU4xc2N5VXRWY2xGYllmUGpLOXJIbmdFektQZmRoY0hSazlsYnd0YWJ0WVZXSV9uY1JKUkVPclQ1Zjh3Rm13U1dCSzA3R2FXR3NmY28xcmdUUDN3dG1OQWM1bzFuWGVyQg</guid></item><item><title>徒步旅行者对人们在自然小径上参与的“胡说八道”趋势感到沮丧： “想知道为什么人们认为这很可爱或有趣” -雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/hiker-frustrated-over-nonsense-trend-001500639.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A nature-lover recently had to vent about something especially irritating to the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:r/hiking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;r/hiking&lt;/a&gt; community on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Anyone else get pissed off with seeing plastic sculptures and garden ornaments on walking trails in a nature trail?" &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/1d0h6ps/people_leaving_plastic_garden_ornaments_in_forest/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wrote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; the original poster.

Sadly, this isn't an isolated incident. Other hikers have stumbled upon trees given the full Christmas treatment along trails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While this kind of decoration is well-meaning, it produces the same risks as illegal dumping, which also introduces plastic items to natural habitats.

Abandoned fishing lines are particularly lethal.

When she wakes up, she will regain consciousness more quickly and clearly because she required lower doses of anaesthetic drugs such as propofol and opioid painkillers than patients who heard no music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;That, at least, is what a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://mmd.iammonline.com/index.php/musmed/article/view/1111" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;new peer-reviewed study&lt;/a&gt; from Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College suggests. The research, published in the journal Music and Medicine, offers some of the strongest evidence yet that music played during general anaesthesia can modestly but meaningfully reduce drug requirements and improve recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The study focuses on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the standard keyhole operation to remove the gallbladder. The procedure is short - usually under an hour - and demands a particularly swift, "clear-headed" recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To understand why the researchers turned to music, it helps to decode the modern practice of anaesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Our aim is early discharge after surgery," says Dr Farah Husain, senior specialist in anaesthesia and certified music therapist for the study. "Patients need to wake up clear-headed, alert and oriented, and ideally pain-free. With better pain management, the stress response is curtailed." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Achieving that requires a carefully balanced mix of five or six drugs that together keep the patient asleep, block pain, prevent memory of the surgery and relax the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Indian surgeons medical team performing surgery in operation theater at hospital" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Patients need to wake up clear-headed and ideally pain-free after surgery&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In procedures like laparoscopic gallbladder removal, anaesthesiologists now often supplement this drug regimen with regional "blocks" - ultrasound-guided injections that numb nerves in the abdominal wall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"General anaesthesia plus blocks is the norm," says Dr Tanvi Goel, primary investigator and a former senior resident of Maulana Azad Medical College. "We've been doing this for decades."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the body does not take to surgery easily. Even under anaesthesia, it reacts: heart rate rises, hormones surge, blood pressure spikes. Reducing and managing this cascade is one of the central goals of modern surgical care. Dr Husain explains that the stress response can slow recovery and worsen inflammation, highlighting why careful management is so important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The stress starts even before the first cut, with intubation - the insertion of a breathing tube into the windpipe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To do this, the anaesthesiologist uses a laryngoscope to lift the tongue and soft tissues at the base of the throat, obtain a clear view of the vocal cords, and guide the tube into the trachea. It's a routine step in general anaesthesia that keeps the airway open and allows precise control of the patient's breathing while they are unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The laryngoscopy and intubation are considered the most stressful response during general anaesthesia," says Dr Sonia Wadhawan, director-professor of anaesthesia and intensive care at Maulana Azad Medical College and supervisor of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Although the patient is unconscious and will remember nothing, their body still reacts to the stress with changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To be sure, the drugs have evolved. The old ether masks have vanished. In their place are intravenous agents - most notably propofol, the hypnotic made infamous by &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-15634083" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Michael Jackson's death&lt;/a&gt; but prized in operating theatres for its rapid onset and clean recovery. "Propofol acts within about 12 seconds," notes Dr Goel. "We prefer it for short surgeries like laparoscopic cholecystectomy because it avoids the 'hangover' caused by inhalational gases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The team of researchers wanted to know whether music could reduce how much propofol and fentanyl (an opioid painkiller) patients required. Less drugs means faster awakening, steadier vital signs and reduced side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So they designed a study. A pilot involving eight patients led to a full 11-month trial of 56 adults, aged roughly 20 to 45, randomly assigned to two groups. All received the same five-drug regimen: a drug that prevents nausea and vomiting, a sedative, fentanyl, propofol and a muscle relaxant. Both groups wore noise-cancelling headphones - but only one heard music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We asked patients to select from two calming instrumental pieces - soft flute or piano," says Dr Husain. "The unconscious mind still has areas that remain active. Even if the music isn't explicitly recalled, implicit awareness can lead to beneficial effects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;A pilot involving eight patients led to a full trial of 56 adults randomly assigned to two groups &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The results were striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Patients exposed to music required lower doses of propofol and fentanyl. They experienced smoother recoveries, lower cortisol or stress-hormone levels and a much better control of blood pressure during the surgery. "Since the ability to hear remains intact under anaesthesia," the researchers write, "music can still shape the brain's internal state."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Clearly, music seemed to quieten the internal storm. "The auditory pathway remains active even when you're unconscious," says Dr Wadhawan. "You may not remember the music, but the brain registers it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The idea that the mind behind the anaesthetic veil is not entirely silent has long intrigued scientists. Rare cases of "intraoperative awareness" show patients recalling fragments of operating-room conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If the brain is capable of picking up and remembering stressful experiences during surgery - even when a patient is unconscious - then it might also be able to register positive or comforting experiences, like music, even without conscious memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We're only beginning to explore how the unconscious mind responds to non-pharmacological interventions like music," says Dr Husain. "It's a way of humanising the operating room."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Music therapy is not new to medicine; it has long been used in psychiatry, stroke rehabilitation and palliative care. But its entry into the intensely technical, machine-governed world of anaesthesia marks a quiet shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If such a simple intervention can reduce drug use and speed recovery - even modestly - it could reshape how hospitals think about surgical wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;As the research team prepares its next study exploring music-aided sedation, building on earlier findings, one truth is already humming through the data: even when the body is still and the mind asleep, it appears a few gentle notes can help the healing begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 00:00:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9HWXl4a3FROU5CUFhKOGtCQ1lrWGVSMlZieVZJR3ZjQl9Da2VWUFU4TXdVcTVyS1RCTG5malB1WUtTREJNOUxkS1FnMFNZNTBCcWs2MlZXWldpQdIBX0FVX3lxTE93UlRJRGgxVFFGRmt3aTFwcldZTFdiLU04RjBmSW5qUlhOcmgxRldhNks5SndyWDF6dmpMZ0lTdW5QZkoycE80dFV2Mk1xTjhIOE1RVlhuVTBrVld5dG1z</guid></item><item><title>科学家实现了可能使电池过时的突破： “每天24小时生成” -冷却</title><link>https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/osmotic-power-plant-scaling-up-blue-energy-france/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;
					
&lt;p&gt;Just as green energy stocks are beginning to rally, French researchers made an important breakthrough in "blue energy," according to the Institut Polytechnique de Paris' &lt;a href="https://www.polytechnique-insights.com/en/columns/energy/osmotic-energy-an-asset-for-the-planet/" target="_blank"&gt;Polytechnique insights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, blue energy isn't as well-known or developed as other forms of &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tag/clean-energy/" target="_blank"&gt;clean energy&lt;/a&gt;, like solar and wind. But the outcome of a pilot project in France "could be decisive for the energy transition," the outlet predicted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Blue energy" is actually a form of &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/" target="_blank"&gt;green energy&lt;/a&gt;. As its moniker implies, the energy in this equation is derived from water. Also called "osmotic power," the process harnesses energy naturally generated at the interface between &lt;a href="https://www.surfertoday.com/environment/the-fresh-water-meets-sea-water-natural-phenomenon" target="_blank"&gt;freshwater and saltwater&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.electrochem.org/what-is-blue-energy" target="_blank"&gt;Electrochemical Society&lt;/a&gt; explained that the innate "pressure" between high-salinity water and freshwater "can be turned into electricity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-144cb76147bc62492e41ef905134cf76 theco-biolite-woah-widget" id="theco-144cb76147bc62492e41ef905134cf76"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-0fd3ebd3abb20c37ba7e77361001dd18 theco-rewiring-america-widget-woah" id="theco-0fd3ebd3abb20c37ba7e77361001dd18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-ef29fb443a218f95997fae527d14a163 theco-saveon-energy-widget-programmatic" id="theco-ef29fb443a218f95997fae527d14a163"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-f0c0b1d50ad21f9a8149a6b5a1a9876e theco-trashie-widget-woah" id="theco-f0c0b1d50ad21f9a8149a6b5a1a9876e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-bb9f9f3278b7daf93b60584821018326 theco-recurrent-woah-widget" id="theco-bb9f9f3278b7daf93b60584821018326"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-e53d075d3331eb785d822308d96d87e8 theco-greenportfolio-woah" id="theco-e53d075d3331eb785d822308d96d87e8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-36ce3179e1407b2920ad40614e9cb7e7 theco-energysage-heat-pump-programmatic" id="theco-36ce3179e1407b2920ad40614e9cb7e7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"The planet naturally makes salt water and fresh water, so we should take advantage of that. It's free energy," ECS Vice Chair Andrew Herring &lt;a href="https://www.electrochem.org/what-is-blue-energy" target="_blank"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-4853e53726ae155fdabbf786525bf9d0 theco-nolan-interior-permalink" id="theco-4853e53726ae155fdabbf786525bf9d0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Estuaries and deltas are both junctures where freshwater bodies, such as rivers, meet saltwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="theco-inline-advertorial theco-target" id="theco-838899481" data-theco-trackid="627859" data-theco-trackbid="1"&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Their work takes place in the Rhône delta, where the Rhône flows into the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Electricity from osmotic energy can be generated 24 hours a day, regardless of weather conditions," Polytechnique insights noted, adding that the infrastructure for osmotic power plants was straightforward compared to similar structures like hydraulic dams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-42ae0056d36b5fef6504cf08e11874bf theco-recurrent-2-woah-widget" id="theco-42ae0056d36b5fef6504cf08e11874bf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Polytechnique insights, Mottet and Bocquet's start-up, Sweetch Energy, commissioned an osmotic power plant capable of generating 4 terawatt-hours (or 1 billion kilowatt-hours) of electricity per year in late 2023. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In March, &lt;a href="https://earth.org/osmotic-power-the-next-wave-of-renewable-energy/" target="_blank"&gt;Earth.org&lt;/a&gt; covered Sweetch Energy's efforts to make osmotic power more accessible within the renewables landscape. The site stated that the duo's breakthroughs could make blue energy a "truly energy-efficient and cost-effective solution" at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="theco-10th-p-carousel theco-target" id="theco-2609309450" data-theco-trackid="603827" data-theco-trackbid="1"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/install-solar-panels/" target="_blank"&gt;installing solar panels&lt;/a&gt; remains the best way for most homeowners to &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/lower-your-utility-bills/" target="_blank"&gt;lower utility bills&lt;/a&gt; as clean energy becomes more accessible and affordable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tag/solar-panels/" target="_blank"&gt;Solar panels&lt;/a&gt; can bring household energy bills to &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-home/reddit-solar-panels-negative-bill-home/" target="_blank"&gt;$0 or even lower&lt;/a&gt;, and TCD's &lt;a href="http://links.thecooldown.com/solar-explorer/" target="_blank"&gt;Solar Explorer&lt;/a&gt; is a tool that simplifies the process. It matches consumers with competitive quotes from vetted local installers, helping you save up to $10,000 on new installations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-306cf70f7910a407d537b1925cca4b33 theco-ad-after-12th-p" id="theco-306cf70f7910a407d537b1925cca4b33"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, solar panels have reduced lifetime energy costs but have required upfront investments. The &lt;a href="http://links.thecooldown.com/solar-explorer/" target="_blank"&gt;Solar Explorer&lt;/a&gt; offers options for all budgets, including Palmetto's &lt;a href="https://links.thecooldown.com/lightreach-home/" target="_blank"&gt;LightReach&lt;/a&gt; solar leasing program, which lets customers lock in low energy rates with no money down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, experts predict that osmotic energy could provide power sufficient to cover "15% of global electricity needs." Mottet and Bocquet believe it could significantly alter the energy landscape by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, researchers have studied both their prevalence in the environment and their impact on it, wildlife, and human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Previous studies have linked microplastics and heart disease. The new research, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412025006890#ak005" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Environment International;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Environment International&lt;/a&gt;, drilled down on that connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers studied the effects of microplastics on mice, exposing them to daily levels equivalent to standard human exposure. They determined microplastics "dramatically worsened atherosclerosis" in several of the mice — but only male subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/atherosclerosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Atherosclerosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt; is the medical term for debris, like fats, that accumulate on artery walls, and the press release indicated microplastics exposure worsened that buildup by "63% in the aortic root" and "624% in the brachiocephalic artery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why are these findings concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To say something "is everywhere" is typically understood to be &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hyperbole" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hyperbole;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;hyperbole&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the unfortunate case of the relatively novel problem of microplastics, it's not an exaggeration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Microplastics were first discovered by a marine biologist, leading scientists to discover that the oceans are awash in this pervasive form of plastic pollution. However, they're also in the soil, which in turn contaminates the food we grow and the meat we consume. They're also airborne, meaning we breathe microplastic-tainted air indoors and out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If microplastics were harmless, this pollution would still be a problem — but in addition to heart disease, traces of the contaminant have been found in human reproductive systems, and research has linked exposure to microplastics to certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"As microplastic pollution continues to rise worldwide, understanding its impacts on human health — including heart disease — is becoming more urgent than ever," said lead author Changcheng Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Research into microplastics is indeed critical, and new information on how microplastics affect the environment and living organisms is routinely studied and published — but acting on these findings on a global scale takes time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Individuals can take several steps to reduce their direct exposure to microplastics, even if, as Zhou observed, it is "nearly impossible to avoid microplastics completely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He advised &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:using less plastic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;using less plastic&lt;/a&gt;, particularly &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/avoid-single-use-items-when-you-travel/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:single-use plastic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;single-use plastic&lt;/a&gt; items, and replacing your most-used things with &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/choose-plastic-free-options-for-everyday-products" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plastic-free alternatives;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;plastic-free alternatives&lt;/a&gt; is also effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Zhou also recommended avoiding plastic water bottles, a major source of microplastic exposure, as well as eschewing &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/ditch-plastic-food-containers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plastic food containers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;plastic food containers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;��&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Get TCD's &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/newsletter/?utm_source=recmzM3sLgAlJogC6" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletters&lt;/a&gt; for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive &lt;a href="https://links.thecooldown.com/rewards-club" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rewards Club;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Rewards Club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 23:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOVWhuTjk5c0NBbVdkdEJtNU5UQ0RVNFdxSTFZM3U4WXJVeEtGbi15TmlKQmdZa01tLVNVTjJRUmEyRVFzTVRLa0xJTEszZ0JsUVhSQkp1X1lIcWJWalJ4dHFZQkdic203emtDM2RLd1l1RWhBcHlpWjJRVGFBeGkyN2JLd1NhSkp6ejJZZU9CWmJxNGwx</guid></item><item><title>世博会在短暂停机后实施EHV安全措施- KDRV</title><link>https://www.kdrv.com/news/jackson-county-expo-equine-facilities-closed-following-state-order/article_7164941e-e85e-4e33-8b12-36ba33a3ec7f.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;CENTRAL POINT, Ore. -- Following a short shutdown earlier this week, the equine facilities at the Jackson County Expo temporarily closed after the Oregon Department of Agriculture issued a Temporary Administrative Order responding to a multistate outbreak of equine herpesvirus (EHV).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closure, effective immediately, initially halted all horse-related activities at the venue. The Expo posted the announcement on its official Facebook page, emphasizing that the decision was made to prioritize the safety and well-being of animals, participants, and the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this time, we are awaiting further guidance from the Oregon Department of Agriculture so we can determine the most appropriate and responsible path forward,” the post said. “We will provide an update when we hear from them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The temporary order, officially titled Temporary Administrative Order Including Statement of Need &amp;amp; Justification DOA 26-2025, Chapter 603, was filed on Nov. 19 and will remain in effect through May 17, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order establishes requirements for equine exhibitions to mitigate the risk of EHV and outlines protocols to prevent the introduction or spread of the virus at facilities across Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ODA order states that immediate action is necessary because exposed horses have already dispersed across multiple states, making it critical to strengthen protections while permanent rulemaking is pursued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rules require additional safeguards for horses entering the state or attending high-risk events, including monitoring health, maintaining records, and establishing isolation procedures if animals show signs of illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the order, the Expo has implemented a new check-in process to allow safe operations. Individual riders can sign up for personal sessions at the Isola Arena gate, while organizers of closed-group practices, including OHSET teams and 4-H groups, must complete a check-in form and submit it to Expo operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Expo said these measures will help monitor hygiene and animal health and allow for a rapid response in the event of an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open riding remains permitted under the new rules, and group practices are allowed as long as standard health and safety protocols are followed. The Expo encouraged riders to remain vigilant about their horses’ health and to report any concerns promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
