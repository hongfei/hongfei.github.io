According to Market Research Future, that number is projected to rise to $2.6billion by 2034.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the number of Americans &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14905141/I-diagnosed-IBS-20-discovered-devastating-truth-decades-later.html"&gt;searching online for information&lt;/a&gt; on hemorrhoids increased five-fold &lt;span&gt;between 2004 and 2023, a DailyMail.com analysis of Google Trends found.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hemorrhoids can be caused by many things, including straining during bowel movements, constipation, heavy lifting, sitting for long periods of time and pregnancy, but experts are increasingly pointing to phone use in the bathroom as a major culprit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A 2021 survey revealed about three-quarters of Americans bring their phones with them into the bathroom. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, this jumped to nearly all respondents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This phone use extends the time you are sitting on the toilet, and prolonged sitting leads to &lt;/span&gt;increased pressure on the veins in the anus and lower rectum, which can cause them to swell and become inflamed, causing hemorrhoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A poor diet or lack of fiber, which 95 percent of Americans do not get enough of in their diet, may also be contributing, as not enough fiber and dehydration can lead to constipation and straining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The number of people suffering from painful and disruptive hemorrhoids is growing, doctors say, with the modern lifestyle likely to blame&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new survey out of the Beth &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/israel-hamas-conflict/index.html" id="mol-41da98c0-6d58-11f0-a75e-d1b7896cbfdc" class=""&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; Deaconess Medical Center in Boston found that people who use their phones on the toilet face a 46 percent increased risk for hemorrhoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hemorrhoids, also called piles, are swollen veins in your anus and lower rectum, similar to varicose veins.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may develop inside the rectum (internal hemorrhoids) or under the skin around the anus (external hemorrhoids).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly three out of four adults will have hemorrhoids at some point in their lives, according to The Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include blood in your stool, persistent discomfort, and a feeling of incomplete evacuation when having a bowel movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In more severe cases, sufferers may notice a lump in or around the anus, which may be tender or cause pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rectal prolapse, which occurs when the rectum slips out of its normal position, potentially through the anus, is a condition similar to hemorrhoids and the two can be confused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the symptoms are slightly different, with the most common complaints being constipation, itching, pain and bleeding in the rectum and mucus discharge in the stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most cases of hemorrhoids can be managed with lifestyle changes, over-the-counter treatments or minor procedures, rectal prolapse typically requires more intensive medical intervention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In both cases, prevention is far preferable to cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recent survey from Beth Israel, presented at the Digestive Diseases Week (DDW) conference in San Diego, considered 125 participants who were receiving a colonoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 40 percent had a hemorrhoid, and 93 percent said they used their phone on the toilet at least once a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About half that group said they read news on the toilet, whereas about 44 percent said they were on social media, and about 30 percent were emailing or texting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2021 survey revealed about three-quarters of Americans bring their phones with them into the bathroom. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, this jumped to nearly all respondents &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, 66 percent of respondents used smartphones while on the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority (93 percent) of those used a smartphone on the toilet at least one to two times per week or more, and more than half (55 percent) used it most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smartphone use on the toilet was associated with a 46 percent increased risk for hemorrhoids after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, exercise activity, and fiber intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants who used smartphones on the toilet spent significantly more time there than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than a third (37 percent) of them spent more than six minutes per bathroom visit on the toilet compared with seven percent of nonusers, and 35 percent said they believed they spent more time on the toilet because of their smartphone use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2021 study found 73 percent of people bring their phone with them into the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This number climbed further when it came to younger people aged 18 to 29, with 93 percent of this age group admitting to using their phones on the toilet, regardless of gender. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although there is no universally agreed 'safe' length of time to spend on the toilet, most gastroenterologists agree that if a bowel movement doesn't happen within five to 10 minutes, it's best to get up, move around and try again later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Going for a short walk or gently moving the body can help stimulate bowel motility naturally, without the need to strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors often refer to the Bristol Stool Chart in clinical practice to assess the health of a person's bowel movements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dietary habits also play a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Low-fiber diets, dehydration and a sedentary lifestyle can all contribute to constipation and harder stools, which increase the likelihood of straining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors recommend eating more fiber-rich foods such as fruit, vegetables, beans and whole grains, as well as drinking plenty of water throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical activity, even just light daily movement, can also improve digestion and reduce the chances of constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for technology in the bathroom, Dr Farah Monzur, director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center at Stony Brook Medicine in New York, said keeping phones and reading material out of the bathroom may be one of the simplest and most effective ways to change toilet habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Monzur said that going to the toilet should be treated as a functional event rather than an opportunity to catch up on emails or social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You don't want to go with the mindset that you'll be there for a long time,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because then you'll want to bring something to keep your mind occupied, and that's what encourages this extended sitting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Make sitting on the toilet as uninteresting as possible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-c1c17bb0-6d41-11f0-baa0-ddf392a808dc" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14954695/habit-fueling-surge-hemorrhoids-phone-toilet.html"&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="120" data-end="243"&gt;Let’s be real: aging is inevitable—but looking and feeling vibrant as the years roll by? That’s something we can influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="245" data-end="521"&gt;We all know someone who seems to defy the rules of time. Maybe it’s your friend’s mom who looks like their older sister. Or that skincare YouTuber who’s pushing 50 but could easily pass for 30. While genetics certainly play a role, lifestyle habits often do the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="523" data-end="777"&gt;As someone who’s spent countless hours sampling vegan collagen snacks and decoding what kombucha brews say about your gut health, I’ve come to appreciate how much our daily rituals shape how we age—not just inside, but in our skin, our posture, our glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="779" data-end="909"&gt;So if you’re looking to maintain that youthful spark—whether you’re 28 or 58—here are 7 habits it might be time to say goodbye to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="If you want to look and feel younger in 60 days, say goodbye to these 7 habits" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfC9c6cD9hk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="916" data-end="966"&gt;1. &lt;strong data-start="923" data-end="966"&gt;Neglecting Your Sleep Like It’s a Trend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="968" data-end="1020"&gt;Sleep isn’t a luxury—it’s a regenerative powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1022" data-end="1213"&gt;Every night you cut short your rest, you’re essentially delaying your body’s natural repair cycle. That means slower collagen production, less skin hydration, and more pronounced fine lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1215" data-end="1381"&gt;I get it—those 2AM deep dives into K-drama fan theories or scrolling through ‘90s shoegaze vinyl on eBay can be irresistible. But your skin (and brain) pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1383" data-end="1641"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1383" data-end="1394"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="1394" data-end="1397"&gt;Commit to 7–9 hours of sleep and protect it like your favorite playlist. Dim the lights an hour before bed. Trade late-night screens for a relaxing wind-down routine—maybe a reishi hot cocoa, a journal entry, or some lo-fi beats and breathwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="1648" data-end="1701"&gt;2. &lt;strong data-start="1655" data-end="1701"&gt;Eating Like You’re Still in Your Dorm Room&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1703" data-end="1894"&gt;Let’s talk diet. If your daily intake still revolves around processed snacks, sugary drinks, and takeout fries—your skin and organs might be aging faster than your birth certificate suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1896" data-end="2083"&gt;These foods create chronic inflammation, spike insulin, and reduce your body’s natural ability to repair oxidative damage. Translation: more wrinkles, duller skin, and a tired appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2085" data-end="2248"&gt;As someone who’s reviewed more vegan snacks than I can count, I can confirm: there are nutrient-rich options out there that taste amazing and support glowing skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2250" data-end="2512"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2250" data-end="2261"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="2261" data-end="2264"&gt;Nourish your body with vibrant whole foods. Think rainbow salads, fermented goodies like kimchi, and omega-rich bites like walnuts and chia seeds. Antioxidants—especially from berries, leafy greens, and green tea—are your best friends in this game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="2519" data-end="2568"&gt;3. &lt;strong data-start="2526" data-end="2568"&gt;Treating Skincare Like an Afterthought&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2570" data-end="2715"&gt;No shame if your routine used to consist of a 3-in-1 body wash. But if you want to look fresh in your 40s and beyond, now’s the time to level up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2717" data-end="2873"&gt;UV exposure, pollution, and stress all speed up skin aging. A minimalist but consistent skincare routine can go a long way in preserving your youthful glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2875" data-end="3097"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2875" data-end="2886"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="2886" data-end="2889"&gt;Start with a good cleanser, moisturizer, and SPF. (Yes, SPF—even on cloudy days, even if you’re just inside working by a window.) Bonus points for a gentle exfoliant and a serum with vitamin C or niacinamide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3099" data-end="3199"&gt;And no, your skincare doesn’t need to cost as much as a front-row concert ticket—just be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="3206" data-end="3258"&gt;4. &lt;strong data-start="3213" data-end="3258"&gt;Dismissing Hydration Like It’s a Buzzword&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3260" data-end="3432"&gt;Dehydration isn’t just about feeling thirsty. It’s also about what happens to your skin, organs, and metabolism when you’re not giving your body enough water to do its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3434" data-end="3517"&gt;Dry, flaky skin? Sunken eyes? Lackluster energy? All signs you might need more H2O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3519" data-end="3756"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3519" data-end="3530"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="3530" data-end="3533"&gt;Start your morning with a tall glass of water (bonus: add lemon and sea salt for electrolytes). Sip throughout the day—not just when you’re parched. Herbal teas and water-rich fruits like cucumbers and watermelon also help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3758" data-end="3871"&gt;And maybe, just maybe, trade one of those extra iced lattes for a refreshing green juice or a hibiscus cold brew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="3878" data-end="3925"&gt;5. &lt;strong data-start="3885" data-end="3925"&gt;Stressing Like It’s a Badge of Honor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3927" data-end="4186"&gt;We live in a culture that glamorizes the hustle—but chronic stress literally breaks down your body’s youth-preserving mechanisms. It increases cortisol, which accelerates collagen loss, dehydrates the skin, and even shrinks your brain over time (not kidding).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4188" data-end="4377"&gt;As someone who’s juggled deadlines, creative blocks, and the chaos of launching a podcast about vegan food trends—I know how tempting it is to normalize the pressure. But peace is powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4379" data-end="4630"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4379" data-end="4390"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="4390" data-end="4393"&gt;Make space for joy and decompression. Meditate, go for walks, listen to music that fills you up (might I suggest the latest Men I Trust release?), or try journaling. Protect your nervous system like it’s the last kombucha scoby on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="4637" data-end="4696"&gt;6. &lt;strong data-start="4644" data-end="4696"&gt;Forgetting to Move Your Body (Beyond the Scroll)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4698" data-end="4919"&gt;Movement isn't just about aesthetics—it’s about circulation, posture, and mood. A sedentary lifestyle slows your metabolism, reduces lymphatic drainage (read: puffiness), and contributes to that sluggish, “older” feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4921" data-end="5035"&gt;You don’t need to become a CrossFit warrior to reap the benefits. Just find movement that sparks something in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5037" data-end="5251"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5037" data-end="5048"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="5048" data-end="5051"&gt;Dance. Stretch. Bike to your local farmers market. Take the stairs. Join a beginner K-pop dance class just for the fun of it (yes, you can). The key is to get your blood flowing and your body aligned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5253" data-end="5352"&gt;When you move regularly, it shows—especially in the bounce in your step and the light in your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="5359" data-end="5425"&gt;7. &lt;strong data-start="5366" data-end="5425"&gt;Holding On to Negativity Like It’s Your Favorite Hoodie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5427" data-end="5523"&gt;This might sound woo-woo, but hear me out: your mental and emotional state affects how you look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5525" data-end="5727"&gt;People who hold onto resentment, complain constantly, or stay locked in pessimism often carry it in their face, their energy, and even their body language. It’s like a shadow dulling your natural shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5729" data-end="5829"&gt;Ever notice how people who radiate joy seem to glow, regardless of their age? That’s no coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5831" data-end="6055"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5831" data-end="5842"&gt;Fix it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="5842" data-end="5845"&gt;Practice gratitude—even if it’s just one thing a day. Release what doesn’t serve you. Surround yourself with people who uplift you. Laugh more. Forgive quicker. Let go of the old stories that wrinkle your soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6062" data-end="6101"&gt;Final Thoughts: Glow Is a Lifestyle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6103" data-end="6279"&gt;Staying youthful isn’t about Botox or miracle serums—it’s about the choices we make every day. From what we eat to how we rest to how we treat ourselves when no one’s watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6281" data-end="6442"&gt;I’ll leave you with this: Aging is a privilege. But showing up for yourself in a way that lets you age with vitality and style? That’s a flex worth striving for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6444" data-end="6619"&gt;So go ahead—ditch the habits that drag you down. Drink your water, take that dance class, eat your fermented tofu snack, and wear sunscreen like it’s part of your personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6621" data-end="6653"&gt;Your future self will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wisdom comes with age. But flexibility? It feels like we lose a little limberness every year — and that can come with some (*ahem*) stiff consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just that you can’t do the splits or touch your toes like you used to. Having tighter muscles can affect your ability to navigate day-to-day life, something you may have already started to feel if you have a job that requires a lot of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there’s one easy thing you can do to combat this: stretch your hip flexors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all types of stretches are good for your body, focusing on your hip flexors is especially important to maintain mobility as you get older. Tight hip flexors can cause lower back pain and muscle fatigue and stretching them can improve balance and resolve other issues, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7922112/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916072" data-affiliate="true"&gt;a 2021 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fyzical.com/fort-myers-fl/About/Staff" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916072" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Gavin Hamer&lt;/a&gt;, a physical therapist and the national director of clinical education at &lt;a href="https://www.fyzical.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916072" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Fyzical Therapy &amp;amp; Balance Centers&lt;/a&gt;, told HuffPost that “stretching will positively affect the joints, ligaments, and muscles around the hip.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Flexible muscles are less likely to become strained, and mobile joints are kept healthy by improving circulation and lubrication,” Hamer added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, flexible hips lead to “greater stride length and more effective reactions to balance challenges,” according to Hamer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Do We Lose Flexibility? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

At this appointment, she also got Dysport, which is similar to Botox, for the first time.  Both injectables are formulated from the toxin that causes botulism to paralyze the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately after her appointment, Wolaver claims she developed a migraine. The next day, she went to the hospital when she “couldn't function or string sentences together,” Wolaver, who hails from Good Hope, said, according to&lt;em&gt; Daily Mail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda Wolaver / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Amanda Wolaver says her health struggle began after getting injections to combat wrinkles.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;PEOPLE has reached out to Abbievie, the manufacturer of Botox, and Galderma, the manufacturer of Dysport, for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CT scan showed “nothing to do with the injection,” but her condition worsened, she said. Strong smells bothered her; She got dizzy quickly and relied heavily on her husband, Josh, 39, to care for their three children: Landen, 16, Braxton, 11, and Havyn, 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I couldn't be the mother I wanted for my three children,” said Wolaver, who struggled to walk, drive, and even move — leading her to think she was “slowly dying.” Doctors suspected multiple sclerosis or an autoimmune disorder. She had spinal taps and even a heart monitor implanted to diagnose the cause of her illness. It was only after she spent some time in an online forum that she learned what a possible source of her illness. After spending approximately $30,000 on tests, Wolaver learned she’d been having mini-strokes caused by iatrogenic &lt;a href="https://people.com/pesto-botulism-outbreak-6-people-sick-8710857" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:botulism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;botulism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iatrogenic means an illness that comes from a medical procedure. Botulism is a rare but serious illness that’s generally caused by food tainted by the toxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum. Botox is formulated from this same toxin, but as the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/botox/about/pac-20384658" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; says, is purified and meets medical control standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Botulism can occur after Botox “when the toxin circulates in the blood and produces effects remotely from the injection site,” the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00507.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:U.S. Centers for Disease Control;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; explained after a 2024 outbreak of botulism from Botox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda Wolaver / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Amanda Wolaver says she thought she was "slowly dying" until she paid out-of-pocket for tests that said she had botulism.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of botulism may start within a few hours, and include trouble swallowing or speaking, nausea, trouble breathing, and blurred vision, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/prevention/home-canned-foods.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. “Recovery may take months and typically involves extended rehabilitation therapy,” the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/botulism/symptoms-causes/syc-20370262" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; says. While antitoxins may help, they “can't reverse damage that's already been done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding out she’d had botulism, she said, “knocked me back. To be told I had suffered from multiple small strokes in my brain made me think that this would eventually kill me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an effort to speed her recovery along, she’s changed her diet and even had her implants removed, hoping it’ll detoxify her body. As Wolaver says, “I learned the cost of beauty the hard way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the pond, the UK is currently experiencing an outbreak of botulism, with 38 cases linked to Botox, the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ukhsa-issues-warning-over-botulism" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/georgia-mom-paralyzed-botox-dysport-botulism-stroke-11782023" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 21:18:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE92RDFWWndfS1RUN1RqZG83WmNMdkhUOVg0aHE1RXpxdnJXSFVTTGtyTWFOTDJHWVF5eEZDOTB4dTZEVFQxT0ExdWhOVEh3ZDEwcUZja2M5V0x0Z0tlN1djeWJfRWMwVUlKWUtvVm0wdEI</guid></item><item><title>根据一份新报告，一种类型的HPV已被发现可导致皮肤癌- NBC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxQRjN5SzhHMDdvTkFBSHloektKbTNaTFFPbFowalBqS1JsUUtJeDZzak5sX3ZLT0pHT2p4cHFlZEtDV3RnMXpqN2RWSXVhWGN5UE9lVDM5YmsxR2pKYjlCMEUwSXFoOEtjT0ttVWE2ZmNGWjNwbnNWTk1NVjRmcE5xNEdNVWp2QlRNLW42MHhFSjJpYmRjR1E0bXhlSC3SAVZBVV95cUxPaGdDVHNndjhsTmFDUHNZSmJYeHRPT1hLTUlDaWM0NVlHOTVYT0JxVXVGWkNUZEFUbzZBbXFKeVRVNk13SFM1dVRhSGR2NDlXYmxtNVd3UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cd5354" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors at the National Institutes of Health have discovered a new cause of skin cancer, according to a case report published Wednesday in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502114" target="_blank"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ff3849" class="body-graf"&gt;The culprit is a type of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/hpv-vaccine-significantly-lowers-risk-cervical-cancer-large-study-finds-n1241600" target="_blank"&gt;human papillomavirus (HPV)&lt;/a&gt; that’s regularly found on the skin. It’s long been thought to play a role in the development of skin cancer, but wasn’t believed to be a direct cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-00deca" class="body-graf"&gt;Skin cancer is caused by DNA damage in skin cells. The most common source of that damage is ultraviolet radiation from the sun. HPV can help UV-damaged DNA build up in cells and turn cancerous. However, in the new case report, doctors found that the virus itself could cause cancerous lesions to form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f7e615" class="body-graf"&gt;The discovery was made in a 34-year-old woman with a weakened immune system; experts said it’s highly unlikely that HPV could play the same role in causing skin cancer in a person with a healthy immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a009e9" class="body-graf"&gt;“The virus replicated in a somewhat uncontrolled manner and ended up integrating into the skin cells and once they did that, they became cancerous,” said Dr. Andrea Lisco, section chief of the  mucosal and cutaneous viral immunopathogenesis unit at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the NIH. Lisco was the woman’s doctor and also the senior author of the case report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-acb1a6" class="body-graf"&gt;The woman had 43 spots of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma — the second-most common type of skin cancer, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-groundbreaking-treatment-advanced-melanoma-rcna138005" target="_blank"&gt;after melanoma&lt;/a&gt; —  on her face, hands and legs. She had surgery to remove the cancers and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/jimmy-carter-drug-immunotherapy-melanoma-rcna153166" target="_blank"&gt;immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt;, but the cancer returned. When Lisco and his team biopsied several of her new tumors, they found that the woman’s skin cancer was being driven by something they hadn’t seen before: a group of HPVs called beta HPV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f214c4" class="body-graf"&gt;About &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2019.00355/full" target="_blank"&gt;90% of people&lt;/a&gt; carry a strain of beta HPV. Usually, the virus lives on the skin and doesn’t integrate into the DNA of skin cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1dcb85" class="body-graf"&gt;“We shake hands and we pick up those viruses, but if our immune systems are under control, we are fine,” Lisco said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-45d028" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s a different group of HPV strains — alpha HPVs — that are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/hpv-can-cause-cancer-many-people-dont-realize-rcna79597" target="_blank"&gt;linked to a range of cancers&lt;/a&gt;. Alpha HPVs live on mucus membranes and can integrate into DNA, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-hpv-increasing-women-vaccine-safe-rcna196439" target="_blank"&gt;causing cancers of the cervix&lt;/a&gt;, anus, head and neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-325ff8" class="body-graf"&gt;The woman in the case report had a genetic condition that weakened her T-cells (a type of immune cell), leaving her immunocompromised. This allowed the beta HPV living on her skin to behave more like alpha HPV, integrating its DNA into her skin cells and replicating undisturbed, turning the cells cancerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-451f9c" class="body-graf"&gt;“You don’t know how much you can directly apply the information from one patient to the wide variety of patients,” said Dr. Anthony Oro, professor of dermatology at Stanford Medicine, who wasn’t involved in the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-01cc80" class="body-graf"&gt;However, “it suggests that, in the event that the T-cell arm of the immune system is not doing its job, beta-type HPV viruses could contribute to skin cancer, and maybe other kinds of cancers as well,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c8a450" class="body-graf"&gt;The patient needed a stem cell transplant, which replaced her defective T-cells with T-cells that could prevent the HPV from replicating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-853c5f" class="body-graf"&gt;“We needed to give this patient a whole new immune system,” Lisco said. It worked. Three years post-transplant, the woman’s skin cancer has not returned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-976fd6" class="body-graf"&gt;“It gives us good information about how the interplay of the HPV and the immune system works,” said Dr. Anthony Rossi, a dermatologist and Mohs surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who also wasn’t involved with the woman’s case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ae22f" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors have known for a long time that some beta HPVs cause changes on the skin, such as warts on the hands and feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-638f59" class="body-graf"&gt;“HPV can integrate and cause changes in the cell cycle, especially in people with suppressed immune systems,” Rossi said. “What was novel about this is that they found out it was a beta HPV that integrated into the DNA.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_small__gIJ9M" id="anchor-f77068"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1800"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1240px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-360w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-360w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-320w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-320w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 758px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250730-Squamous-cell-carcinoma-mn-1410-d3407e.jpg" alt="Squamous cell carcinoma"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Squamous cell carcinoma of the upper lip in a 50-year-old woman. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;BSIP / Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-69a14b" class="body-graf"&gt;Other researchers have speculated this was a possibility based on studies in mice, but the new report shows that it can occur in humans.

Lisco said that the original notion — that HPV passively contributes to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma by helping UV radiation damage skin cells, but doesn’t actively help cancer grow — is still the likely explanation for many people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-24b12c" class="body-graf"&gt;For them, “protection from UV would be the prevention,” Lisco said — wearing sunscreen and covering up your skin from the sun — adding that immunocompromised people should be monitored more closely. People with weakened immune systems are as much as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11430974/" target="_blank"&gt;100 times more likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop squamous cell carcinoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2f7cf" class="body-graf"&gt;The Gardasil HPV vaccine protects against nine strains of alpha HPV and has been shown to lower rates of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/hpv-vaccine-benefits-exceed-expectations-may-lead-elimination-cervical-cancer-n1022206" target="_blank"&gt;cervical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hpv-vaccine-linked-lower-rates-head-neck-cancer-males-study-finds-rcna153759" target="_blank"&gt;head and neck cancers&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear how much cross-protection, if any, the vaccine provides against other strains of HPV, including beta HPV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6b35e8" class="body-graf"&gt;“Even if this strain is not in the vaccine, there is some theory that there is cross-talk between HPV strains,” Rossi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-49faf6" class="body-graf"&gt;Most people will get HPV in their lifetimes. Scientists have so far identified about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pinkbook/hcp/table-of-contents/chapter-11-human-papillomavirus.html#:~:text=licensed%20in%202014.-,Human%20Papillomavirus%20(HPV),about%2066%25%20of%20cervical%20cancers." target="_blank"&gt;200 unique&lt;/a&gt; strains of the virus. Alpha-HPV, with its well-established links to cancer, has thus far been the primary subject of research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-09a975" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“This suggests that this other side of the family might also be important in situations where our immune system is not doing its job,” Oro said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 21:01:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQRjN5SzhHMDdvTkFBSHloektKbTNaTFFPbFowalBqS1JsUUtJeDZzak5sX3ZLT0pHT2p4cHFlZEtDV3RnMXpqN2RWSXVhWGN5UE9lVDM5YmsxR2pKYjlCMEUwSXFoOEtjT0ttVWE2ZmNGWjNwbnNWTk1NVjRmcE5xNEdNVWp2QlRNLW42MHhFSjJpYmRjR1E0bXhlSC3SAVZBVV95cUxPaGdDVHNndjhsTmFDUHNZSmJYeHRPT1hLTUlDaWM0NVlHOTVYT0JxVXVGWkNUZEFUbzZBbXFKeVRVNk13SFM1dVRhSGR2NDlXYmxtNVd3UQ</guid></item><item><title>加拿大麻疹病例超过美国，艾伯塔省官员推动紧急状态-纽约时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxNRUhJR0ZyazFucDlhampmZEpBNmpOVlpFOVFlYW42TTJiY1JRU3U4VVNhQ211UVZuZEsxMFFhQW81MTctU1lfdUZIU01wcElzbWxqZUN0SUM0OTV3MHlzaTBha200ejV3bEtPTjdDVnhKUjFrMERJd3NfQnByc3NES2F6RzdWa0hjWUpJWA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 20:25:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNRUhJR0ZyazFucDlhampmZEpBNmpOVlpFOVFlYW42TTJiY1JRU3U4VVNhQ211UVZuZEsxMFFhQW81MTctU1lfdUZIU01wcElzbWxqZUN0SUM0OTV3MHlzaTBha200ejV3bEtPTjdDVnhKUjFrMERJd3NfQnByc3NES2F6RzdWa0hjWUpJWA</guid></item><item><title>睡眠中断会损害大脑血管，并可能增加痴呆风险- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOTHJlc0FHNUs1S2hoaU9jRFFiM3YwVzZpazhPS0hiWC1GSlY1MnhKMGVaLW1HaEZXS2gwM2dYbkp5Q0lRTW03QXpKcWR4N1NoOEhHbmd0d3dzSHFSQlRaSG12Mkk2TkNvMWhSZXBESWFvWnNKcHZ5TFlKT0Z6b3NnSDlVbTRDNzBFYkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study reveals that fragmented sleep causes cellular damage to the brain's blood vessels, providing further evidence to suggest that sleep disruption predisposes the brain to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awaf161/8189044?login=true" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Brain&lt;/i&gt;, is the first to offer cellular and molecular evidence that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sleep+disruption/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sleep disruption&lt;/a&gt; directly causes damage to brain &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+vessels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; and blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that individuals who had more fragmented sleep, such as sleeping restlessly and waking up a lot at night, had a change in their balance of pericytes—a brain blood vessel cell that plays an important role in regulating brain blood flow and the entry and exit of substances between the blood and the brain," said Andrew Lim, principal investigator of the study and a sleep neurologist and scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This in turn was associated with a more rapid decline in cognitive function in the decade leading up to their death."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers applied wearable smartwatch-like sensors to the research subjects—more than 600 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt;—to measure their sleep and used new gene sequencing technologies to measure levels of pericytes in the brain. The research participants subsequently passed away and donated their brains for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that in some individuals, sleep disruption can precede the onset of cognitive impairment by years, with emerging evidence suggesting a bidirectional link between sleep disruption and Alzheimer's disease," adds Lim, who is also an associate professor in the department of medicine in the University of Toronto's Temerty Faculty of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"However, we didn't have sufficient evidence behind the mechanisms underlying these links, until now."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study's findings suggest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep fragmentation may be an important factor leading to brain blood vessel injury&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pericytes may be particularly important in mediating these effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting sleep fragmentation may be a means of improving brain vascular health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting pericytes may be a mechanism of preventing the deleterious effects of sleep fragmentation on brain &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+flow/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood flow&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently on Alzheimer's disease and other dementias&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study raises the possibility that changes in pericytes may be a mechanism linking sleep fragmentation with small vessel disease and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;," says Lim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If confirmed in clinical trials of sleep interventions with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pericyte/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pericyte&lt;/a&gt; biomarker outcomes, Lim adds, "it would highlight that sleep interventions may be an effective means to alter human small vessel biology and cognitive decline, and also raise the possibility that aggressive treatment of other risk factors for cerebral small vessel disease may help prevent the deleterious impact of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sleep+fragmentation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sleep fragmentation&lt;/a&gt; on small vessel biology."&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Department of Health and Human
Services announced Wednesday North Carolina’s first reported case of West Nile
virus in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Officials said the case was found in a Durham County
resident. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Officials have not released the name of the person who
tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control (CDC)&lt;/a&gt; the
West Nile virus is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the
continental United States. The virus is commonly spread to people by the bite
of an infected mosquito. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The CDC said there is no vaccine to prevent or
medicines to treat West Nile in people. The best way to&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/prevention/index.html"&gt; reduce the risk&lt;/a&gt; is to protect
yourself from mosquito bites. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·        
Use insect repellent &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·        
Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;·        
Treat clothing and gear &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·        
Take steps to control mosquitos indoors
and outdoors&lt;/p&gt;

At 44 years old, she thought perimenopause, when the body starts to transition to menopause, was causing her heavy menstrual bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4094ad" class="body-graf"&gt;“Everybody was telling me I’m going through perimenopause,” the now-46-year-old from Valley City, Ohio, tells TODAY.com. “I didn’t make a big deal about it. I just put up with it for another two months. But then I started getting contractions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-229757" class="body-graf"&gt;She visited her doctor and eventually learned that she had Stage 3 cervical cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-369777" class="body-graf"&gt;“I was sad,” Sanders says. “But I didn’t give up.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-98bff5" class="body-heading"&gt;Non-Stop Bleeding With Pain &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d17f8" class="body-graf"&gt;When the constant bleeding began, Sanders listened to others who said perimenopause was likely the cause of her irregular periods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-061799" class="body-graf"&gt;“My mom was like, ‘Melissa, all of us go through it,’” Sanders recalls. “I was like, ‘I don’t know mom because when you were going through this, I don’t remember you being in this much pain.’ And then I was like, ‘There is no way this is just perimenopause.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-a9042d"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1875"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/cervical-cancer-zz-250730-03-d5760a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/cervical-cancer-zz-250730-03-d5760a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/cervical-cancer-zz-250730-03-d5760a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/cervical-cancer-zz-250730-03-d5760a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/cervical-cancer-zz-250730-03-d5760a.jpg" alt="Melissa Sanders often watched her granddaughter as her daughter attended college to become a nurse."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Melissa Sanders often watched her granddaughter as her daughter attended college to become a nurse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Melissa Sanders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cfcadf" class="body-graf"&gt;After several months of heavy, non-stop bleeding, she began experiencing pain that felt like the contractions she remembered from giving birth to her three children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-21be70" class="body-graf"&gt;“It got to where I couldn’t stand at work,” she says. “I was holding my stomach to walk.

She realized that it had been 22 years since her last one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7fba6b" class="body-graf"&gt;“I never worried about me,” Sanders says. “I was a single mom with three kids, and I worked. So, they did their routines, doctors, dentists, but I just never had the time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b00491" class="body-graf"&gt;Soon after her Pap smear, her doctor scheduled a biopsy. But she faced an unexpected complication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e65b91" class="body-graf"&gt;“They stopped my biopsy within two minutes of starting it,” she says. “I had cancerous skin falling off my cervix, just falling off, and there was ooze.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4a7c20" class="body-graf"&gt;The doctor could tell Sanders had a mass by feeling it, and an MRI and PET scan revealed that she had Stage 3 cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f7b3d0" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors recommended chemotherapy and radiation to treat it. For about six months, she underwent treatment. Undergoing grueling therapies took a toll on her health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8d33d2" class="body-graf"&gt;“My son pretty much had to carry (me) around at my last radiation,” Sanders says. “I was really, really weak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ff7b71" class="body-graf"&gt;In September 2024, she finished treatment. While she gradually feels better, Sanders still notices she struggles with weakness and ongoing pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2bae2d" class="body-graf"&gt;“I can’t stand … as long as I was able to before,” she says. “My legs are weak, my hips. That’s just from my waist down. It’s like I've got to gain all my muscles back.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9fa96e" class="body-graf"&gt;She’s in physical therapy to try to improve her strength. Every three months, she has bloodwork done, and she undergoes scans to make sure she’s still cancer free. Since last year, her scans have been clear. While she did not undergo any surgery, her cancer treatments have put her in menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cd7157" class="body-graf"&gt;“My doctor said I won’t have a period for the rest of my life,” she says. “I will have hot flashes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-50651f" class="body-heading"&gt;Cervical Cancer &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-04e6ba" class="body-graf"&gt;Cervical cancer is usually caused by an infection with the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/martina-navratilovas-hpv-turned-cancer-happen-rcna64433" target="_blank"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt; (HPV), which infects about 80% of people at some point in their lives, &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/prevention-screening/manage-your-risk/hpv.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to MD Anderson Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt;. While many people clear the virus from their system, some are not able to, and the virus lingers. About 12 types of HPV are considered high risk and can lead to cervical cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-36a782" class="body-graf"&gt;“One of my colleagues called it the common cold for the vagina,” Dr. Sudha Amarnath, a radiology oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic, tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-dd1c7a"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1944"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/cervical-cancer-zz-250730-04-a1583a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/cervical-cancer-zz-250730-04-a1583a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/cervical-cancer-zz-250730-04-a1583a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/cervical-cancer-zz-250730-04-a1583a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/cervical-cancer-zz-250730-04-a1583a.jpg" alt="Melissa Sanders works as a flagger and felt that she had a difficult time standing because of the pain she experienced from cervical cancer."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Melissa Sanders works as a flagger and felt that she had a difficult time standing because of the pain she experienced from cervical cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Melissa Sanders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7fa1f6" class="body-graf"&gt;While Pap smears and HPV screening can often detect precancerous cells or high-risk HPV infections, many women, like Sanders, do not realize they need to undergo regular screening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a3a1e8" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is something that we see really frequently. A lot of women stop taking care of themselves once they stop having children because they’re so focused on their kids and other people in their lives,” Amarnath says. “We’ve all been exposed to HPV, and so making sure that it’s not causing any precancerous and cancer changes … in our cervix is really important.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-90b541" class="body-graf"&gt;A Pap smear — where doctors take a sample of cervical cells from outside and inside the cervix — is one of the best ways to screen for cervical cancer. They are recommended every three years between the ages of 21-65, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/cervical/screening" target="_blank"&gt;per the National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d37c2a" class="body-graf"&gt;“The goal is to find any changes in those cells ... so you can remove them before they turn into cancer,” Amarnath says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3ec871" class="body-graf"&gt;Signs of cervical cancer include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6b56f1" class="body-graf"&gt;For early-stage cervical cancer, doctors can sometimes remove the affected part of the cervix. But if the tumor is too big or located too deep within the body, doctors might use chemotherapy and radiation instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6016ee" class="body-graf"&gt;The good news about cervical cancer is that it can be avoided. &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/cancer-vaccine-hpv-rcna195393" target="_blank"&gt;The HPV vaccine is 97% effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing HPV-related cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-316d6f" class="body-graf"&gt;“We’d like to scream it from a rooftop — everyone should get the HPV vaccine,” Amarnath says. “It protects against several … strains of high-risk HPV, so it can protect against cervical cancer, vaginal cancer, anal cancer, head and neck cancers for both boys and girls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3f4c36" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Don't Ignore It’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ef00d1" class="body-graf"&gt;When Sanders started treatment for cervical cancer, she had to stop watching her granddaughter, Gracelynn, because Gracelynn’s mom wanted Sanders to have enough time to rest and recover. Not seeing her granddaughter felt tough because it dramatically changed Sanders' daily schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a83c6b" class="body-graf"&gt;“She was with me every day,” she says. “I had her all the time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1ca77e" class="body-graf"&gt;During her treatment, Sanders spent a month away from home. Being away from her family and grappling with a cancer diagnosis felt isolating and depressing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d2ec2c" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was sad,” she says. “I wanted everything to be normal.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-33daf8" class="body-graf"&gt;Since treatment, Sanders started prioritizing her health so she can see Gracelynn grow up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-073868" class="body-graf"&gt;“I got to put me first,” she says. “I try to do everything healthier. I just walked 3 miles the other day with my daughter and grandbaby.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-388ee1" class="body-graf"&gt;Sanders says she hopes that others learn from her experience and do not neglect their cancer screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-849f7b" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“A lot of people have that mindset that life is too busy. But it really isn’t,” she says. “It’s very important to keep up with your Pap smears, mammograms. Don’t ignore it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 19:18:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQdFpnbEY1VWEwSUt1WHEtdTV6bVU3U2hJU2xPR1ZTVkRxZ3lVQ1hENVRkMUtXOEZCandLc1Q2MlB0S2VZbENoX0lELVgyT3N4UmVQWmdrVmRRX0RLVWxFVlMwLW9WUHNxWXhTMk9tNHVHVjJrTlRqdDBmN3ZYZWdldVZyd21hbjZjVl9NU2xLcjl0ZnM10gFUQVVfeXFMUHpPSTZoMWk2SkN6RkNLbEEzZ2taMXRmUDFzLUtJT3Bmdjd1RHhnVTZwNkFZQ1pNZVhkTE8yNVpGV0tIRXFSZWtJNFFQc0FCOE9sajUw</guid></item><item><title>科学家用孔雀羽毛制造该死的激光束- Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxQMHhzVk1xTF9TN1lFM014Zk1NTTZpdWZ6U3d0cjNnUmM0TmNfeTJaOGxiaS1OLVJKWUJkSHdnWk4wa1Y3MUV4bWk1aG9Bb2g5ZVlTWVdUSTg4aW9vdVJXTjhiQUlyZ01nWDNBcnFCa3hxZS1NWDV0V2RpYjBNU25CWXA3LS15RWhoajFrX3ZWczZyT2dNWC0tLXdGd0hHdXl1Vnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;Peacock feathers are greatly admired for their bright iridescent colors, but it turns out they can also emit laser light when dyed multiple times, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-04039-8"&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Scientific Reports. Per the authors, it's the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/peacock-feathers-can-be-lasers"&gt;first example&lt;/a&gt; of a biolaser cavity within the animal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/rainbow-weevil-could-hold-the-secret-to-generating-natures-colors-in-the-lab/"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, the bright iridescent colors in things like peacock feathers and butterfly wings don't come from any pigment molecules but from how they are structured. The scales of chitin (a polysaccharide common to insects) in butterfly wings, for example, are arranged like roof tiles. Essentially, they form a &lt;a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/5783709/the-colorful-story-of-diffraction-grating"&gt;diffraction grating&lt;/a&gt;, except photonic crystals only produce certain colors, or wavelengths, of light, while a diffraction grating will produce the entire spectrum, much like a prism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of peacock feathers, it's the regular, periodic nanostructures of the &lt;a class="mw-redirect" title="Barbule" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbule"&gt;barbules&lt;/a&gt;—fiber-like components composed of ordered melanin rods coated in keratin—that produce the iridescent colors. Different colors correspond to different spacing of the barbules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are naturally occurring examples of what physicists call &lt;a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/shiny-things-an-ode-to-photonic-crystals/"&gt;photonic crystals&lt;/a&gt;. Also known as photonic bandgap materials, photonic crystals are "tunable," which means they are precisely ordered in such a way as to block certain wavelengths of light while letting others through. Alter the structure by changing the size of the tiles, and the crystals become sensitive to a different wavelength. (In fact, the rainbow weevil &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/rainbow-weevil-could-hold-the-secret-to-generating-natures-colors-in-the-lab/"&gt;can control&lt;/a&gt; both the size of its scales and how much chitin is used to fine-tune those colors as needed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better (from an applications standpoint), the perception of color doesn't depend on the viewing angle. And the scales are not just for aesthetics; they help shield the insect from the elements. There are several types of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19547304"&gt;manmade photonic crystals&lt;/a&gt;, but gaining a better and more detailed understanding of how these structures grow in nature could help scientists design new materials with similar qualities, such as iridescent windows, self-cleaning surfaces for cars and buildings, or even waterproof textiles. Paper currency could incorporate encrypted iridescent patterns to foil counterfeiters.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;According to a new study, humans can inhale more than 70,000 microplastic particles each day in an indoor environment – far more than previously thought. Worse still, most of them are small enough to penetrate &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-just-how-far-plastic-can-reach-into-your-lungs"&gt;deep into our lungs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/7000-microplastics-studies-show-we-have-one-really-big-problem"&gt;defining environmental issues&lt;/a&gt; of our time, clogging up everything from our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tiny-crustaceans-fragment-insidious-microplastics-into-even-smaller-nanoplastics"&gt;waterways&lt;/a&gt; to our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-can-block-blood-flow-in-the-brain-study-in-mice-shows"&gt;bloodstreams&lt;/a&gt;. Tiny particles of the stuff enter our bodies not just through what we &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-food-packaging-is-shedding-microplastics-into-every-meal-study-reveals"&gt;eat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-persist-in-drinking-water-despite-treatment-plant-advances"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt; but through the very &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-are-now-spiralling-around-the-globe-in-the-air-we-breathe"&gt;air we breathe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-inhale-a-credit-card-of-plastic-every-week-heres-where-it-goes?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;You Inhale a Credit Card of Plastic Every Week. Here's Where It Goes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, scientists from the Université de Toulouse in France quantified just how much plastic dust we may be inhaling every day. The team took 16 indoor air samples from their own apartments and cars, then analyzed them using a technique called Raman spectroscopy to measure the concentration of microplastics floating around in there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169420" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169420" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/microplastics2-642x355.jpg" alt="Humans Breathe in More Than 70,000 Microplastic Particles Every Day, New Study Suggests" class="wp-image-169420 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/microplastics2-642x355.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/microplastics2-750x415.jpg 750w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/microplastics2-768x425.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/microplastics2-600x332.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/microplastics2.jpg 1095w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169420" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers calculated how many microplastic particles of different sizes humans inhale each day while in an indoor environment.

Of those particles, 94 percent were less than 10 micrometers wide, which is small enough to work their way deep into lung tissue when inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this and other research, the team estimated that adults inhale roughly 71,000 microplastic particles from these environments every single day, with 68,000 of them being sub-10 micrometers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The concentration we found is 100-fold higher than previous extrapolated estimates," the &lt;a href="http://plos.io/4m2xRFM"&gt;authors say&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People spend an average of 90 percent of their time indoors, including homes, workplaces, shops, transportation, etc., and all the while they are exposed to microplastic pollution through inhalation without even thinking about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly what those microplastics get up to once they're in our bodies remains uncertain, but scientists suspect it's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-expert-explains-the-real-dangers-of-microplastics-to-human-health"&gt;nothing good&lt;/a&gt;. Recent studies suggest they could increase the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-suspected-to-cause-fertility-gut-and-lung-issues-warns-new-review"&gt;certain cancers, fertility issues&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-found-in-blood-clots-in-heart-brain-and-legs"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;, and a range of other &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-could-accumulate-in-our-brains-more-than-in-kidneys-and-livers"&gt;health problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is desperately needed to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/toxicologists-urge-for-research-into-the-unknown-health-risks-of-microplastic"&gt;investigate the biological effects of microplastics&lt;/a&gt;, as well as ways we might be able to reduce exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0328011"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;There really might be something to the idea of summertime sadness, at least for boys. A study finds that men born in the summer are more vulnerable to developing depression than men born at other times of the year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Kwantlen Polytechnic University in British Columbia, Canada, conducted the study, an international survey of adults. They found that men, but not women, were more likely to experience depression symptoms later in life if their birth occurred in the summer compared to other seasons. The findings suggest that mothers are exposed to important environmental risk factors that vary throughout the calendar year, the authors say, including levels of sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Study author Mika Mokkonen was inspired to look into this topic by the kind of question you’d get making small talk at a party.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The initial spark of the idea for this research arose when someone asked me if I believed in horoscopes. It got me wondering if there could potentially be a biological basis for them, in terms of how a person’s birthday could be associated with physiological or mental features,” he told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors have long known that seasonality can affect our current mental health—the clearest example being &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/seasonal-affective-disorder"&gt;seasonal affective disorder&lt;/a&gt;, a type of depression that typically emerges during the winter months (summer SAD does exist, though). But there’s only been limited research looking at a possible link between birth timing and mental health, according to Mokkonen.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Mokkonen and his team conducted an online survey of 303 adults. Participants provided basic demographic information like age and answered two questionnaires commonly used to assess a person’s level of anxiety and depression. After controlling for factors like age and income, the researchers found that summer-born men (specifically people whose biological sex was male) were noticeably more likely to report depression symptoms than men born anytime else. The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmen.0000296"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in the journal PLOS Mental Health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These sorts of studies can only show a correlation between any two things (seasonality at birth and depression in this case) and not decidedly prove that being born in the summer can shape men’s mental health. The researchers also admit they only collected survey responses over a brief two-month period in early 2024, meaning they might not have been able to capture people’s “variations in depression and anxiety scores.” And while some of the participants did come from different countries, a substantial proportion were college students. It’s fair to say this is far from a thorough or complete study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So clearly more research is needed to replicate and expand on this preliminary finding. There’s also the unanswered and likely complex question of why being born in the summer could be specifically worse for men but not women.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Seasonality has long played a role in affecting the survival of most species, Mokkonen noted. And while people today are generally more sheltered from the harshest elements of the outside world than our hunter-gatherer ancestors were, the changing aspects of the seasons might still be enough to subtly influence us as we’re developing in the womb.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I would say it is possibly related to the environmental conditions of the mother during pregnancy,” Mokkonen said. “Consider conditions like temperature and sunlight—how do those conditions vary across the year?”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to continue investigating how other maternal factors, including the mother’s diet and circulating hormone levels, can affect the later health of their children. Mokkonen also points out that regardless of the season they were born in, a majority of the people in their study reported having at least some symptoms of anxiety (66%) and depression (84%). In other words, while the seasons may hold some sway over us, some things are unfortunately common across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Our periodic reminder that there are many bird flus out there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/china-reports-more-h9n2-activity" target="_blank"&gt;China reports more H9N2 human cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[same link] Multidrug resistant Salmonella is spreading in poultry.  Make sure to sterilize those cutting boards!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/cambodian-boy-icu-h5n1-avian-flu-infection" target="_blank"&gt;Cambodia's thirteenth H5N1 case of this year is in ICU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/h5n1-avian-flu-hospitalizes-cambodian-man" target="_blank"&gt;And so is the fourteenth case, reported just yesterday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World health organizations say the risk to the general population is low, but it is low to moderate for those with occupational exposure [ya think?]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 16 new human cases since April noted in the risk assessment, all were previously reported, including 9 from Cambodia. Of 14 poultry outbreaks included during the period, 9 occurred in the vicinity of human cases. The other human cases were in Bangladesh, India, China, Mexico, and Vietnam. Three different H5N1 clades were involved: 2.3.2.1a from India and Bangladesh, 2.3.2.1e from Cambodia, and 2.3.4.4b from China and Mexico. &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The report didn't note the clade for Vietnam's case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside ongoing circulation in poultry and wild birds, some of the new detections in animals included H5N1 in captive serval cats in Bangladesh, domestic cats on a poultry farm in Belgium, milk from a single sheep in the United Kingdom, poultry breeder birds at a farm in Brazil, and harbor seals and sea otters in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All is not lost. A study in ferrets suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/ferret-study-suggests-seasonal-flu-immunity-may-protect-against-severe" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Seasonal flu immunity may protect against severe disease from H5N1&lt;/a&gt;.  Current seasonal flus are H1N1 and H3N2, with the former offering the most cross immunity. Flu B immunity offered no benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/africa-cdc-warns-exponential-mpox-spread-guinea" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Mpox is spreading exponentially in Guinea.&lt;/a&gt; Other countries also see worrisome rises, and vaccine supplies are dwindling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delivery of all earlier mpox vaccine deliveries has now been completed, following allocation planning, Boum said, emphasizing that the region has no more doses to distribute. Though 800,000 doses are available from mpox vaccine manufacturer Bavarian Nordic, the region and its partners, including UNICEF, have no funding to buy and deploy them, partly due to cutbacks in global health spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa CDC has estimated that 3.4 million doses are needed to meet the current demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/fda-advises-restaurants-and-retailers-not-serve-or-sell-and-consumers-not-eat-certain-frozen-raw-1" target="_blank"&gt;Norovirus contamination in oysters from Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/us-covid-levels-continue-slight-upward-trend" target="_blank"&gt;Covid detections trend slightly upward.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://polioeradication.org/about-polio/polio-this-week/" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine-derived polio cases and environmental samples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/malaria/new-findings-support-ivermectin-malaria-control" target="_blank"&gt;Ivermectin can contribute to malaria control&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a novel approach.  Apparently when people take monthly doses of ivermectin, mosquitoes that bite them die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by a recurrent or persistent sadness and a loss of interest in activities that were previously deemed pleasurable, sometimes accompanied by changes in sleep, appetite and perceived energy levels. One of the most debilitating types of depression is major depressive disorder (MDD), which entails a pervasive low mood for a prolonged time, which in turn adversely impacts people's ability to engage in daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/depression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; is estimated to be experienced by approximately 3.5% of people worldwide, understanding its neurophysiological underpinnings and its characteristic brain signatures is of utmost importance. Past studies have linked depression, particularly MDD, to structural changes in a brain region known as the medial temporal lobe, which has been implicated in the formation and retrieval of memories, as well as in emotional processing and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Aachen University and Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH recently carried out a study aimed at exploring the link between the structure of a specific part of the MTL, namely the parahippocampal cortex (PHC), and MDD. Their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-025-03435-y" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Translational Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;, suggests that the thickness of the PHC is an indicator of both MDD and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neuroticism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neuroticism&lt;/a&gt;, a psychological trait marked by a pronounced tendency to feel &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/negative+emotions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;negative emotions&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., anxiety, guilt, anger, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The PHC is a highly interconnected region within the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medial+temporal+lobe/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medial temporal lobe&lt;/a&gt; (MTL) and is essential in memory, emotion and cognition," wrote Dominik Nießen, Ravichandran Rajkumar and their colleagues in their paper. "According to the cognitive model of depression, dysfunctions in these processes constitute the pathophysiological foundation of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/major+depressive+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;major depressive disorder&lt;/a&gt; (MDD). Research suggests that human personality, and neuroticism in particular, play an important role in the development and disease progression of MDD."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, recent neuroscience studies found that the brains of people diagnosed with depression and those scoring higher on recognized tests of neuroticism often share some similarities, some of which relate to the PHC. The PHC is a part of the MTL found to support various cognitive functions, including spatial processing, as well as the encoding and retrieval of emotional memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key objective of the recent study by Nießen, Rajkumar and their colleagues was to further investigate how the overall structure of the PHC varies in individuals diagnosed with MDD or exhibiting higher levels of neuroticism. To do this, they scanned the brains of several individuals, some of whom were diagnosed with MDD, using a neuroimaging technique known as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In a matched sample of 86 adults (43 MDD patients, 43 control participants, mean age 31.4 years, range 18–61 years, 40 female), PHC thickness was measured using structural MRI at an ultra-high field strength of 7 T and compared to the level of neuroticism as measured by the NEO-FFI scale," explained Nießen, Rajkumar and their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers subsequently analyzed the brain scans collected from the study participants in conjunction with their mental health information and ratings on neuroticism tests. Overall, their findings suggest the PHC of people diagnosed with MDD and rating higher on neuroticism scales is thinner than that of individuals with low neuroticism ratings and no reported mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"MDD patients exhibited significantly lower left hemispheric PHC thickness compared to healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;fdr&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002, η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.119)," wrote the authors. "Additionally, linear regression analysis revealed a significant association between neuroticism and PHC thickness within both hemispheres (L: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;fdr&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012, β = −0.414; R: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;fdr&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008, β = −0.512), with highly neurotic individuals displaying reduced cortical thickness. These findings suggest that, in combination with neuroticism, PHC thickness could serve as a potential biomarker of depression."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent work by Nießen, Rajkumar and their colleagues identifies a new potential biomarker that could contribute to the diagnosis and understanding of persistent cases of depression. In the future, this team's findings could inspire other &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medical+researchers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical researchers&lt;/a&gt; and neuroscientists to closely examine the possible role of the PHC in depression and neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results underscore the importance of multimodal assessments in MDD, potentially contributing to the foundation of individualized clinical decision-making and paving the way towards precision psychiatry," wrote the authors.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of these tests are still in early development. The heart-age calculator is one of the first to be widely available and free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="7XLEFFMWSJGN7P52KMW3363QUE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="7XLEFFMWSJGN7P52KMW3363QUE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;New ways of assessing heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-atp-questions" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y6NOKJK3RJGM7IPXPAU4WC5L7I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Khan was the lead author of &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.067626?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank"&gt;the 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; that laid out the PREVENT equations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5TFPRU6V6NCCRKUJG3PUO6KTYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But she’s also a clinician and knew from talking to patients that “it’s really hard to understand what a 10 percent risk” of developing heart disease in the near future “means for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="76OKVBMVUFDULIIWQKSAAGBIXM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And she’s a researcher who’s &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aao1617" target="_blank"&gt;studied longevity among&lt;/a&gt; the Amish and was interested in the differences between biological and chronological age, and why people born in the same year can seem to age quite differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6EHFPIHZUVGV3LPLGTPGMH4N3U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Those interests converged when she began wondering if she could reinterpret the PREVENT equations into a framework that would be more intuitive for most people, telling them, in effect, if their hearts are aging too fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="THY42W3OYJFT7LKQNSKVQ3546Q" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="THY42W3OYJFT7LKQNSKVQ3546Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Most Americans’ hearts are older than they are&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NIY6WH7XMNAARNMLTG4VRG3PME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So, she and her colleagues used the PREVENT data to figure out benchmarks for optimal &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/01/09/heart-health-check-tests-prevention/" target="_blank"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt; markers, such as blood pressure and blood sugar, among men and women at every age from 30 to 79. These would set the underpinnings of the heart-age test. (Most of the metrics used in the calculator are standard, but some are more specialized, such as an &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/estimated-glomerular-filtration-rate-egfr" target="_blank"&gt;eGFR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/estimated-glomerular-filtration-rate-egfr" target="_blank"&gt;, &lt;/a&gt;which tests kidney function.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CGKRYN5NIBG4RHFYXQSBAF37NQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Then, since they were interested in the state of heart health in America, they checked the heart ages of more than 14,000 men and women enrolled in the government’s huge and ongoing National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-atp-questions" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C6JZ6TEOYBFLRPH7SCX5R3ZVZI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But even many people in their 30s had relatively old hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="F62HJZNXCRBT3HBPCIGJNW2ZWM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="F62HJZNXCRBT3HBPCIGJNW2ZWM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What to do about an aging heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3XMMD6OE5BHKJASNNMBS5Q3QLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What does it mean if the calculator says your heart is older than you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SOF3KIGAGVHSTEOZNQJZI2XFJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“First, it’s important to have context,” Khan said. “A year’s difference from your chronological age is probably not meaningful. But if people’s hearts are more than five years or 10 years away from their chronological age, it’s worth paying attention to what’s going on and what might be driving that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MDAXGDM435HQLE3SM5HQETFEGQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Talk to your doctor if your heart age is at least five years older than your calendar age, she said. The calculator might be indicating you’d benefit from more vigilance. “We know that half of people with &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/06/17/blood-pressure-diet-salt-alcohol/" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; aren’t being treated,” she said, “and most people who qualify for &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/22/statins-cholesterol-aging/" target="_blank"&gt;statin therapy&lt;/a&gt; aren’t on it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OTRKDVZVSNGG7LDFCEFBQT3AIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The interventions needn’t all be medical. “Lifestyle changes, especially &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/27/walking-cadence-aging-health-improvement/" target="_blank"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; and diet, are also important,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XPPZDTTKYBBY7AYVZD22NDDGAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Even people whose heart ages equal or prove younger than their actual age can benefit from that knowledge, she said. “One of the most challenging things is to maintain &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/21/longevity-exercise-resistance-training/" target="_blank"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;.” So, as the years pass or you enter health transitions, such as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/05/02/menopause-brain-changes/" target="_blank"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;, the calculator might be able to help you track how well your heart continues to age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="C3UUINT72FFDTN66WJRQGAYRI4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="C3UUINT72FFDTN66WJRQGAYRI4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What the calculator leaves out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FLTWLKXLXRGU3CH3G4UHACU63E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The heart-age calculator has limits, though. “It’s a way to communicate risk that will resonate with some people,” said Martha Gulati, the director of preventive cardiology and associate director of the Barbra Streisand Women’s Heart Center at Cedars-Sinai Health Sciences University in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D7ERNWZ6VJC7FKLWKNLBJCOYKE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But its equations don’t include certain cardiovascular risk factors specific to women, she said, such as menopausal changes and pregnancy complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C4NXJQ3ZUNGZXALMTSBODH4XIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;They also don’t include estimations of aerobic fitness or exercise habits, which can be key to heart health, said Ulrik Wisloff, the head of the cardiac exercise research group at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, Norway, who’s studied exercise and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/18/sitting-rising-test-longevity/" target="_blank"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; for decades. “I still find it puzzling why physical activity and peak oxygen uptake have yet to be incorporated into the original Framingham risk model, despite strong evidence” for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27881567/" target="_blank"&gt;their predictive power&lt;/a&gt;, he said. His group has developed its own free, online &lt;a href="https://fitnessage.miahealth.no/en" target="_blank"&gt;calculator&lt;/a&gt;, based on exercise and endurance, that estimates your fitness age in comparison with your chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3NEELNEIZNGS7IYOOM5OTWBO4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The key point about all of these biological-age calculators, whether they focus on fitness or organs, such as hearts, is that they can serve as a wake-up call, Gulati said.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is treated with antibiotics including azithromycin, fluoroquinolones (like levofloxacin or moxifloxacin), and sometimes doxycycline or rifampin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-b39120e0-6d41-11f0-a915-e3a1fd4ab79e" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; reports that cases of Legionnaires' disease have been increasing since the early 2000s and hit a peak in 2018 with 9,933 confirmed cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to reporting discrepancies and various databases, data on the number of legionnaires' cases and deaths is fragmented and varies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, according to the CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDS), from 2000 through 2019, a total of 82,352 confirmed Legionnaires’ disease cases were reported from 52 US jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 10 people who become sick will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The odds of death are higher when the disease is contracted in a hospital setting, with at least one in four dying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most reliable way to determine if your water is contaminated with Legionella is to have it tested by a qualified laboratory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Home testing kits are also available, which involve collecting water samples and sending them to a lab for analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, one person died and several were hospitalized due to an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at a senior living facility in Vermont. It originated from the care home's water system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In general, the CDC reports that cases of Legionnaires' disease have been increasing since the early 2000s, with a peak in 2018 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Legionella can colonize and grow within complex communities of microorganisms called biofilms that form on surfaces within water systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once there, the bacteria seeps into the water and becomes aerosolized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plumbing systems, especially those associated with warm water, such as hot water tanks and distribution pipes, can also serve as reservoirs for Legionella bacteria to multiply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From there it can contaminate water in pipes. Stagnant or low-flow areas in pipes also foster Legionella growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-7b200640-6d46-11f0-a65b-29defdbea910" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14954791/Legionnaires-disease-death-Michigan-cases.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;WHAT IS LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia that causes lung inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is caused by a bacterium, known as Legionella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 500 people in the UK and 6,100 in the US suffer every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition can cause life-threatening complications, including respiratory failure, kidney failure and septic shock, which occurs when blood flow to the vital organs is blocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most sufferers become ill by inhaling tiny water droplets from infected sources, such as shower heads, hot tubs, swimming pools or ventilation systems in buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anyone can become infected, however, at-risk people include the elderly, smokers and those with suppressed immune systems, such as chemotherapy patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms usually develop between two and 10 days after exposure to the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle Pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Fever and chills &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People may then experience:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough, which may bring up blood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breathlessness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Confusion &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment is antibiotics, usually in hospital, as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prevention involves meticulous cleaning and disinfection of water systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People can reduce their risk by not smoking as this damages the lungs and makes individuals more susceptible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Source: Mayo Clinic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 16:17:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPZE1jeVFNc3QtdDZpSmIxMmJfUXJZVVlScndEYnB6V0NHR0gxRU9kMl9MWGF4WWF2dUpFZ3FVcUtWaUtna1B0UHhCWXJmTnFCV2o0d2ZpbEQyQ2x1QUhEd3lubjBxclUwUklsMzhULVBVNXRsUWFCVWhpSDZJb3k5T0tYUFFmQjZva1BwWGs1T2k0aGdTcmRfazdBRjBoY2PSAaQBQVVfeXFMTm1PRjJyU1dHVnFSUnE1QXBkRE1QbEtZQVNxbHBhd3ZkeVJpYjZia1psNkpCRzl2NzQwSUJ4OFNoV3B5WTVpckYySDRHVGJWUTVpSi1DUUJYTjlwZFdTbmE4czJyaGwyc1hCYXkycUlpSGdpcHczNkhfZ0J3NjVJNVpLb3A4UF8yUGJxRjdxNjZvZEdQS3NSbFhUVHdwcUhGZ0V0ZUk</guid></item><item><title>为什么随着年龄的增长保护您的听力非常重要–以及专家的建议- theguardian.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQV0lJVHk2VVc1YUY1eF9qSndQZEhHRUVBSFJabENjUnoxT1BMWC1POHlTa2lqamlyRnhWN096dHB4OW1kWk5LOHppdGVOQ2FXMndMQjhfNEt5a29tVTVRak1xNW5LQ285clQtVTl5X3NJaV9oRGdVX0ROZDlKbUxIRjlnYlhTNnFEMGI0Z0pkb05sYjVreW93aDFaUzFNUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2832869" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; examined the potential link between hearing loss and dementia, suggesting that treating hearing loss can help the brain. Although the possible connection is still being untangled, study co-author and audiologist &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/nicholas-s-reed" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nicholas Reed&lt;/a&gt; advises prioritizing hearing health regardless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There are already more than enough established benefits related to hearing care,” says Reed, a faculty member of the NYU Langone &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Optimal Aging Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"wellness","tags":[{"id":"wellness/series/the-joys-of-aging","type":"Series","title":"The joys of ageing"},{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"science/ageing","type":"Keyword","title":"Ageing"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/sarah-sloat","type":"Contributor","title":"Sarah Sloat"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle-and-wellness","type":"Tracking","title":"US lifestyle and wellness"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"wellness/2025/jul/30/hearing-loss-clarity-cognitive-decline-isolation","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;What’s especially important about supporting hearing health is the effect it has on keeping people engaged in the world, Reed explains. Here’s what experts recommend in order to support your hearing as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-hearing-loss-occur" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How does hearing loss occur?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hearing loss can result from a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deafness-and-hearing-loss" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;wide range&lt;/a&gt; of genetic and environmental factors, such as chronic diseases and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7541613/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt;. Some also experience age-related hearing loss, called &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/age-related-hearing-loss" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;presbycusis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hearing loss is “not about volume”, Reed explains. Instead, it’s a clarity issue. We lose our hearing at different frequencies at different rates, which can make sounds garbled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4dea5699-6992-4b84-88a5-d2ad1826eaab" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I thought I was a bad listener.

Other conditions can seem more pressing, and hearing loss becomes a low priority. There can be “downstream effects” in a healthcare context because hearing loss can hinder patient-provider communication, says Reed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-relationship-between-hearing-loss-and-dementia" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is the relationship between hearing loss and dementia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Early research suggests that hearing loss is associated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3869227/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increased cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21320988/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;an increased risk of new cases of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, although further studies are needed to understand this connection. Researchers have not, however, found a cause-and-effect relationship between hearing loss and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Reed and his colleagues wanted to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2832869" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;calculate the number of cases of dementia&lt;/a&gt; there could be in a population if a potential risk factor, in this case hearing loss, was eliminated. They used a sample of nearly 3,000 adults aged 66 to 90 and found 32% of the dementia risk in the sample group was potentially associated with audiometric hearing loss (hearing loss measured through testing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to the authors, these results suggest that treating hearing loss may delay the onset of dementia in some older adults. However, this research cannot establish whether hearing loss causes dementia, explains co-author Jason Smith, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One potential reason hearing loss is associated with cognitive changes is that it can lead to more social isolation, which may strain the brain and affect memory, says Reed. Another theory is that because auditory signals stimulate the brain, the lack of stimulation caused by hearing loss can lead to accelerated &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9649369/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;brain atrophy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"05596153-ddcc-440b-b05d-469b83a67176","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="05596153-ddcc-440b-b05d-469b83a67176" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If hearing problems are linked to an increased risk of dementia, are there ways to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/54/1/afaf004/7965371?login=false" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reduce that risk?&lt;/a&gt; An influential 2020 Lancet &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; recommended the use of hearing aids and protecting ears from excessive noise exposure.

We can also limit exposure to sources of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240020481" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;damaging noise&lt;/a&gt;, like construction equipment, lawn mowers, motorcycles and loud music. Small actions, like protecting your hearing at a loud concert with over-ear headphones, which Reed prefers to earplugs, can have a big impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-18" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Establishing a baseline can help you identify changes over time, and indicate if and when new habits might be useful. The longer you live with impaired hearing, the harder it is to adjust to tools like hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-it-possible-to-reverse-hearing-loss" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Is it possible to reverse hearing loss?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Several treatments and devices can help alleviate hearing loss, but their effectiveness depends on the individual. If you suspect you have hearing issues, it’s best to have your hearing checked and discuss options with your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hearing aids can be purchased &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/hearing-aids-and-personal-sound-amplification-products-what-know" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;over-the-counter&lt;/a&gt; or with a prescription. Reed says learning how to wear them takes &lt;a href="https://www.ncoa.org/article/how-to-adjust-to-hearing-aids/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;time and practice&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a critical public health need to &lt;a href="https://mostpolicyinitiative.org/science-note/hearing-aids-and-medicaid/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;expand coverage&lt;/a&gt; for these tools, says Smith, because it’s well-established that hearing aids can improve quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While studies haven’t proven that hearing aids will delay dementia, scientists are intrigued by their potential to support brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The idea is that, in theory, if a person uses hearing aids, communication becomes easier and you lower the burden of cognitive load,” says Reed. “You’re stimulating the brain with more auditory signals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Staying engaged in social networks is key to maintaining mental and physical wellbeing, says Reed. In a 2025 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2833601" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Reed and colleagues found that, among people with hearing loss, participants who received hearing aids and were counseled on their use experienced less loneliness and social isolation. They also had more varied types of connections, such as friends, family and acquaintances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Similarly, assistive &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/assistive-devices-people-hearing-voice-speech-or-language-disorders" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;technologies&lt;/a&gt; may help. These range widely in function and design, but generally amplify sound, reduce background noise, and improve communication. For example, &lt;a href="https://mn.gov/deaf-hard-of-hearing/assistive-technology/apps/#:~:text=Some%20examples%20of%20speech%2Dto%2Dtext%20apps:%20*%20Ava,(iOS%2C%20Android%2C%20Windows)%20*%20Otter.ai%20(iOS%2C%20Android)" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt; that convert speech to text can assist with phone calls, and personal amplifiers can enhance hearing in conversations. People with mild to moderate hearing loss may find some relief in settings like crowded restaurants through items like the Apple AirPods Pro 2, which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/26/apple-airpods-pro-2-hearing-aids-use-australia-tga" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;feature a built-in hearing aid&lt;/a&gt;, says Reed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In some instances, what can help a person manage hearing loss best is how they are supported by their community. There’s a need for more equitable environments that support people with sensory health needs, says Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Some communication tips can go really far,” says Reed. “Good communication is looking someone in the face. It’s speaking slowly. It’s about rephrasing and adding context.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>theguardian.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQV0lJVHk2VVc1YUY1eF9qSndQZEhHRUVBSFJabENjUnoxT1BMWC1POHlTa2lqamlyRnhWN096dHB4OW1kWk5LOHppdGVOQ2FXMndMQjhfNEt5a29tVTVRak1xNW5LQ285clQtVTl5X3NJaV9oRGdVX0ROZDlKbUxIRjlnYlhTNnFEMGI0Z0pkb05sYjVreW93aDFaUzFNUQ</guid></item><item><title>您对防晒霜了解多少？参加我们的测验。-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE5oMWJZb3VLcV8tY1NNSmZZN0xqZHA2djBxR2xsUkZZcGRNNTFVSjhVZGZrcS1qbG5nSENlUXczcmlrWWpqMTU2T25VMDV5cy11U25fOWZ0Ul9xMzctNHJyOWpNOWxrSnlfSGw4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 15:16:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE5oMWJZb3VLcV8tY1NNSmZZN0xqZHA2djBxR2xsUkZZcGRNNTFVSjhVZGZrcS1qbG5nSENlUXczcmlrWWpqMTU2T25VMDV5cy11U25fOWZ0Ul9xMzctNHJyOWpNOWxrSnlfSGw4</guid></item><item><title>新工具显示，大多数美国人的心脏比实际年龄更老- statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOQm9jQnBCSXE1MVp4T2Jvb3NaeWhMYjhla0lfOHlselBtZEg1enIxcm5Ec2M4VW9VUE9fZHNnbHpWMERfWUdWdU1fMkx3OU52YTlSV3J1SldNVDJCRHVWZWhOcjg1T29QY083ZVFpUm0xQTVMMFhJWW42dEdkTHc1Qjh0QWMzZWxSU2NPQVYxOEY0ak5BSHhPOU8xc1V4bnM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biological aging is hot. Even if &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/02/what-is-biological-age-researchers-in-aging-epigenetic-clocks/"&gt;scientists don’t agree on its definition&lt;/a&gt;, estimating how old your body is despite what the calendar says has gained steam in recent years. Measuring telomeres or genetic variables may be more appealing than, say, predicting your chances of having a heart attack as a percentage over 10 years, but under either method, age can move in two directions, adding years with &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/05/black-americans-weathering-environment/"&gt;exposure to unhealthy environments&lt;/a&gt; or subtracting them with both good luck and behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By a new tool that assesses heart health using standard measures like blood pressure and cholesterol, most Americans are not aging well. Whether sharing that information as “heart age” will help them remains an open question. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists took advantage of the current zeitgeist in a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamacardio.2025.2427?guestAccessKey=b495ff9e-d579-42a1-9250-e59b5e6197e3&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=073025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JAMA Cardiology research letter&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in which they proposed a &lt;a href="https://nwkhanlab.shinyapps.io/riskage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;heart age calculator&lt;/a&gt; doctors can use to compute a patient’s cardiac future in a typical primary care visit. Age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, eGFR (a measure of kidney health), diabetes, smoking, and taking statins and high blood pressure medications are fed into a formula based on the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/29/cardiovascular-risk-model-statins-heart-attacks/'"&gt;PREVENT&lt;/a&gt; model, a set of equations released last year to inform treatment guidelines. An older risk calculator, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.699579" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;out in 2008&lt;/a&gt;, was based on the well-established Framingham Heart Study. PREVENT uses more contemporary data reflecting a wider population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think this is an interesting approach that will hopefully prove to be a good way to communicate about risk of cardiovascular disease that patients find meaningful and understandable,” Jeremy Sussman, a primary care physician at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, told STAT.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Sussman, also a health services researcher at the University of Michigan, was not involved in the JAMA Cardiology paper.  “We’ve developed many ways to communicate cardiovascular risk in the past and sometimes patients don’t find those as clear as we would like to hope.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the new risk calculator was applied to 14,000 Americans in a long-running national health survey who were 30 to 79 years old, it said more than half of adults have hearts older than their chronological age, with wider gaps on average for some groups. For example:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Women had a heart age of 55.4 compared to a chronological age of 51.3. For men, the average heart age was 56.7 compared to a chronological age of 49.7. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Having a high school education or less added 10 years to heart age.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Black men’s heart age was 8.5 years older than their actual age; the gap was 7.9 years for Hispanic men, 6.7 years for Asian men, and 6.4 years for white men.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Black women’s hearts were  6.2 years older, Hispanic women’s were 4.8 years older, white women’s 3.7 years older,  and Asian women’s were 2.8 years older.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-stat-article-recirc-curated"&gt;		&lt;aside class="recirc-curated-content"&gt;
			&lt;span class="recirc-curated-bg-text"&gt;Heart health&lt;/span&gt;
			&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;More on heart health&lt;/h2&gt;
			
		&lt;/aside&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Things like heart age can be a little bit more motivation for diet and exercise changes, potentially smoking cessation, in addition to adherence to medication if it’s indicated,” co-author and preventive cardiologist Sadiya Khan told STAT. She is a professor of cardiovascular epidemiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “We’re hoping that this allows a different way to communicate that resonates or allows people to connect with this idea of aging that I think is a little easier to understand than risk for having an event.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Khan said more research is needed on what the optimal strategy for risk communication might be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Ultimately, whether it’s your heart age or it’s your risk score, all of these are meant to help primary care clinicians and preventive clinicians improve cardiovascular health and prevent cardiovascular disease,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a companion &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamacardio.2025.2404?guestAccessKey=89b47187-85c1-42da-bfc9-031b4bb0500e&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=073025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt;, physicians Mohammad Al Mouslmani, Abdulla Damluji, and Michael Nanna warned that knowledge could cut two ways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While a higher biological age may motivate some individuals to adopt healthier behaviors, others may find such information demoralizing or overwhelming, especially those with fewer resources or competing life demands,” they wrote. “Public health messaging and clinician communication should be sensitive to these dynamics, ensuring that risk age is framed not as a verdict, but as an opportunity for change, supported by accessible interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Then, in a process Kukushkin described as a tedious choreography of clockwork pipetting, they exposed the cells to precisely timed bursts of chemicals that imitated bursts of neurotransmitters in the brain. Kukushkin’s team found that the both the nerve and kidney cells could finely differentiate these patterns. A steady three-minute burst activated CRE, making the cells glow for a few hours. But the same amount of chemicals, delivered as four shorter pulses spaced 10 minutes apart, lit up the petri dish for over a day, indicating a lasting imprint — a memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kukushkin’s findings suggest that nonneural cells can count and detect patterns. Even though they can’t do it at the speed of a neuron, they do remember, and they appear to remember a stimulus for longer when it is delivered at spaced intervals — a hallmark of memory formation in all animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, this makes sense, Gershman said. From the perspective of the cell, or any other living system that shows the spacing effect, spaced information is evidence of a fairly consistent, slow-moving environment: a steady world. Massed information, on the other hand — a singular burst of chemicals or an all-night cram session — might represent a fluky event in a more chaotic environment. “If the world is changing really fast, you should forget things [more easily], because the things that you learned are going to have a shorter shelf life,” Gershman said. “They’re not going to be as useful later on, because the world will have changed.” These dynamics are as relevant to a cell’s existence as they are to ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="post__aside mb2 relative mha post__aside--right hide-on-print"&gt;&lt;div class="post__aside__pullquote relative"&gt;

        &lt;div class="mb1"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A vaccination is a kind of memory. So is a scar, a child, a book.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kukushkin, who has recently taken to calling himself a “molecular philosopher,” is fairly certain his findings would have been the same regardless of the type of cell he used. “I’m accepting bets for anybody’s favorite cell line showing a spacing effect,” he said. “I think it should be the default assumption that memory is a continuous process — that all these single cells memorize, that plants memorize, that neurons and all kinds of cell types memorize in the same way. The burden of proof shouldn’t be in proving that it’s the same. The burden of proof should be in proving that it’s different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gershman agrees. “In a brain, the dynamics [of memory] concern neurons signaling to each other: a multicellular phenomenon,” he said. “But in a single cell, maybe we’re talking about the dynamics within a cell of molecules at different timescales. Different physical mechanisms can give rise to a common cognitive process, similar to how I could use a pen or a pencil or typewriter or computer to write a letter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the letter — that is, the memory — is what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural Bias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason that science has been hesitant to embrace cellular-scale memory is sociological, Gunawardena said. The findings of early researchers such as Jennings and Gelber were memory-holed because they didn’t resonate with the prevailing theories of their time: Jennings’ discovery of memory in &lt;em&gt;Stentor &lt;/em&gt;went against the dogma of “tropisms,” which inspired the behaviorist psychology dominant in Gelber’s day. Both of these views presumed a living world populated by biological automata, cycling through preprogrammed responses. Cells that can learn and adapt didn’t figure into such models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We all have our ideologies,” said Gunawardena, who is now at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. “It’s just a natural part of how humans deal with the world. … In science, we’ve really underplayed how important those biases can be in organizing scientific communities, and in setting what is considered appropriate and not appropriate science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="post__aside mb2 relative post__aside--right"&gt;&lt;figure class="mb2 mt1 image--shortcode s:mt-0"&gt;
    
            &lt;figcaption class="image__meta mt1"&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;“I think it should be the default assumption that memory is a continuous process,” said Nikolay Kukushkin, a neuroscientist at New York University — that “all kinds of cell types memorize in the same way.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also an issue of semantics. Like all important terminology, “memory” is loaded, imprecise and defined variously by different disciplines. It means one thing to a computer scientist and another to a biologist — to say nothing of the rest of us. “When you ask a normal person what memory is, they think of it introspectively,” Kukushkin said. “They think, ‘Well, I close my eyes and I think back to yesterday, and that’s memory.’ But that’s not what we’re studying in science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In neuroscience, Kukushkin writes, the most common definition of memory is that it’s what remains after experience to change future behavior. This is a behavioral definition; the only way to measure it is to observe that future behavior. Think of &lt;em&gt;S. roeselii&lt;/em&gt; snapping back into its holdfast, or a lab rat freezing up at the sight of an electrified maze it’s tangled with before. In these cases, how an organism reacts is a clue that prior experience left a lingering trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is a memory only a memory when it’s associated with an external behavior? “It seems like an arbitrary thing to decide,” Kukushkin said. “I understand why it was historically decided to be that, because [behavior] is the thing you can measure easily when you’re working with an animal. I think what happened is that behavior started as something that you could measure, and then it ended up being the definition of memory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavior tells us that a memory has formed but says nothing about why, how or where. Further, it’s constrained by scale. Take &lt;em&gt;Aplysia californica&lt;/em&gt;, a muscular sea slug with enormous neurons (the largest is about the size of a letter on a U.S. penny). Neuroscientists love to conduct memory experiments on &lt;em&gt;Aplysia&lt;/em&gt; because its physical responses are easy to measure — poke it and it flinches — and they map cleanly to the handful of sensory and motor neurons involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sea slug, Kukushkin said, can complicate neuroscience’s behavioral bias. Say you shock its tail, triggering a defensive reflex. If you shock it again the next day and find that the defensive reflex is stronger than it was before, that’s behavioral evidence that the slug remembers its initial shock. Any neuroscientist would associate it with a memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A universal cancer vaccine in development could help rev up the immune system against tumors and supercharge the effects of existing cancer therapies, an animal study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to vaccines for viral infections like the flu, many &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/what-are-cancer-vaccines" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/what-are-cancer-vaccines"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cancer vaccines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are designed to help the immune system recognize specific proteins. However, while conventional vaccines aim to prevent disease, cancer vaccines are currently being developed to clear away cancers already growing in the body and to help prevent treated cancers from coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, conventional vaccines and cancer vaccines often work similarly. The flu shot trains the immune system to look for unique proteins found on the surface of influenza viruses, while cancer vaccines typically teach immune cells to spot unique features of cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's a challenge: These cancer proteins of interest can often be &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_4194257219349349576&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41392-022-01270-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fcancer%2Funiversal-cancer-vaccine-heading-to-human-trials-could-be-useful-for-all-forms-of-cancer" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-022-01270-x" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41392-022-01270-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fcancer%2Funiversal-cancer-vaccine-heading-to-human-trials-could-be-useful-for-all-forms-of-cancer" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;unique to individual patients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, meaning each cancer vaccine may need to be specially formulated for each patient.

In the COVID-19 vaccines, the molecule contains instructions for a bit of the coronavirus; in the new cancer vaccine, it carries instructions for a substance that raises the body's first-line immune defenses, poking the "innate" immune system rather than the "adaptive.".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the vaccine aims to boost the body's production of type-I interferons — immune messengers that play important roles in controlling inflammation and spotting cancerous tumors in order to eliminate them. In a series of experiments in lab mice, the researchers demonstrated that this signaling is key to snuffing out tumors early in their development. The signals help rally the immune system to attack the tumors and hinder the cancer's growth, and if you block them, tumor growth goes haywire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these experiments showed that this early interferon activity is vital to a common form of cancer treatment, called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/checkpoint-inhibitors" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/checkpoint-inhibitors" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;immune checkpoint inhibitors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These treatments rip the breaks off of immune cells so they maintain a high level of activity and kill off cancer efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer has ways of hijacking interferon signals and thus thwarting the anti-cancer immune response that follows — so the cancer vaccine acts as a kind of immune "reset," Sayour explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the vaccine in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor in a mouse model of melanoma, a type of skin cancer. In mice with treatment-resistant tumors, the combo of treatments worked better than checkpoint inhibitors alone, the team found. They also tested the vaccine on its own in mouse models of other cancers, including glioma (a brain cancer) and pulmonary osteosarcoma (bone cancer that's spread to the lungs). It showed promising anti-cancer effects when applied by itself, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this early work, the team tested a few different mRNA formulations to stir up the interferon response and found that each did so effectively. More work is needed to understand if the mRNA molecules themselves or the proteins they're used to make are more important for triggering this generalized response, Sayour noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study focused on solid tumors, which tend to be more resistant to immunotherapy than blood cancers are, Sayour said. But "I personally think this can be used for all forms of cancer," he added. "I believe this is a universal paradigm that can be used to treat cancer." In particular, he could see it being applied as secondary prevention, to help stop treated cancers from coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This exciting and novel paper shows promising evidence that giving the immune system a short, targeted boost at just the right time can help previously unresponsive tumors respond to immunotherapy," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://stempel.fiu.edu/faculty-staff/profiles/azzam-diana.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://stempel.fiu.edu/faculty-staff/profiles/azzam-diana.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Diana Azzam&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor and scientific director at the Center for Advancing Personalized Cancer Treatments at Florida International University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This approach could be especially helpful for 'cold' tumors — types of cancer that usually don't trigger a strong immune response, like pancreatic, ovarian, and some types of breast cancer," Azzam, who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. These tumors hide from the immune system and can be difficult to target with immunotherapy, so it's possible that this type of vaccine could help expose these cancers to attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While more research is needed to confirm how well this approach will work in people, the encouraging results in mice offer a strong foundation," Azzam said. In people, you'd want to ensure that the vaccine mounts a helpful immune response without sparking unwanted inflammation in the long run, for instance. "Future studies will address key questions around safety, consistency, and long-term effectiveness in real-world cancer patients," she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Sayour and his colleagues have &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05660408" target="_blank" data-url="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05660408" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;launched a human trial testing a two-hit approach&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: an off-the-shelf cancer vaccine followed by a personalized one. They're working with patients with two types of recurrent cancers: either pediatric high-grade glioma or osteosarcoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This approach saves valuable time needed for personalized vaccinations and may induce rapid immunity that can be further seized upon by personalized therapy," Sayour said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-jtZ6oYVDZuA2TpJPmCr7DC-t0oHUELy1hHlkzQWE9iHpLfgzlgCbueR" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-jtZ6oYVDZuA2TpJPmCr7DC-t0oHUELy1hHlkzQWE9iHpLfgzlgCbueR slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But the nutritional community has largely started to change its tune on these great little sources of protein, stating that the cholesterol concerns might have been a tad overblown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="3" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Now, new research published in &lt;em data-node-id="3.1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916525002539?via%3Dihub" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916525002539?via%3Dihub" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition" data-node-id="3.1.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is providing scientific evidence that supports the idea that you don’t need to stress about eggs' cholesterol content. Instead, you should be concerned about the saturated fat that’s often present in high quantities in foods that usually go with eggs, according to the findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s important to point out that the study was funded by the Egg Nutrition Center, which is a division of the American Egg Board.

One group had diet that was &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65076323/beans-cholesterol-inflammation-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65076323/beans-cholesterol-inflammation-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="high in cholesterol" data-node-id="9.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;high in cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, low in saturated fat, and involved eating two eggs a day. Another had people eat an egg-free diet that was low in cholesterol and high in saturated fat. The final group followed a diet that was high in cholesterol, high in saturated fat, and involved eating one egg per week. (This was the control group.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The researchers discovered that people who ate two eggs a day lowered their LDL (“bad”) cholesterol compared to the control group. The egg-free group didn’t have the same results. The researchers also found that it seems to be the saturated fats that are found in foods like bacon and sausage that are usually eaten with eggs that actually raise LDL cholesterol levels—not the eggs themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Saturated fat, not dietary cholesterol, elevates LDL cholesterol,” the researchers wrote. “Compared with consuming a high-saturated fat diet with only one egg a week, consuming two eggs daily as part of a low-saturated fat diet lowers LDL concentrations, which may reduce cardiovascular disease risk.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“This study’s core claim does track with what we’ve been seeing over the past decade: Saturated fat has a stronger impact on LDL cholesterol than dietary cholesterol,” says &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://keatleymnt.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Scott Keatley" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Scott Keatley&lt;/a&gt;, RD, co-owner of Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy. “This is backed by multiple meta-analyses and guidelines have been shifting away from blaming eggs alone and more toward the dietary context in which eggs are eaten.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-is-cholesterol-content-not-actually-something-to-worry-about" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;Why is cholesterol content not actually something to worry about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While people love to hate on cholesterol, it actually has a role in the body. “Cholesterol is an essential nutrient that has many roles, including functioning as a precursor to hormones and contributing to the integrity of cellular membranes,” says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/sonya.angelone/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sonya Angelone," data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Sonya Angelone,&lt;/a&gt; RDN, a nutritionist and registered dietitian based in San Francisco, California. “This is why your liver produces cholesterol.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Eggs are the primary source of dietary cholesterol, but when you consume more and more cholesterol in your diet, your liver produces less to compensate for the higher amount you're consuming, Angelone explains. “If you eat less cholesterol, your liver tends to produce more cholesterol,” she says. “Research has not provided strong evidence that dietary cholesterol, especially from eggs, increases blood levels of cholesterol or increases risk for heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Consuming dietary cholesterol from eggs as part of a low saturated fat diet does not seem to raise LDL cholesterol levels, according to the study findings. “The risk for heart disease comes mainly from the other foods on the breakfast plate, like sausage or bacon,” Angelone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Keatley points this out, too: “When we’re talking about fat and cholesterol, we’re only talking about the yolk. Egg whites can and should be on the menu now.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-should-you-focus-on-lowering-the-amount-of-saturated-fats-youre-consuming" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;Why should you focus on lowering the amount of saturated fats you're consuming?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Scientific data increasing show that saturated fat can be an issue when it comes to your LDL cholesterol levels. “Current research suggests that saturated fat is the primary component in one’s diet that raises 'bad' LDL cholesterol,” says &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/matthew-black" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/matthew-black" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Matthew Black" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Matthew Black&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, LD, a dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “Additional research also indicates that diets too high in saturated fats can contribute towards developing cellular inflammation and insulin resistance, which is a metabolic condition in which your body’s cells do not respond to insulin as efficiently as they should, leading to possible health problems including type 2 diabetes and difficulty losing or maintaining a healthy weight.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Saturated fats also tend to be found in highly processed foods, which are also known to raise LDL cholesterol, Angelone says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-are-eggs-so-healthy-for-your-diet" data-node-id="23" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.0"&gt;Why are eggs so healthy for your diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Eggs pack a pretty good health punch, and are great for a variety of reasons. “Containing about 6.5 grams of protein each, eggs are not only considered a complete protein, containing all nine essential amino acids, but they are also regarded as having high bioavailability [the extent to which the nutrients in food are absorbed and utilized by the body], due to their ease of digestibility and absorption,” Black says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Whole eggs, i.e. the yolk and egg white, also contain include essential vitamins and minerals like vitamins A,D,E, and K, B12, iron, and selenium, Black adds. And according to Angelone, the yolks are a good source of iron, containing carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, which promote eye health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;That's not all! Eggs are also a rich source of choline, a nutrient that supports brain health and isn’t found in large amounts in other foods, Angelone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Dietitians just recommend being mindful of what you’re serving up alongside those eggs. “Overall, if you’re healthy and eating eggs as part of a diet that’s otherwise low in saturated fat, you’re probably just fine,” Keatley says. “But if those eggs are served with buttered toast, bacon, and sausage, then the eggs alone aren’t the issue, but they’re not a health halo either. Context is everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

&lt;p&gt;The leading U.S. authority on the science of ultra-processed foods made headlines this spring when he accused the Trump administration of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/well/kevin-hall-nutrition-retirement-nih-censorship-rfk-maha.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;censoring his work&lt;/a&gt; and opted to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/16/nih-kevin-hall-ultraprocessed-foods-nutrition-censorship/"&gt;retire from his position&lt;/a&gt; at the National Institutes of Health. Without interference from D.C. to worry about, and with a forthcoming book, “Food Intelligence,” to promote, Hall is ready to speak candidly about his experiences with the leaders of the Make America Healthy Again movement. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That includes going into detail about why the plan for Hall’s return to NIH — &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/16/nih-kevin-hall-ultraprocessed-foods-nutrition-censorship/"&gt;touted&lt;/a&gt; by the agency’s director Jay Bhattacharya — fell apart, and what Hall sees as top health officials’ ongoing failure to pursue scientific answers about exactly how ultra-processed foods are hurting Americans’ health.&lt;/p&gt;

	In an image-obsessed industry, maintaining a robust head of hair isn’t just about vanity — it also signals success and staying power. Check out any over-50 star still working — nearly all have full, Samson-like manes to match their career stamina. And an unknowable number have gone to great lengths, and great expense, to preserve it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	A possible miracle drug — think GLP-1 for hair — might be cropping up. Earlier this year, scientists at UCLA discovered a new molecule, PP405, that reportedly awakens dormant follicles after applying it to the scalp at bedtime for a week. Approval for mainstream use, however, might take a few years.

	&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	In the meantime, early detection of shedding is crucial. “If you catch hair loss in earlier stages, patients do much better and require less intervention,” says Robert Finney, a board-certified cosmetic dermatologist and hair-loss expert. “If you wait, the same result isn’t always possible and you may have to do and spend more.” He recommends seeing a dermatologist for proper diagnosis. “Although there are many causes of hair loss, the most common type we encounter is genetic: androgenetic alopecia (AGA), and it’s progressive. If not addressed, eventually those hairs will be gone forever.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Patience also is key. “Treating hair loss should be viewed as a marathon, not a sprint,” adds Finney. “Men who are suffering from AGA require prescription medications as early as possible. For women, three signs that it’s actually genetic are: ponytail thickness has slowly declined over the years, the part has subtly widened, or the hairs at the front become wispier and break easier.”

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	When treating mild hair loss in men and women, Finney is a proponent of the FDA-approved classics: finasteride (via prescription and may reportedly affect libido) and minoxidil, available OTC for less than $15: “Whether orally or topically, they can often be all you need.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	For later stages, incorporating regenerative in-office treatments can make a noticeable difference. Says Alexander GolBerg, a double board-certified physician specializing in functional and aesthetic medicine: “I’m seeing incredible results with a combination of Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), low-level laser therapy (LLLT) and exosomes, paired with targeted IV therapy to nourish the body from within.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Exoceuticals&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is one of the newer, patented exosome-based skincare lines that has introduced their haircare collection, , which has “been shown to stimulate dermal papillae cells, follicle stem cells as well as the follicle itself,” says Dr. Robin Smith, co-founder and regenerative medicine pioneer. “In our clinical evaluations in men and women across all ages, we are seeing extraordinary growth and reduction in shedding, independent of the cause.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Finney also recommends ultrasound and laser treatments, such as TED/Transepidermal Delivery and Keralase, respectively ($600 to $1,500), with the bonus that they’re injection-free. He also offers ScalpStim Pro, his blend of dutasteride and growth factors used with microneedling and ultrasound to deliver ingredients directly to the follicles.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;span class="a-font-secondary-s lrv-u-margin-r-025"&gt;This follicular-challenged male, a patient of Dr. Robert Finney, was already on topical or oral finasteride and minoxidil and had stalled — then he turned to Finney’s ScalpStim Pro treatments.&lt;/span&gt;
		
									&lt;cite class="a-font-accent-uppercase-xs lrv-u-color-grey-dark"&gt;Courtesy (2)&lt;/cite&gt;
					
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;

			
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Several at-home options also are worth trying. Finney is a fan of Plated and Kerafactor serums used in combination with the Current Body LED Hair Growth Helmet and Laduora low-level laser therapy devices. But as the $8 billion hair restoration industry continues to explode, buyers should beware. “Many OTC products rely on buzzwords like ‘biotin,’ ‘caffeine’ or ‘obscure herbs.’ While not harmful, they’re rarely effective on their own,” GolBerg says. “If it sounds too good to be true, like ‘overnight regrowth’ or ‘miracle oils,’ it probably is.”

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Even in cases of advanced thinning or visible balding, there’s still a path forward. “While transplants remain an option, many of my patients now prefer a less invasive approach. We can improve density without surgery. I’ve seen some truly transformational results over time,” adds GolBerg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	As for transplants, which can cost upward of $40,000, Finney poses a warning: “It should always look natural, and if it doesn’t, you picked a bad surgeon or flew to Turkey [where fees are much lower]. A Turkish hairline is visible a mile away because they create perfectly straight hairlines, and it’s an unnatural look. A good surgeon will stagger it and use follicular units with a varying number of follicles to make the procedure imperceptible.”&lt;/p&gt;

	For all the miraculous effects attributed to GLP-1s like Ozempic — from craving suppression to fighting inflammation — Hollywood’s favorite drugs do not defy the law of gravity. As they’ve grown in popularity and availability, so has the need for treatments that target that drooping skin that follows rapid weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Surgeons like New York-based Macrene Alexiades have made a specialty of it. “I have successfully treated and reversed GLP-1 sagginess in my patients with radiofrequency treatments for skin laxity reduction, combined with PRP plus artful strategic filler placement to restore key areas of atrophy,” Alexiades tells &lt;em&gt;THR&lt;/em&gt;. “Usually two treatment sessions, a month apart, is enough to achieve a full correction and restoration.”

	&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Dermatologist Simon Ourian, meanwhile, focuses “on restoring collagen and muscle mass, which are often depleted during rapid weight loss.” He says, “We use our proprietary [hyaluronic acid-based] Neustem regenerative protocol to rebuild structural support, enhance muscle tone, and restore vitality to the face and body without the risk of overfilling. For the body, we combine regenerative solutions with energy-based skin tightening and contouring to address loose skin and improve definition in areas like the abdomen, arms and thighs.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;

			
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Paul Jarrod Frank recommends second-generation scarless skin removal — a technique known as Ellacor fractional micro-coring — to treat crepey skin on the face, neck, arms, abdomen, legs and back. “Unlike microneedling, which punches holes in the skin and delivers heat, Ellacor punches holes and literally cores out just under a millimeter of skin, done thousands of times over each area to remove a significant percentage with each treatment,” the dermatologist explains. “The advantage is that you are removing, lifting and tightening skin without having to do a more aggressive surgical intervention. Holes close in 24 hours, with full recovery in five days.”

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Beverly Hills dermatologist Rhonda Rand (Angelina Jolie is a longtime client) leans into a combo of facial fillers, plus “radiofrequency microneedling to help tighten the skin and high-intensity focused ultrasound to stimulate collagen at deeper levels.” She tells &lt;em&gt;THR&lt;/em&gt;, “In severe cases of facial wasting, even a facelift would be appropriate. When the skin is sagging so much, noninvasive procedures may not be enough.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	GLP-1s have also ushered in a new wave of skin care products. Chicago-based plastic surgeon Julius Few (who has collaborated with Gwyneth Paltrow for Goop) recently added a $300 topical DermaReverse serum to his product line “designed specifically for GLP-1 users experiencing GLP Face” as well as a $195 Skin Tightening + SPF 30 with Dermatight to target sagging and laxity on the body. Image Skincare, which has a strong Hollywood following, has introduced $134 Vol.U.Lift, developed by the company’s plastic surgeon co-founder to address volume loss, sagging and other side effects of GLP-1 usage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva //  a-font-body-m     "&gt;
	Launching a whole new industry? Add it to that list of miraculous effects.&lt;/p&gt;

They wanted to explore the relationship between the human skin microbiome and psychological well-being, and they found a potential correlation. Turns out, skin care can not just improve the health of your skin and how it functions — it may also influence one’s mood and emotions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study uncovered that specific classifications of bacteria may have an impact on one’s well-being, with an emphasis on cutibacterium, an acne-causing bacterium.

			&lt;p&gt;A mysterious, orange gunk found in a bronze jar uncovered some 70 years ago at an ancient shrine near Pompeii, Italy, has finally been identified as honey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After several failed attempts over recent decades, researchers from the University of Oxford unraveled the strange substance's chemical degradation to reveal a sweet offering to an ancient Greek god 2,500 years ago; an&lt;span&gt; appropriate gift, given honey is said to be what Zeus ate as a child.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archeologist Luciana da Costa Carvalho and colleagues were able to detect a chemical fingerprint nearly identical to modern honey and beeswax using advanced &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography"&gt;gas chromatography&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry"&gt;mass spectrometry&lt;/a&gt; techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was more acidic though, as would be expected from long-term storage where the sugars degrade into &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furan"&gt;furans&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-traces-of-ancient-egyptian-hallucinogens-found-in-old-jug?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;First Traces of Ancient Egyptian Hallucinogens Found in Old Jug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also happens to beeswax, which was identified in one of the previous analyses, but the residue had a much more complicated composition to just be wax, the researchers argue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169274" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169274" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AncientGreekBronzeJarWithOrangeGunkContents.jpg" alt="Bronze jar with orange gunk in clear plastic container next to it" class="wp-image-169274 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AncientGreekBronzeJarWithOrangeGunkContents.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AncientGreekBronzeJarWithOrangeGunkContents-311x415.jpg 311w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AncientGreekBronzeJarWithOrangeGunkContents-600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169274" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Bronze jar on display at the Ashmolean Museum contained a mysterious substance (shown in the foreground in clear plastic).

Inside, bronze jars surrounded an empty iron bed accompanied by six &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydria"&gt;hydriai&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphora"&gt;amphorae&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169275" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169275" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AnalysisOfAncientHoney.jpg" alt="The honey's analytical journey illustrated" class="wp-image-169275 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AnalysisOfAncientHoney.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/AnalysisOfAncientHoney-600x325.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169275" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The honey's analytical journey visualized.

"Studying them reveals how those substances changed over time, opening the door to future work on ancient microbial activity and its possible applications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5c04888"&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globs of sticky goo discovered in the bottom of 2,500-year-old bronze jars from southern Italy have been chemically identified, settling a 70-year archaeological debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's honey — the sweet leftovers of an offering to an ancient god.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of chemists and archaeologists used cutting-edge analysis techniques to test the paste-like residue. They concluded that the jars, which were found in the sixth-century-B.C. city of Paestum, originally contained honeycomb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What I find interesting is that the ancient Greeks did think that honey was a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34693-superfoods.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34693-superfoods.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;superfood&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;," study lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1884-3121" target="_blank" data-url="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1884-3121" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Luciana da Costa Carvalho&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a chemist at the University of Oxford, said in a video. The researchers published their findings Wednesday (July 30) in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.5c04888" target="_blank" data-url="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.5c04888" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honey and honeybees were important in ancient Greek and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/romans" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/romans"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Roman&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; medicine, rituals, cosmetics and food. So when archaeologists found eight bronze jars in an underground shrine in 1954, they assumed that the jars contained honey as a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781003490180-1/historical-religious-perspective-honey-rajesh-kumar" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781003490180-1/historical-religious-perspective-honey-rajesh-kumar" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;symbol of immortality&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Despite at least four attempts over seven decades to confirm the presence of the sticky, sweet substance, no evidence of sugars was ever found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/chemistry/does-honey-ever-go-bad" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/chemistry/does-honey-ever-go-bad"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does honey ever go bad?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Carvalho and colleagues decided to take advantage of recent advances in chemical analysis techniques and to reopen the question of the gooey substance's origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-f5R4rZR2grXmAzNkWfJUDT" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-f5R4rZR2grXmAzNkWfJUDT slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mass spectrometry, a technique that can identify different molecules and compounds, Carvalho and colleagues identified intact hexose sugars in the ancient jar residue for the first time. Fresh honey is about 79% hexose sugars, the researchers wrote in the study, with fructose being the most abundant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of the proteins in the ancient sample revealed the presence of royal jelly, a milky secretion &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/how-do-bees-make-honey" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/how-do-bees-make-honey"&gt;&lt;u&gt;made by worker bees&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers also recovered peptides — short amino acid chains that are smaller versions of proteins — unique to one species of honeybee: the European honeybee (&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/bees-wasps/where-do-honey-bees-come-from-new-study-turns-the-standard-picture-on-its-head" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/animals/bees-wasps/where-do-honey-bees-come-from-new-study-turns-the-standard-picture-on-its-head"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Jars with sticky goo were discovered in the 1950s inside this underground shrine at Paestum. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Alamy)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding up these analyses, the researchers wrote that the study presents the first direct molecular evidence supporting the presence of honey, likely offered as honeycombs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The amount of sugar in the ancient residue is very low compared to modern honey," Carvalho told Live Science in an email. "I think the residue tastes like washed honeycomb but slightly more acidic," Carvalho said, although she did not actually try it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also identified copper ions in the honey mixture. Because these ions are biocidal, meaning they can kill microorganisms, "their presence would have contributed to the preservations of sugars on the surface of the residue," Carvalho said, potentially explaining how the honey lasted thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of the goop can help archaeologists better understand ancient rituals and shrines. The jars were found in an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Poseidonia,+Underground+Shrine&amp;amp;object=building" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Poseidonia,+Underground+Shrine&amp;amp;object=building" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;underground shrine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also called a heroon, at Paestum. The heroon also included a large, wooden table with wool-wrapped iron rods placed on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offering may have been made to Is of Helice, the mythical founder of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/sybaris" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/sybaris" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ancient Greek city of Sybaris&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, located in what today is the arch of Italy's boot. When Sybaris was destroyed in the sixth century B.C., its inhabitants fled and founded a city called Poseidonia. But when the Romans took it over in the third century B.C., they renamed the city Paestum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study shows that "there is merit in reanalyzing museum collections because analytical techniques continue to develop," Carvalho said in the video.&lt;/p&gt;

The guidance will appear at the end of the summer, before the winter respiratory season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Five other scientific groups – the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians – also plan to release vaccine guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The news comes amid growing changes to how vaccines are recommended by US officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy and other officials have also announced new restrictions on Covid vaccines, and Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;framed&lt;/a&gt; vaccination with the measles, mumps, and rubella shot as a “personal” choice during the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;worst US measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A new endeavor, the Vaccine Integrity Project, is now conducting a wide-ranging review of scientific studies on vaccines, due to wrap up in the next two to three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The volunteer-driven vaccine project is analyzing 16,400 publications on flu, Covid and RSV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The scientific groups will then draw upon that review to issue guidance for the populations they serve, including children, high-risk people, pregnant people and healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re not making recommendations ourselves. We’re just providing them with the information,” said Michael Osterholm, the epidemiologist heading the &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research &amp;amp; Policy (Cidrap).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It is an effort to take up the work done by the CDC’s independent advisory group, the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), since 1964.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“For the past five-plus decades, we have looked at the CDC as the authoritative source for guidance and information related to vaccines,” said Scott Rivkees, associate dean for education in the Brown University School of Public Health and former surgeon general of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now, “the medical community very much disagrees with” the current approach from health agencies, he said, and it is quickly pivoting from relying on CDC recommendations to collaborating on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Americans are facing an “information crisis” as official guidance falters, Osterholm said. “The CDC science has been corrupted”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Changing official health guidance “results in total confusion”, Rivkees said. “Who do you listen to? It really puts parents and families in an incredibly difficult situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Parents “have more questions now than before. We see more vaccine hesitancy than before. We see more vaccine refusal than before,” Rivkees continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“These changes that are happening now are the result of politics, not related to science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Organizations like the Vaccine Integrity Project and its collaboration with medical groups will be vital to “preserve what we know works” when it comes to protecting people from infectious diseases and other health issues, said Rivkees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The scientific groups already have expertise – and trust – in these areas, he said. Working together will help them make evidence-based, trustworthy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in May that the CDC would no longer recommend Covid vaccines during pregnancy, despite strong and consistent evidence that the vaccines are safe in pregnancy and that pregnancy is a major risk factor for severe illness and death from Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Immunization is especially important during pregnancy, when the risks of severe outcomes are heightened – and when vaccines can provide critical protection to the infant after birth,” Sandra E Brooks, CEO of ACOG, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The CDC also changed the pediatric Covid recommendation from “should” to “may” and FDA officials put greater restrictions on who may receive Covid boosters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet Covid remains a major threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This year, the number of hospitalizations, serious illnesses and deaths in kids from Covid exceeded that of influenza, and this was one of the worst influenza years in a decade,” Osterholm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Flu and RSV also pose major risks, and without recommendations from the CDC for annual boosters, those vaccines and preventives could face an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The respiratory vaccine guidance is only the beginning, Osterholm said. “This was just the first effort, because it was the most immediate need right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After this, the organization will focus on data for other routine vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The thought that we now have to care for more children with measles, more children with whooping cough than before, is really very unfortunate,” Rivkees said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I’m very afraid that this country is moving to a situation where some elements within our nation are going to accept children dying of measles, children dying of whooping cough, teenagers dying of meningitis, not getting vaccinated as the new normal. And the thought that we are going to now be able to think that this is acceptable is frankly terrifying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Outside guidance will help parents and providers navigate the evidence on vaccines, Rivkees said – and it may help insurers decide which vaccines to cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are required to cover vaccines recommended by ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“As ACIP makes changes to recommendations, then the question comes, are these vaccines going to continue to be covered or not? Whereas before insurance may pay for certain vaccines, maybe they won’t in the future, which means families will have to pay out of pocket,” Rivkees said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Decreases in vaccination could mean manufacturers make fewer vaccines or pull out of the market entirely. “The other thing that we’re also very worried about is what’s going to happen to the vaccine supply,” Rivkees said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Vaccines help insurers save money by preventing illness, Osterholm said. “But they’ve got to have a basis for making the decision that ‘we will support this,’ and that’s what we’re trying to provide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The outside recommendations are meant as a stopgap measure, Osterholm says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We need our old ACIP back. We need to have the kind of scientific expertise, based on the expertise in the community, to ensure the vaccine enterprise is healthy and exists,” Osterholm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re not, as the Vaccine Integrity Project, hoping that we exist for very long. We’d love to see us go away because of the return of ACIP and CDC leadership,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But, he said, “we know that that’s not going to happen, at least for the next few years”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNUWFvMWdPSlJ5OUM5QW8zZUdYVXRiTmgtRk5taUk1S09sV1lxem9SeDNvTkJ4VTNObm5rYzVTc2JKN0kyRGdoNzdPTENxT01ORTctQk9tQm5Gd3IxdEFJblpsQ1A2Q3EyUU4zMFhNdnBISGVzOWhqSWx3OHNuUGszMFZYOGE1ZnVQaWc</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，联邦食品援助计划可能会减缓认知能力下降- NBC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxPSG1TNTJidFE2NHplWUU5U1J3eDRHNWdQZllFb3FmVHRCak9DVlZ0cThndnBPZUo1cnhjZ2FySld6eWs4UmdwSHJUbFFhMGRsbnM2Mk9mRkJxOHBFLWtaeTFqZk12eVBpMGZCSzV6azQxS051d1A3UHk5d25Gc3ZQMktubXM0UjkySkgybXJZckU0SWE5UlRqTFJJdzlvV0pmWnpYVHduQVRkSXVXdHk0ZkZoaDU4NDY3NXljWThYYTVLZ9IBVkFVX3lxTE5VWDI4b1F2UHZ4a1EtdjFCYXp2Zjg0Y01DWWhpazRLbjQ0MFRUM1k4ZHBpT3NqWGFZNEY1RmRzdzVwUV9zVEo4MXBoOVhZRDkyQXI5U1V3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-46773b" class="body-graf"&gt;Older adults who participated in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, had a slower rate of cognitive decline than people who were eligible for the anti-hunger program but didn’t receive benefits, according to a study presented Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b4b62e" class="body-graf"&gt;Although many adults begin to mentally slow down in midlife, researchers found that people over 50 who participated in SNAP, which helps people with low incomes afford groceries, had a 10% slower rate of decline in their memory and thinking skills compared with their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe4f1e" class="body-graf"&gt;That’s equal to gaining two to three additional years of cognitive health over 10 years, said Linlin Da, lead author of the study, who presented her findings Wednesday at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-36d11d" class="body-graf"&gt;By providing a secure source of food, SNAP “may have some underappreciated benefits for brain health,” said Da, who led the study while she was a doctoral student at the University of Georgia College of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d60358" class="body-graf"&gt;The National Institutes of Health-funded study comes just weeks after President Donald Trump signed legislation that the Congressional Budget Office estimates &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-cuts-snap-for-millions-of-families.html" target="_blank"&gt;will cut funding&lt;/a&gt; for SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, by $186 billion through 2034. Food banks across the United States are already &lt;a href="https://wamu.org/story/25/06/04/dc-food-banks-usda-cuts/" target="_blank"&gt;struggling to meet growing demand&lt;/a&gt; amid funding cuts from the Agriculture Department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f4a270" class="body-graf"&gt;Food insecurity “can lead to poor nutrition and chronic disease, and all of that can negatively impact the brain,” Da said. “So by improving access to nutrient-rich foods, SNAP may support brain health, reduce the stress and promote better health overall.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1bd71" class="body-graf"&gt;The new study, which hasn’t yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, leaves many questions unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-53e4da" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers didn’t measure which foods study participants consumed, so they don’t know if people receiving SNAP benefits had healthier diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f81a7c" class="body-graf"&gt;But doctors know that high-sodium diets can raise blood pressure, one of the most important risk factors for dementia, said Dr. Mitchell Elkind, chief science officer for brain health and stroke at the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b701a5" class="body-graf"&gt;The study also doesn’t explain how food security might benefit the brain, said Elkind, who wasn’t involved with the research. It’s possible that programs such as SNAP relieve the anxiety that people feel when they can’t afford their groceries or when they have to choose between paying for food or medication, giving them more mental bandwidth to focus on other issues. Chronic stress &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-43884-3" target="_blank"&gt;has been linked to a higher risk&lt;/a&gt; for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c3953b" class="body-graf"&gt;The design of the new study, which followed more than 2,300 older people for 10 years, can’t definitively prove that participating in SNAP protects brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-430308" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s possible that people who participated in SNAP were cognitively healthier before the study began, Da said. Enrolling in SNAP can be time-consuming and complicated, making it more difficult for people with cognitive problems to complete their applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2946ae" class="body-graf"&gt;Yet a growing field of research &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622132578" target="_blank"&gt;links nutrition, food security and dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc811a" class="body-graf"&gt;“Observational studies from around the world have shown us that food insecurity and poor cognitive health go together,” said Kriti Jain, a health administrator at the National Institute on Aging, part of the NIH, who wasn’t involved in the study. “More recent studies have shown us that food insecurity comes before cognitive health gets worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a9eb3" class="body-graf"&gt;Brain health is shaped by far more than genetics, Da said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1cea94" class="body-graf"&gt;Cognitive aging “can also be shaped by policies, by the environment and by access to different resources,” she said. “That means we can do something to change it and improve it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8c5a30" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/anti-hunger-advocates-slam-house-republicans-proposed-cut-snap-rcna206484" target="_blank"&gt;Anti-hunger groups contend&lt;/a&gt; that cutting SNAP benefits will leave people hungry and less healthy. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7485412/#:~:text=A%20vital%20relationship%20exists%20between%20malnutrition%20and%20poverty.,the%20developing%20world%20(16)." target="_blank"&gt;Research shows that poverty&lt;/a&gt; and food insecurity — a condition in which people lack a consistent source of nutritious food —&lt;a href="https://frac.org/wp-content/uploads/hunger-is-a-health-issue-for-older-adults-1.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;are common risk factors&lt;/a&gt; for malnutrition among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-152f56" class="body-graf"&gt;“SNAP is both a lifeline for older adults and a critical public health tool,” said Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research &amp;amp; Action Center, an advocacy group. “Participating in SNAP can mean extra years of cognitive health, helping older adults remain independent,” instead of moving into nursing homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-720ff4" class="body-graf"&gt;The Republican-led House Agriculture Committee has said the funding reduction “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/anti-hunger-advocates-slam-house-republicans-proposed-cut-snap-rcna206484" target="_blank"&gt;restores SNAP to its original intent&lt;/a&gt;—promoting work, not welfare—while saving taxpayer dollars and investing in American agriculture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-e3e9b5" class="body-heading"&gt;Food as medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_small__gIJ9M styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-3b699c"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1998"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1240px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-360w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250729-Karen-Forbes-ch-1428-d7855b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-360w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250729-Karen-Forbes-ch-1428-d7855b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-320w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250729-Karen-Forbes-ch-1428-d7855b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-320w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250729-Karen-Forbes-ch-1428-d7855b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 758px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250729-Karen-Forbes-ch-1428-d7855b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250729-Karen-Forbes-ch-1428-d7855b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/250729-Karen-Forbes-ch-1428-d7855b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250729-Karen-Forbes-ch-1428-d7855b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250729-Karen-Forbes-ch-1428-d7855b.jpg" alt="Karen Forbes."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Karen Forbes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Karen Forbes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4006b1" class="body-graf"&gt;Karen Forbes, 61, first participated in SNAP decades ago when she was a single mother of a young child. She reapplied for the program during the pandemic when her pet sitting customers stopped needing her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-133507" class="body-graf"&gt;Forbes, who lives outside Portland, Oregon, said SNAP has been especially important since she developed long Covid in 2022, which has left her with heavy fatigue, prevents her from working and has caused “brain fog” that resembles age-related cognitive decline. Forbes said she and her father, who is 82, “are going through a sort of Alzheimer’s thing together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9738f5" class="body-graf"&gt;Although Forbes said she used to talk “a million miles a minute,” she now often struggles to find the right word. If she tries to speak too quickly, “everything comes out jumbled and stupid.” After an 18-month wait, Forbes said she recently began receiving disability benefits from Social Security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b0c839" class="body-graf"&gt;Because of SNAP, Forbes said, she doesn’t have to choose between buying groceries and paying her rent or electric bills. Her favorite part of SNAP is being able to afford fresh fruits and vegetables, she said. Oregon’s SNAP program &lt;a href="https://doubleuporegon.org/markets/" target="_blank"&gt;provides “double benefits” for shopping&lt;/a&gt; at farmers markets, so people can buy twice as much fresh produce for the same amount of money.

Twenty-three percent of such families faced chronic or recurring food insecurity from 2015 to 2019, according to a survey from the NIH &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38427343/" target="_blank"&gt;published last year in JAMA Health Forum&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-26aaad" class="body-graf"&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article-abstract/79/11/gbae153/7750664?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=true" target="_blank"&gt;study published last year&lt;/a&gt; found that food insecurity doubled the risk of probable cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1f5289" class="body-graf"&gt;And a paper published in 2024 in the Journal of Nutrition found that adults with food insecurity and lower-quality diets &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623728319" target="_blank"&gt;had significantly steeper declines in cognitive scores&lt;/a&gt; during the study, conducted from 2012 to 2020. In that study, however, participating in SNAP wasn’t related to the rate of mental decline, suggesting that SNAP alone “may be insufficient to prevent negative cognitive effects of poor diet and limited access to nutritious foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-382c2b" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unprecedented cutbacks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ff18fb" class="body-graf"&gt;The Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization that focuses on social and economic policy, &lt;a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/how-senate-budget-reconciliation-snap-proposals-will-affect-families-every-us" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that funding cuts could lead 22.3 million families to lose some or all of their food benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-37416c" class="body-graf"&gt;The 20% decrease in funding is “the largest cut to SNAP in history,” &lt;a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/by-the-numbers-senate-republican-leaderships-reconciliation-bill-takes#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20the%20bill%20puts,need%20to%20grow%20and%20thrive." target="_blank"&gt;according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities&lt;/a&gt;, a nonpartisan think tank.

&lt;p class="has-drop-cap"&gt;We now live in the &lt;strong&gt;Pyrocene&lt;/strong&gt;, a proposed new &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale"&gt;geologic epoch&lt;/a&gt; of high wildfire activity brought about by human-caused climate change. The occurrence of extreme fire weather is now roughly double compared to the preindustrial period, according to a study released just this week. The Pyrocene has brought a long summer of wildfire smoke in 2025 across North America, where plumes have disrupted outdoor plans for millions of residents. The worst smoke is blowing from the intense fires burning in central Canada, which has already experienced its third-worst fire season on record. But fire activity in the Western U.S. is beginning to ramp up as well, with major wildfires in Arizona and in Utah creating increasing amounts of unhealthy smoke in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-bluesky-social wp-block-embed-bluesky-social"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smoke problems will likely intensify across the continent through August and probably well into September. The next major smoke episode to affect the Upper Midwest is now underway, with the smoke poised to move deep into the central U.S. by this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in the Pyrocene means a new reality: knowing what the latest wildfire smoke forecasts are, in order to plan your outdoor activities. We review below the best tools to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Wildfire smoke forecasts are often inaccurate &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that forecasting wildfire smoke is HARD, and model forecasts are often way off – either high or low. The models to forecast smoke are in their infancy, and not only do forecasters have to get the meteorology right, they also have to get fire behavior and atmospheric chemistry right – including how the smoke interacts with clouds and rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-bluesky-social wp-block-embed-bluesky-social"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A case in point: You would think that a heavy rainstorm would clean the air of smoke – and it often does – but at my house in southeast Michigan in June, pollution from the main health-damaging component of wildfire smoke, PM 2.5, increased to the red “Unhealthy” level during a six-hour rain storm that dumped over a half-inch of rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read: &lt;a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2021/05/silent-calamity-the-health-impacts-of-wildfire-smoke/"&gt;Silent calamity: The health impacts of wildfire smoke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This counterintuitive event occurred when the circulation associated with the rain storm pulled down particles from an elevated plume of smoke overhead. Worse, the models didn’t know that the elevated plume was there and did not properly forecast the increase in my Air Quality Index, or AQI. When the models finally did show an extensive band of “Unhealthy” air, the forecast for the placement of the band was displaced by several hundred miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/observed-predicted-PM2.5-jun5.png?resize=974%2C300&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="Two maps of the Upper Midwest show the predicted and observed PM 2.5 on June 5, 2025 " class="wp-image-129929" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/observed-predicted-PM2.5-jun5.png?w=974&amp;amp;ssl=1 974w, https://i0.wp.com/yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/observed-predicted-PM2.5-jun5.png?resize=300%2C92&amp;amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/observed-predicted-PM2.5-jun5.png?resize=768%2C237&amp;amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/observed-predicted-PM2.5-jun5.png?resize=780%2C240&amp;amp;ssl=1 780w, https://i0.wp.com/yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/observed-predicted-PM2.5-jun5.png?resize=400%2C123&amp;amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/observed-predicted-PM2.5-jun5.png?w=370&amp;amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 1. Predicted surface PM 2.5 levels seven hours into the future from NOAA’s AQM v7 model (left) vs. observed PM 2.5 (right) valid at 9 a.m. EDT June 5, 2025. A band of red “Unhealthy” air was predicted to extend from southern Wisconsin to the northeast over northern Lower Michigan, but the band actually occurred several hundred miles to the southeast.

&lt;p&gt;Satellites are good at telling us how much total smoke is present in a column from the surface to the top of the atmosphere, but not at the concentrations of smoke at various elevations, which you typically need to make a good smoke forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the satellites used by some models pass over a specific area only once a day. As a result, if a fire starts after the satellites pass over or if the fire significantly changes size after the satellite passes, that information will not be in the forecast until the following day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, smoke forecasts are often way off, particularly beyond one day. This is particularly so if new fires start or if established fires diminish because of firefighting efforts or precipitation. Smoke models typically do not allow for fires to spread horizontally, and they have to make assumptions about how high the smoke plume will rise, what type of vegetation is burning, what chemical reactions will affect the smoke, and other hard-to-quantify factors. A &lt;a href="https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2024-107/gmd-2024-107.pdf"&gt;2024 paper&lt;/a&gt; documenting NOAA’s AQMv7 model said it this way: &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;the AQMv7 demonstrates large bias/error for PM2.5 near and downstream of wildfire sources in the western U.S., indicating uncertainties in fire emissions, transport, and plume chemistry.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to use smoke model forecasts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use multiple models to understand your wildfire smoke risk, and check the initial smoke concentrations the models are using at the beginning of their runs to see if they match the actual concentrations. Put more trust in models that get the initial conditions right! (But even if a smoke forecast does not get the absolute levels of PM 2.5 right, it can be useful to see trends.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look particularly closely where major fires are burning. Sometimes the models do not know where fires are burning because of cloud cover, or they assume that there is a major source of smoke where fires may have suddenly died down. I’ve seen errors in the assumed starting concentrations of smoke of over a factor of 10, for both underestimates and overestimates. Errors are more likely to occur when dense cloud cover is over major fires, preventing accurate satellite estimates of fire intensity and initial smoke concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that PM 2.5 particles are also emitted by many other human sources, such as cars, power plants, and industrial activity. It is good to know the total PM 2.5 levels from all sources, not just wildfire smoke. During a wildfire smoke episode on a hot summer day with light winds, PM 2.5 from smoke often will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be the dominant source of total PM 2.5, particularly in cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to check your current air quality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend these sources of current PM 2.5 data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EPA’s &lt;a href="https://fire.airnow.gov/#4.45/43.56/-86.69"&gt;Fire and Smoke Map&lt;/a&gt;, which includes data from official EPA monitors and four kinds of low-cost backyard sensors, most notably from purpleair.com&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://map.purpleair.com/1/mAQI/a10/p604800/cC0#3.92/41.56/-83.28"&gt;Purpleair.com&lt;/a&gt;, a company that has a huge global network of low-cost backyard PM2.5 sensors. I’ve had one in my backyard for over 10 years and have been very pleased with it (the cost is $239-$299). Note that these inexpensive devices are known to read about 10-40% too high during episodes of intense wildfire smoke, depending upon the levels of smoke, according to a 2024 study. The purpleair.com site allows you to apply the appropriate correction factor: At the upper left of the map, click on the text, “US EPA PM2.5 AQI,” then choose the “Apply Conversion” option, then select “US EPA.” The purpleair.com site also allows you to display current PM 2.5 levels as AQI or concentrations in micrograms per cubic meter, with the latter option being handy to compare to what smoke models are predicting.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/land/hms.html#maps"&gt;NOAA Hazard Mapping System Fire and Smoke Product&lt;/a&gt; has an interactive map of smoke plumes and fire locations. There is also a twice-per-day &lt;a href="https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/spl/includes/fire/current_text.html"&gt;text analysis of the smoke situation&lt;/a&gt;, plus areas where blowing dust is occurring, based on satellite analyses.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iqair.com/air-quality-map"&gt;IQAir&lt;/a&gt; has a nice global map of current PM 2.5, including a fancy &lt;a href="https://www.iqair.com/earth?nav="&gt;3D map on a rotatable sphere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;For Canada and Alaska, &lt;a href="https://aqmap.ca/aqmap/en/#4/58.55/-107.24/B31/L38/L40/L41"&gt;aqmap.ca&lt;/a&gt; has a map with PM 2.5 observations from official monitors and four types of backyard sensors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EPA human-generated forecasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the gold standard for knowing how smoke will impact air quality is information at EPA’s &lt;a href="https://www.airnow.gov/national-maps/"&gt;AirNow.gov&lt;/a&gt;. It provides a graphical air quality forecast for today and tomorrow and offers links for text-based air quality forecasts from the state air quality department, where available. These will specifically discuss wildfire smoke when it is expected to reduce air quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt; The highest-quality smoke forecasts available, combining model data with expert human interpretation. The forecasts are also available on the excellent (and free) AirNow app.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Forecasts only go out one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment Canada human-generated forecasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Canada, &lt;a href="https://weather.gc.ca/mainmenu/airquality_menu_e.html"&gt;Environment Canada&lt;/a&gt; has three-day text-based forecasts of its &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/about.html"&gt;Air Quality Health Index (AQHI)&lt;/a&gt;, which includes the impact of wildfire smoke. Environment Canada’s &lt;a href="https://weather.gc.ca/"&gt;Interactive Weather Alerts map&lt;/a&gt; shows where Air Quality Warnings and Air Quality Statements are in effect. Clicking on the appropriate location will bring up text with the smoke forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt; The highest-quality Canadian smoke forecasts available, combining model data with expert human interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer model wildfire smoke forecasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer models to predict surface wildfire smoke concentrations are run by multiple agencies in the U.S. and Canada. These models are relatively new — the first operational smoke model, HRRR-Smoke, came online in 2020. Improvements are coming at a rapid pace. The output from the models for the main health-damaging component of wildfire smoke, PM 2.5, is expressed in micrograms per cubic meter, so you will have to know the conversion factor to get the Air Quality Index (AQI). In the U.S., the EPA standard for 24-hour PM 2.5 levels is 35 micrograms per cubic meter, which corresponds to an AQI of 100 (orange, “Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups”). The threshold for the red “Unhealthy” range is 55.4 micrograms per cubic meter, which corresponds to an AQI of 150. You can use EPA’s &lt;a href="https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-calculator/"&gt;AQI Calculator&lt;/a&gt; to do these conversions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the U.S. 24-hour PM 2.5 standard of 35 micrograms per cubic meter is set higher than it should be, according to many recent scientific studies: Breathing PM 2.5 has increasingly been found to cause more severe health problems than previously realized. The Canadian 24-hour PM 2.5 standard is 27 micrograms per cubic meter, and the international World Meteorological Organization standard is just 15 micrograms per cubic meter, equivalent to an AQI of 62 on the U.S. scale. I develop a cough if I breathe outside air for more than a few minutes when the PM 2.5 AQI from wildfire smoke reaches about 60 – close to the WMO standard, and I believe that the EPA boundary for an AQI of 100 – the beginning of the orange “Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups” range – should be at the WMO standard of 15 micrograms per cubic meter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, I give an overview of seven computer model forecasts of wildfire smoke and/or total PM 2.5. It is important to realize that your health is affected by total PM 2.5 – the combination of small particles from wildfire smoke plus other sources, such as car exhaust, power plants, and factory emissions. Many smoke models (like NOAA’s flagship HRRR-Smoke model) only give PM 2.5 levels from wildfire smoke, which will underestimate the total health burden of all of the PM 2.5 in the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. wildfire smoke models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. air quality model I like the most for predicting wildfire smoke is &lt;a href="https://airquality.weather.gov/?element=apm25h01_bc&amp;amp;mapcenter=-96.00%2C40.00&amp;amp;mapzoom=5&amp;amp;subregion=CONUS&amp;amp;region=CONUS"&gt;NOAA’s Air Quality Model (AQM v7)&lt;/a&gt;, which became operational in 2024. It provides hourly pollution forecasts for North America going out three days. From the “Air Quality Elements” drop-down menu, select “Bias-Corrected PM2.5,” which will display PM 2.5 forecasts from all sources, including wildfire smoke. There are options to plot hourly, 24-hour average, or maximum daily PM 2.5. The numbers shown on the images are in micrograms per cubic meter, but the colors are contoured with colors corresponding to the AQI scale (green, yellow, orange, red, purple, and brown) so that you don’t have to mentally convert from micrograms per cubic meter to AQI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt; Shows levels of total surface PM2.5, not just from smoke (emissions from cars, factories, etc. are often the dominant source of PM2.5); output shows both micrograms per cubic meter and AQI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Lower resolution (13 km); runs only twice per day (midnight and noon UTC, which is 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. EDT); data doesn’t arrive until about seven hours after initialization time.&lt;/p&gt;

Surface smoke forecast from the 18 UTC (2 p.m. EDT) Thursday, July 29 run of NOAA’s HRRR-Smoke model, valid at 8 a.m. EDT Thursday, July 31. PM 2.5 levels in excess of an AQI of 100 (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups) from smoke only is predicted for Minnesota. Two larges wildfires in the Western U.S. are predicted to bring “Unhealthy” (red) levels of smoke to Arizona and Utah. Note that total PM 2.5 levels are not shown here, and will be much higher, because of additional pollution from cars, heavy industry, power plants, etc. The legend at the bottom has been modified to show AQI info. (Image credit: &lt;a href="https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/HRRRsmoke/Welcome.cgi"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other U.S. model I like to use is &lt;a href="https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/HRRRsmoke/"&gt;HRRR-Smoke&lt;/a&gt;, the top operational U.S. model for forecasting wildfire smoke. The meteorology is done by the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model, which also provides 48-hour weather forecasts nationwide with a fine grid resolution of three kilometers. HRRR-Smoke makes 18-hour smoke forecasts every hour and 48-hour smoke forecasts every six hours (at 0, 6, 12, and 18 GMT) for the U.S. (there is a separate version of the model for Alaska, &lt;a href="https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/HRRR-AKsmoke/"&gt;HRRR-AK Smoke&lt;/a&gt;). The most useful option to predict air quality is “near-surface smoke.” There are also options to look at the smoke 1,000 feet high, 6,000 feet high, and through the whole depth of the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt; The highest-resolution computer smoke model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Includes PM 2.5 only from smoke, not from human emissions or blowing dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/RAPsmoke/"&gt;RAP-Smoke&lt;/a&gt; is a coarser resolution (13 km) U.S. model useful for predicting smoke transport on a regional level. Forecasts go out 21 hours and are generated every hour. The model runs considerably faster than HRRR-Smoke, so data is available several hours sooner. The &lt;a href="https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/HRRRsmoke/HRRR-Smoke_VIIRS_Activefire_user_guide.pdf"&gt;RAP- and HRRR-Smoke User’s Guide&lt;/a&gt; has details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global wildfire smoke models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model I like the most for long-range smoke forecasts for North America is &lt;a href="https://fluid.nccs.nasa.gov/wxmaps/chem2d/?stream=G5FPFC&amp;amp;field=pm25sfc&amp;amp;level=0&amp;amp;region=nam"&gt;NASA’s GEOS-FP model&lt;/a&gt; (Goddard Earth Observing System Forward Processing). The early run (0 UTC or 8 p.m. EDT) goes out a full 10 days, the longest of any smoke/PM 2.5 model. The late run (12 UTC or 8 a.m. EDT) makes five-day forecasts. Keep in mind that forecasts more than a few days in advance will be highly inaccurate! This is particularly so if new fires start or if established fires diminish because of firefighting efforts or precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt; Global; forecasts all PM 2.5 (from smoke plus human-emitted air pollution); only model to make ultra long-range PM 2.5 forecasts (10 days)&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Coarse resolution (about 25 km); data not available until about 11 hours after the initialization time; grids are continental-scale, making it hard to see local detail; inaccuracy: I’ve seen the model incorrectly initialize smoke levels, resulting in a PM 2.5 forecast five times too high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/charts/packages/cams/products/particulate-matter-forecasts?base_time=202506060000&amp;amp;layer_name=composition_pm2p5&amp;amp;projection=classical_north_america&amp;amp;valid_time=202506060300"&gt;CAMS&lt;/a&gt; (the European Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring System) provides five-day global forecasts of PM 2.5 that include wildfire smoke. There is a 10-km higher-&lt;a href="https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/charts/packages/cams_air_quality/products/europe-air-quality-forecast-regulated?base_time=202506060000&amp;amp;layer_name=composition_europe_pm2p5_forecast_surface&amp;amp;level=key_0&amp;amp;originating_centre=85_2&amp;amp;projection=opencharts_europe&amp;amp;valid_time=202506060000"&gt;resolution version of the model for Europe&lt;/a&gt; (and in France, the &lt;a href="https://www.prevair.org/"&gt;PREVAIR model&lt;/a&gt; offers five-day PM 2.5 forecasts for that nation). &lt;a href="https://www.windy.com/-Menu/menu?cams,pm2p5,42.377,-82.915,5"&gt;Windy.com&lt;/a&gt; has a nice interface on its website (and on the free version of its app) to display the CAMS data on its animated map with wind streamlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt; Global; forecasts all PM 2.5 (from smoke plus human-emitted air pollution); one of only two long-range PM 2.5 forecast models (five days).&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Coarse resolution (about 40 km), and the grids it runs on are large, so it’s hard to see local detail; runs only once per day (at 0Z); the minimum concentration of the contours is set too high (20 micrograms per cubic meter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://silam.fmi.fi/aqforecast.html"&gt;SILAM model from the Finnish Meteorological Institute&lt;/a&gt; has a seven-day global PM 2.5 forecast with a grid available for the CONUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS: &lt;/strong&gt;Long-range, seven-day forecasts available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Coarse resolution; can’t save the URL for the CONUS grid in a bookmark, so you must navigate from the default European map to get the CONUS map.&lt;/p&gt;

Environment Canada surface PM 2.5 forecast from the 12 UTC (8 a.m. EDT) Thursday, July 29 model run, valid at 8 a.m. EDT Thursday, July 31. PM 2.5 levels in excess of an AQI of 100 (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups) is predicted for much of the Upper Midwest, as well as multiple Canadian provinces. Note that I modified the legend at the side to show AQI info, and the colors used in the map do not correspond to the standard AQI colors used by the U.S. EPA. For example, light green on this map corresponds to an AQI of 100, which is color-coded orange (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups) in the U.S. EPA system.(Image credit: &lt;a href="https://weather.gc.ca/firework/firework_anim_e.html?type=pt&amp;amp;utc=12"&gt;Environment Canada&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canadian wildfire smoke models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another of the top-five smoke models I like is Environment Canada’s &lt;a href="https://weather.gc.ca/firework/"&gt;three-day air quality forecast&lt;/a&gt; for North America from its Air Quality Model of surface PM 2.5, updated twice daily at &lt;a href="https://weather.gc.ca/firework/firework_anim_e.html?type=pt&amp;amp;utc=00"&gt;0 UTC&lt;/a&gt; (which updates around 1 a.m. EDT) and &lt;a href="https://weather.gc.ca/firework/firework_anim_e.html?type=pt&amp;amp;utc=12"&gt;12 UTC&lt;/a&gt; (which updates around 1 p.m. EDT). Imagery for total PM 2.5 from all sources, and just from smoke, is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt; Forecasts all PM 2.5 (from smoke plus human-emitted air pollution); provides three-day forecasts; has zoom-in maps for Canadian provinces; decent grid resolution (10 km).&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Does not initialize smoke concentrations well in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://firesmoke.ca/"&gt;FireSmoke Canada&lt;/a&gt; (AKA The BlueSky Canada Smoke Forecasting System) produces a two-day surface smoke forecast that shows the locations of current major wildfires. There are options to see the hourly, daily average, and daily maximum smoke levels. It’s produced by the Weather Forecast Research Team at the University of British Columbia. It has an &lt;a href="https://firesmoke.ca/forecasts/BSC00WC04-01/current/"&gt;experimental forecast for Western Canada&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROS:&lt;/strong&gt; Shows boundaries of active fires; decent grid resolution of 12 kilometers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONS:&lt;/strong&gt; Accuracy – I’ve seen the model improperly initialize smoke conditions, giving PM 2.5 levels over 10 times too high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimental U.S. wildfire smoke models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/RRFS-SD/"&gt;RRFS-SmokeDust&lt;/a&gt; (the Rapid Refresh Forecasting System Smoke and Dust model) is NOAA’s next-generation, soon-to-be-operational weather-smoke forecasting model. RRFS-SmokeDust makes 18-hour smoke forecasts every hour and 3.5-day smoke forecasts every six hours (at 0, 6, 12, and 18 GMT) for the U.S. The three-kilometer high-resolution model has improved physics, data assimilation, and handling of meteorology compared to HRRR-Smoke. It’s slower to run than HRRR-Smoke and has only one large domain covering North America. It includes PM 2.5 from both smoke and dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/RAPchem/"&gt;RAP-Chem&lt;/a&gt; is an even fancier experimental model that does two-day forecasts of a number of air pollutants, including PM2.5, NOx, CO, and ozone. It forecasts not just smoke but all PM2.5, including the background levels of pollution from cars and power plants. The model runs once per day, at 6 UTC (2 a.m. EDT), and is rather slow to run: The 24-hour forecast point is typically available after 10 hours (around noon EDT), and the 48-hour forecast point comes in around 3 p.m. EDT. Data is not always available since it is experimental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://tools.airfire.org/websky/v2/#status"&gt;U.S. Forest Service BlueSky modeling system&lt;/a&gt; is a suite of tools that allows you to combine a number of weather models, air pollution models, fire models, and smoke transport models. The tools are particularly valuable for showing high-resolution forecasts of wildfire smoke in the Western U.S. The EPA’s Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System (CMAQ) model is the main tool used to make the PM 2.5 forecasts. The U.S. Forest Service also has a portal, &lt;a href="https://portal.airfire.org/"&gt;Wildland Fire/Air Quality Tools&lt;/a&gt;, which has BlueSky and other useful air quality info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Pacific Northwest smoke model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://airpact.wsu.edu/map.html?v=0.003"&gt;AIRPACT&lt;/a&gt; is a high-resolution (4 km) air pollution model, which includes wildfire smoke, providing three-day PM 2.5 forecasts for the U.S. Pacific Northwest. It forecasts all PM 2.5 (from smoke plus human-emitted air pollution) and has the option to display PM 2.5 as AQI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apps for forecasting wildfire smoke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are over 100 air quality apps for smartphones that provide PM 2.5 forecasts, and it is beyond the scope of this post to present a review of them. The most popular apps — like Plume Labs (integrated into AccuWeather) and AirVisual from IQAir — do not offer forecasts from any of the smoke models listed above, like HRRR-Smoke, CAMS, or FireWork. There are, however, at least three apps that may be more valuable, because they do offer wildfire smoke forecasts from some of the advanced smoke models:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Google Weather App&lt;/strong&gt; (built-in on many Android/Pixel phones) includes PM 2.5 forecasts with smoke model data sourced from BreezoMeter. (Note that the built-in weather app on iPhones offers only current AQI from BreezoMeter, not an AQI forecast.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaia GPS&lt;/strong&gt; (free 14-day trial) includes a “Smoke Forecast” overlay in the map layers that uses &lt;strong&gt;HRRR-Smoke&lt;/strong&gt; model output. It offers real-time (current), 24-hour, and 48-hour smoke forecast maps at three-kilometer resolution across the continental U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.windy.com/"&gt;Windy.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has a dedicated &lt;strong&gt;surface PM 2.5&lt;/strong&gt; forecast layer powered by the European CAMS model. The free version of the app offers four-day PM 2.5 forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

And if that’s happening night after night for years, it adds up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Early diagnosis, therefore, is critical—but it’s currently falling short. Diagnosis frequently relies on a partner noticing loud snoring, an unreliable signal at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“The reality is, women—and especially pregnant women—have been overlooked when it comes to sleep disorders,” says Brown. “Right now, our diagnostic standards for sleep apnea are based on a very narrow demographic—typically middle-aged men. But we know that women present differently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“What’s classified as ‘mild’ apnea in a man could be moderate or even severe in a woman, particularly during pregnancy,” she adds. “We’ve supported research in pregnant women that found even mild sleep-disordered breathing was an independent risk factor for maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Wearable tech companies are racing to fill the diagnostic gap. Samsung’s Galaxy Watch recently became the first wearable to receive De Novo authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for detecting signs of OSA. But experts remain cautious. “Wearables and home sleep tests are improving, but they’re not yet a replacement for a full clinical diagnosis,” says Malhotra. “They can give a false sense of security—people see a score and think they’re fine when they’re not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Mander is also skeptical: “They’re not accurate enough to replace proper diagnosis,” he says. “They might be better than nothing—as long as you treat them as one piece of information, not the full picture.” While smartwatches and rings can track metrics like heart rate variability, they’re still not reliable at detecting breathing patterns, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The gold standard in diagnosis is polysomnography, a clinical sleep study that monitors brain waves, oxygen, heart rate, and muscle activity. But this is expensive and time-consuming, and doesn't scale well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;New home-based devices are now offering better options. Mander highlights WatchPAT, which uses finger, wrist, and chest sensors to detect apnea events by analyzing changes in blood vessels. There’s also ARES, a wearable headband monitor that measures airflow, oxygen levels, and sleep position, and NightOwl, a fingertip device that received FDA approval in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“It's a big step forward, especially for reaching underserved populations who might not be able to access a sleep lab,” Mander says. Still, there are limitations. “Right now, the home test doesn’t know if you’re awake or asleep, much less the sleep stage. It would probably miss people with REM-dominant OSA,” he says. “If we have devices that can detect when these events are happening—in REM versus non-REM—that could help us pick up people earlier and reduce their risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Once diagnosed, CPAP—continuous positive airway pressure—remains the gold standard for treatment, despite being uncomfortable or claustrophobic for some users. It uses a small machine to deliver a steady stream of air through a mask, keeping the airway open during sleep. “CPAP improves symptoms, blood pressure, and we now have emerging evidence that it may reduce cardiovascular risk,” says Malhotra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;For those who can’t tolerate CPAP, new tools such as nasal inserts are emerging on the market. Some interventions are more unconventional—and yet surprisingly effective. “There’s an Australian study that showed learning the didgeridoo helped strengthen throat muscles and reduce OSA severity,” says Mander. “It’s a fun example, but it works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Ultimately, the most critical step is awareness. “We used to think snoring was just annoying or funny,” Malhotra says. “Now we understand that it can be a sign of a serious medical condition. If you snore heavily or feel constantly tired, don’t just brush it off—go see your doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5sRndaUE5ZejRsMzdoZEFHY3g3ejJ0eWFoYWNrSGc3MjBTUGI2T0VBU0ZHQWk5MTg1U1ZXbUUxdUlEUlZfOU5IWG0yd2xZVjFTVFdoejM0M0RqZ1ZIbzJsdkFkV25FQXpQZXc2ZG1lSzRoczdr</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，粮食援助福利与老年人认知能力下降缓慢有关- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxOcTR3d3lYRW9JcVpBc1RYdGoxV3ZLTWtMeFE3RUF4dHRFUEcxMk5CVkg4SjhPcVdXNE5jNXVDd0tEVy1sWVNDYUc1TWpvd051SXprOXhjSFFtQVhpZVBqWVcweTIyRHgySEhmMF9zS0pkZ1RVN3BYT3Z2VjJZbGhGS1N5cEF5cXY2bzZSetIBkgFBVV95cUxQWVVUUTVNYkYzeW1sYXdhU3MwM1hhMVN2ejg1Z0laSDRtUEZFNUhTbkFHWmkxNUVlcGVfUzJzV0F6Mndtdm5oZ1p0MzIwb2RvYWtMaUtOdW1xLXh4dnM0SE4zUlRKaVAxaWZhR1BScGhTN2dZd2JJZDFFR0wzbkZvaGF6WloyRjZlT2NTN21DdTR1QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            For older adults who may otherwise be food-insecure, participating in food assistance benefits&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;may be associated with a slower cognitive decline as they age, according to new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdor1ia100043b6nk0vohmro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Compared with eligible people who were not participating in the &lt;a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program" target="_blank"&gt;US Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program&lt;/a&gt;, SNAP participants showed a slower decline in cognitive function during a 10-year period, essentially maintaining up to three additional years of cognitive health, according to the study presented Wednesday at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Toronto.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdor1ia100053b6nrqj8ahjl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We expected that SNAP might be protective for cognitive health based on prior research linking food insecurity to faster cognitive decline. But what did surprise us was the persistence of the effect over a decade — and the fact that the benefit was equivalent to preserving two to three extra years of cognitive health,” Linlin Da, lead author of the study and a Ph.D. candidate in health services research at the University of Georgia, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdor1ia100063b6n1kiwsszl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This study is important because it shows that supporting basic needs like food access can have long-term benefits for brain health, something not widely recognized,” Da said. “In a time when we’re seeking ways to delay or prevent Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia, this suggests that public health and social policy can play a role alongside medical approaches.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoqyl5s00003b6n9qtaifix@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s estimated that nearly 37% of SNAP participants are in households with older adults or people with disabilities, and on average, SNAP participants may receive an estimated $6.16 per day per person in benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdor1ia100083b6ncj1kcw24@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            SNAP, known previously as the Food Stamp Program, helped an average of more than 41 million low-income people in the United States in a typical month last year, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/the-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap" target="_blank"&gt;Center on Budget and Policy Priorities&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdor1ia100093b6ny1vlnmg4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act makes the largest cuts to food stamps in the program’s 86-year history, jeopardizing assistance for millions of people. The nonpartisan &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48552#:~:text=The%20Congressional%20Budget%20Office%20(CBO,all%20estimated%20to%20reduce%20spending." target="_blank"&gt;Congressional Budget Office&lt;/a&gt; estimates that the law will reduce federal spending on SNAP by almost $187 billion over the next decade.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdowxwg000033b6nxia0nzz9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some public health experts worry that while cuts to SNAP would lead to budgetary savings, it also could produce higher rates of food insecurity and poorer health outcomes in the long run, according to &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/the-implications-of-federal-snap-spending-cuts-on-individuals-with-medicaid-and-other-health-coverage/" target="_blank"&gt;the nonprofit KFF&lt;/a&gt;, formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation. And some Democratic state leaders are warning about potential consequences.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdox3b7l00063b6naz2wazob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “During a time when many American families are already struggling, food assistance programs such as SNAP are more essential than ever,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker &lt;a href="https://gov-pritzker-newsroom.prezly.com/gov-pritzker-and-local-leaders-discuss-impact-of-trumps-food-assistance-cuts" target="_blank"&gt;said in a news release&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday. “Under the veneer of ‘cost savings,’ the Trump Administration is slashing benefits and threatening the well-being of hundreds of thousands of Illinoisans, putting their health and welfare at risk. Our state deserves better.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdor1ia1000a3b6nak14rbg2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers on the new study, from the University of Georgia, analyzed data on more than 2,000 adults 50 and older across the United States. About half of them were enrolled in SNAP in 2010, and the other half were eligible for SNAP but did not participate in the program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdor1ia1000c3b6nd22gyg7d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Every two years between 2010 and 2020, the researchers interviewed the study participants to assess their cognition, memory and executive function, including their ability to carry out tasks or to plan. Each person was given a cognitive score based on the assessments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovdrnt00013b6nbmnh5j5v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The assessments, which have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, showed that those enrolled in SNAP had a slower rate of cognitive decline in cognition, memory and executive function during the 10-year period.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdor1ia1000d3b6nllwq67gi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The decline in global cognitive function was 0.10 points slower per year for SNAP participants compared to nonparticipants,” Da said. “While that may sound small, over a 10-year period, this adds up to about one full point of preserved cognition. To put it in clinical terms, this slower decline could delay the onset of mild cognitive impairment by nearly a decade for someone starting at a healthy cognitive baseline.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdor1ia1000e3b6ngz8nnsys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the researchers analyzed their data by race and ethnicity, they found that there was a slightly faster decline in cognition and memory among Black and Hispanic adults compared with White adults, but no significant racial differences were observed for executive function. However, SNAP participation was linked with much stronger cognitive benefits and slower decline among the White adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdor1ia1000g3b6n89tdnnva@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a 10-year study, the new research covers “a good length of time” to determine the benefits of diet and SNAP as associated with cognitive health, Dr. Shae Datta, a neurologist at NYU Langone Health and brand partner for the supplement company &lt;a href="https://www.qunol.com/collections/brain-health" target="_blank"&gt;Qunol&lt;/a&gt;, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdor1ia1000h3b6nvwraa2bs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Having the means to buy nutritious food is important for preventing cognitive decline,” said Datta, who was not involved in the new study. “This study suggested that SNAP participation, or any nutritional support program can delay the onset of cognitive impairment or dementia. Translating in a greater ability to manage their activities of daily living and remain independent longer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdor1ia1000i3b6nlwcgpktf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the new study suggests only an association between SNAP participation and cognitive decline, rather than a causal relationship, the researchers emphasized that not having adequate access to food can negatively affect cognitive function. SNAP participation may help improve someone’s nutritional intake, thus potentially slowing cognitive decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdor1ia1000k3b6nasme7p9h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When people don’t have access to healthy nutrition programs, they may have inadequate intake of, for example, brain healthy fats, omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, fish like lake trout, mackerel, herring, albacore tuna, sardines and wild salmon,” said preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida, who was not involved in the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Having a balanced diet can neutralize a lot of the risk elements related to developing cognitive decline. The way that I would think about this is, the Mediterranean-style diet is by far the most evidence-based when it comes to reducing the risk of cognitive decline,” Isaacson said. “But a Mediterranean-style diet is rich in green, leafy vegetables. Vegetables are expensive. Fatty fish are expensive. So nutrition assistance programs can really fill the gap.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdor1ia1000m3b6nzhn3lmdq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/13/health/mediterranean-diet-dementia-wellness"&gt;Mediterranean-style diet&lt;/a&gt; includes mostly vegetables, fruits, beans, nuts, lentils, whole grains and healthy fats, such as extra virgin olive oil and avocados. The diet may include a moderate amount of natural cheese and yogurt, but it is low in red meat and sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdor1ia1000n3b6nvcz66gdr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, the potential health benefits of participating in a food assistance program for an older adult who otherwise would be food-insecure are based on whether that adult uses the program to access &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ind.org%2Flearn&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjacqueline.howard%40cnn.com%7C5e077b540bda4a7a2eed08ddceac68c8%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638893962428270654%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=U2vvwHNTpeLhGIAWTHc7s7lATCrfIJpxqubCW6daRXw%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;brain healthy foods&lt;/a&gt; while taking other &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.retainyourbrain.com%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjacqueline.howard%40cnn.com%7C5e077b540bda4a7a2eed08ddceac68c8%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638893962428295407%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=gxhNmnVTd%2BFYNIUoM3W%2Blti%2F8aMDfyjqaL52YeXP%2Frg%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;steps to maintain cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;, said Isaacson, who established one of the first Alzheimer’s prevention clinics in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdor1ia1000o3b6n9dgtvy7x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You can’t eat a magic blueberry and think you’re going to prevent Alzheimer’s disease,” he said. “Healthy nutrition, exercising on a regular basis, seeing a doctor regularly to control blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, vascular risk factors – you need to do all of these different things to have the most benefit.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;(CNN) — &lt;/strong&gt;For summertime beachgoers, the threat of sharks may loom large, but nature’s deadliest predator is actually much smaller.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000q3b6my2gh1l5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The tiny mosquito is not only a warm-weather nuisance but also&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;wears the crown for “No. 1 killer of humanity across our existence,” according to historian Dr. Timothy C. Winegard. The predatory insect takes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128123652000032#bb0010" target="_blank"&gt;more than 1 million lives&lt;/a&gt; each year by transmitting lethal diseases. Sharks, meanwhile, are &lt;a href="https://www.ifaw.org/journal/faq-about-sharks#:~:text=How%20many%20people%20do%20sharks,each%20year%20by%20shark%20attacks." target="_blank"&gt;estimated to have a kill streak&lt;/a&gt; orders of magnitude smaller, at fewer than 10 people per year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000r3b6mnhw1z513@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Where humans go, mosquitoes have followed. Their itchy bites and the disease-causing pathogens they carry are infamous, and the insects are also responsible for driving many of humanity’s most essential turning points throughout history, said Winegard, author of “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mosquito-Human-History-Deadliest-Predator/dp/1524743429/" target="_blank"&gt;The Mosquito&lt;/a&gt;: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000s3b6mm65bd4ms@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/16/health/malaria-mosquito-control-scn"&gt;Malaria&lt;/a&gt; and yellow fever (have shaped) our historical journey from our hominid ancestral evolution … right to present day,” Winegard told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000t3b6mgw88ryqa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard, an associate professor of history at Colorado Mesa University, got the initial idea for his best-selling book from his dad’s interest in malaria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000u3b6mjgt62ptl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The wee pest didn’t intrigue Winegard too much at first. “I kind of disparaged him and said, ‘Sure, dad, I’ll write a book on mosquitoes,’” he recalled. But once Winegard began going down the rabbit hole of mosquito-borne pathogens’ impact on humanity — including, but not limited to malaria, Zika   virus, dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya and West Nile virus — he couldn’t stop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000v3b6mualqn6bb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The mosquito’s impact on history is still deeply felt in the present. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria" target="_blank"&gt;More than half a million&lt;/a&gt; people die of malaria alone each year, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/09/health/malaria-drug-babies-africa-intl"&gt;disease-heavy regions&lt;/a&gt; have suffered financially as a result. “Northern Hemisphere countries don’t have endemic malaria, (so) they’re able to develop more affluent economies because they’re not continuously suffering from malaria,” Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000w3b6mabla7tyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You can listen to the full episode &lt;a href="https://link.chtbl.com/c5RbATve" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cmdoxax4d00023b6m9esn16as@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000y3b6mdk03hdst@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Humans have been battling mosquitoes for millennia, and amid the season’s summer peak in the Northern Hemisphere, Winegard offered some insight into how you can keep them away this summer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000z3b6mpchtue5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Eighty-five percent of what makes you alluring or less alluring to mosquitoes is prewired in your genetic circuit board,” according to Winegard. However, there are a few ways you can manage mosquitoes. He has these five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800113b6m9joi46cz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Booze makes it easier for mosquitoes to see you, Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800123b6m9hkrd3eh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mosquitoes hunt by sight, but they don’t see the world like people do. The predatory insects employ thermal, or infrared, vision. “They see heat signatures,” Winegard noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800133b6mxcfsqcmn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Consuming alcohol raises your body temperature,” he explained over email, “which make(s) you an identifiable heat signature for your soon-to-be tormentor.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800143b6mfbihlute@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So, maybe reach for a refreshing glass of water or lemonade instead of that beer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800163b6mzucz63n1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to using heat-based vision, mosquitoes hunt down humans primarily through smell.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800173b6mjtwpp6sm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard said mosquitoes “can smell carbon dioxide from over 200 feet (60 meters) away.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800183b6mktk221ko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So if you’re exercising or breathing heavily, they’ll smell that and be attracted to it,” Winegard told Gupta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800193b6mu70yo1g6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And just like alcohol, high CO2 emissions make detecting heat signatures easier for mosquitoes, so Winegard recommends keeping yourself as cool as possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001a3b6msyx2estk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This applies to your wardrobe, too. “Dark clothes retain relatively more heat,” he said, so it’s best to opt for lighter-colored, long-sleeved attire to keep mosquitoes at bay.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001c3b6m930dnw0r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Applying insect repellent is the gold standard for mosquito management, but if you’re not careful when applying it, you can leave yourself vulnerable to bites.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001d3b6mu0ucva0s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I know people who lather themselves in it, but they miss this little spot on the back of their calf and she’ll find the chink in our armor,” Winegard told Gupta, referring to the female mosquito, who is the bloodsucking hunter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001e3b6mdz4y0hvt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mosquito repellent isn’t like perfume, in which a few spritzes can cover your whole body. If you’re spraying, make sure to be thorough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001f3b6ma8spo557@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “DEET (a chemical repellent) is still the gold standard, while oil of lemon eucalyptus is a plant-derived option,” Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001g3b6mgh9hynqd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For an added boost of security, he noted some clothes come pretreated with a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/prevention/about-permethrin-treated-clothing-and-gear.html#:~:text=clothing%20and%20gear-,Permethrin%20is%20an%20insecticide%20that%20kills%20or%20repels%20mosquitoes.,will%20help%20prevent%20mosquito%20bites." target="_blank"&gt;mosquito-targeted insecticide called permethrin&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001i3b6mf9tlgwbg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pool days and cool drinks outdoors offer a respite from the heat for humans, but they are equally as attractive to mosquitoes. Female mosquitoes lay their eggs in still water — and they don’t need much.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001j3b6mh38ewur3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “From a pond or stream to a minuscule collection in the bottom of an old container, used tire, or backyard toy — even a bottle cap full  — any will suffice,” Winegard said via email. Even waterlogged soil is enough for mom-to-be mosquitoes to lay their eggs in, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001k3b6muz2nunei@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard recommended eliminating standing water around your home and yard to keep potential mosquito breeding grounds to a minimum.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001m3b6mpuz3hmwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another way to fight the swarms this summer is to consider skipping a shower or two.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001n3b6m4rmsgp3f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s better to be stinky!” Winegard said. “Being pungently rancid is a good thing, for it increases bacterial levels on the skin, which makes you less alluring to mosquitoes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001o3b6mrefqgjor@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While this may offend others, Winegard says to skip the scented products: Deodorants, soaps and other applied fragrances are all enticing to mosquitoes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001p3b6m6m93jbap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The one exception is your feet. “Clean your feet,” he told Gupta. “The bacteria on our feet, which is the same one that ripens a lot of cheeses, is an aphrodisiac to mosquitoes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001q3b6mric5kpde@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard noted that this is the reason many of us get bitten around our ankles and feet. “So, wash your feet!” he urged.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001s3b6mif6clfzd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mosquitoes don’t care about most personal characteristics you can objectively see.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001t3b6man1zppc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is absolutely no truth to the persistent myths that mosquitoes fancy females over males, that they prefer blondes and redheads over those with darker hair, or that the darker or more leathery your skin, the safer you are from her bite,” Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001u3b6m2nxjyrlg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he noted that “she does play favorites and feasts on some more than others.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001v3b6my4n7focq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What might entice a mosquito? “Blood type O seems to be the vintage of choice over types A and B or their blend,” he said. “People with blood type O get bitten twice as often as those with type A, with type B falling somewhere in between.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001w3b6mflzzazk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The creators of the 1998 movie “A Bug’s Life,” he noted, must have “done their homework when portraying a tipsy mosquito ordering a ‘Bloody Mary, O-positive.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001x3b6m04z1fqg9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maybe it’s a mosquito’s world, Winegard suggests, and people are just living in it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;(CNN) — &lt;/strong&gt;For summertime beachgoers, the threat of sharks may loom large, but nature’s deadliest predator is actually much smaller.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000q3b6my2gh1l5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The tiny mosquito is not only a warm-weather nuisance but also&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;wears the crown for “No. 1 killer of humanity across our existence,” according to historian Dr. Timothy C. Winegard. The predatory insect takes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128123652000032#bb0010" target="_blank"&gt;more than 1 million lives&lt;/a&gt; each year by transmitting lethal diseases. Sharks, meanwhile, are &lt;a href="https://www.ifaw.org/journal/faq-about-sharks#:~:text=How%20many%20people%20do%20sharks,each%20year%20by%20shark%20attacks." target="_blank"&gt;estimated to have a kill streak&lt;/a&gt; orders of magnitude smaller, at fewer than 10 people per year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000r3b6mnhw1z513@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Where humans go, mosquitoes have followed. Their itchy bites and the disease-causing pathogens they carry are infamous, and the insects are also responsible for driving many of humanity’s most essential turning points throughout history, said Winegard, author of “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mosquito-Human-History-Deadliest-Predator/dp/1524743429/" target="_blank"&gt;The Mosquito&lt;/a&gt;: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000s3b6mm65bd4ms@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/16/health/malaria-mosquito-control-scn"&gt;Malaria&lt;/a&gt; and yellow fever (have shaped) our historical journey from our hominid ancestral evolution … right to present day,” Winegard told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000t3b6mgw88ryqa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard, an associate professor of history at Colorado Mesa University, got the initial idea for his best-selling book from his dad’s interest in malaria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000u3b6mjgt62ptl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The wee pest didn’t intrigue Winegard too much at first. “I kind of disparaged him and said, ‘Sure, dad, I’ll write a book on mosquitoes,’” he recalled. But once Winegard began going down the rabbit hole of mosquito-borne pathogens’ impact on humanity — including, but not limited to malaria, Zika   virus, dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya and West Nile virus — he couldn’t stop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000v3b6mualqn6bb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The mosquito’s impact on history is still deeply felt in the present. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria" target="_blank"&gt;More than half a million&lt;/a&gt; people die of malaria alone each year, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/09/health/malaria-drug-babies-africa-intl"&gt;disease-heavy regions&lt;/a&gt; have suffered financially as a result. “Northern Hemisphere countries don’t have endemic malaria, (so) they’re able to develop more affluent economies because they’re not continuously suffering from malaria,” Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000w3b6mabla7tyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            Humans have been battling mosquitoes for millennia, and amid the season’s summer peak in the Northern Hemisphere, Winegard offered some insight into how you can keep them away this summer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8000z3b6mpchtue5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Eighty-five percent of what makes you alluring or less alluring to mosquitoes is prewired in your genetic circuit board,” according to Winegard. However, there are a few ways you can manage mosquitoes. He has these five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800113b6m9joi46cz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Booze makes it easier for mosquitoes to see you, Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800123b6m9hkrd3eh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mosquitoes hunt by sight, but they don’t see the world like people do. The predatory insects employ thermal, or infrared, vision. “They see heat signatures,” Winegard noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800133b6mxcfsqcmn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Consuming alcohol raises your body temperature,” he explained over email, “which make(s) you an identifiable heat signature for your soon-to-be tormentor.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800143b6mfbihlute@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So, maybe reach for a refreshing glass of water or lemonade instead of that beer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800163b6mzucz63n1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to using heat-based vision, mosquitoes hunt down humans primarily through smell.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800173b6mjtwpp6sm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard said mosquitoes “can smell carbon dioxide from over 200 feet (60 meters) away.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800183b6mktk221ko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So if you’re exercising or breathing heavily, they’ll smell that and be attracted to it,” Winegard told Gupta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd800193b6mu70yo1g6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And just like alcohol, high CO2 emissions make detecting heat signatures easier for mosquitoes, so Winegard recommends keeping yourself as cool as possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001a3b6msyx2estk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This applies to your wardrobe, too. “Dark clothes retain relatively more heat,” he said, so it’s best to opt for lighter-colored, long-sleeved attire to keep mosquitoes at bay.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001c3b6m930dnw0r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Applying insect repellent is the gold standard for mosquito management, but if you’re not careful when applying it, you can leave yourself vulnerable to bites.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001d3b6mu0ucva0s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I know people who lather themselves in it, but they miss this little spot on the back of their calf and she’ll find the chink in our armor,” Winegard told Gupta, referring to the female mosquito, who is the bloodsucking hunter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001e3b6mdz4y0hvt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mosquito repellent isn’t like perfume, in which a few spritzes can cover your whole body. If you’re spraying, make sure to be thorough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001f3b6ma8spo557@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “DEET (a chemical repellent) is still the gold standard, while oil of lemon eucalyptus is a plant-derived option,” Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001g3b6mgh9hynqd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For an added boost of security, he noted some clothes come pretreated with a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/prevention/about-permethrin-treated-clothing-and-gear.html#:~:text=clothing%20and%20gear-,Permethrin%20is%20an%20insecticide%20that%20kills%20or%20repels%20mosquitoes.,will%20help%20prevent%20mosquito%20bites." target="_blank"&gt;mosquito-targeted insecticide called permethrin&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001i3b6mf9tlgwbg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pool days and cool drinks outdoors offer a respite from the heat for humans, but they are equally as attractive to mosquitoes. Female mosquitoes lay their eggs in still water — and they don’t need much.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001j3b6mh38ewur3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “From a pond or stream to a minuscule collection in the bottom of an old container, used tire, or backyard toy — even a bottle cap full  — any will suffice,” Winegard said via email. Even waterlogged soil is enough for mom-to-be mosquitoes to lay their eggs in, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001k3b6muz2nunei@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard recommended eliminating standing water around your home and yard to keep potential mosquito breeding grounds to a minimum.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001m3b6mpuz3hmwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another way to fight the swarms this summer is to consider skipping a shower or two.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001n3b6m4rmsgp3f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s better to be stinky!” Winegard said. “Being pungently rancid is a good thing, for it increases bacterial levels on the skin, which makes you less alluring to mosquitoes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001o3b6mrefqgjor@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While this may offend others, Winegard says to skip the scented products: Deodorants, soaps and other applied fragrances are all enticing to mosquitoes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001p3b6m6m93jbap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The one exception is your feet. “Clean your feet,” he told Gupta. “The bacteria on our feet, which is the same one that ripens a lot of cheeses, is an aphrodisiac to mosquitoes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001q3b6mric5kpde@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Winegard noted that this is the reason many of us get bitten around our ankles and feet. “So, wash your feet!” he urged.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001s3b6mif6clfzd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mosquitoes don’t care about most personal characteristics you can objectively see.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001t3b6man1zppc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is absolutely no truth to the persistent myths that mosquitoes fancy females over males, that they prefer blondes and redheads over those with darker hair, or that the darker or more leathery your skin, the safer you are from her bite,” Winegard said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001u3b6m2nxjyrlg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he noted that “she does play favorites and feasts on some more than others.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001v3b6my4n7focq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What might entice a mosquito? “Blood type O seems to be the vintage of choice over types A and B or their blend,” he said. “People with blood type O get bitten twice as often as those with type A, with type B falling somewhere in between.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001w3b6mflzzazk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The creators of the 1998 movie “A Bug’s Life,” he noted, must have “done their homework when portraying a tipsy mosquito ordering a ‘Bloody Mary, O-positive.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdovhzd8001x3b6m04z1fqg9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maybe it’s a mosquito’s world, Winegard suggests, and people are just living in it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Body fat percentage and body fat mass aren’t the same thing, so if your goal is to lose fat and look more sculpted or defined, you’ll need to know the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a personal trainer, I’ve spent years helping clients build muscle and strength while losing fat — it’s a process called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/can-you-lose-fat-and-build-muscle-at-the-same-time-heres-the-scoop-on-body-recomposition" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/can-you-lose-fat-and-build-muscle-at-the-same-time-heres-the-scoop-on-body-recomposition"&gt;body recomposition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a bit like the Holy Grail of fitness goals. But when it comes to the fat loss part, I’m surprised by how many people aren’t aware of their body fat percentage and their mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently caught up with some experts who shared their insight into fat mass and fat percentage, the difference and why &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; matter if your goal is to hone your physique.

This percentage is often used as a measure of overall body composition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-s-the-difference"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What's the difference?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-person-5grDWpRFDhmcJqcwVQxXYE-guP70jYGdaj6y19WdrsvYFfTQy7TkJak" class="slice-container person-wrapper person-5grDWpRFDhmcJqcwVQxXYE-guP70jYGdaj6y19WdrsvYFfTQy7TkJak slice-container-person"&gt;&lt;div class="person person--separator"&gt;&lt;div class="person__heading"&gt;&lt;p class="person__name-socials"&gt;&lt;span class="person__name"&gt;Daniel Herman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="person__role"&gt;SAQ coach and NASM PT and nutritionist &lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="person__bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Herman is a SAQ coach and NASM-qualified personal trainer and nutritionist with 28 years’ experience in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cheema says that while body fat mass refers to the actual &lt;em&gt;weight&lt;/em&gt; of fat in your body, body fat percentage represents &lt;em&gt;how much &lt;/em&gt;of your total weight is fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For instance, someone who weighs 180 pounds and has 15% body fat has a lower fat percentage than someone who weighs 180 pounds with 30% body fat, even though both individuals have the same body fat mass,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1584493&amp;amp;xcust=tomsguide_us_1555238858843435878&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bio-synergy.uk&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tomsguide.com%2Fwellness%2Ffitness%2Fbody-fat-percentage-vs-body-fat-mass-experts-say-this-is-what-you-need-to-know-to-lose-fat" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener" data-url="http://www.bio-synergy.uk" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1584493&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bio-synergy.uk&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tomsguide.com%2Fwellness%2Ffitness%2Fbody-fat-percentage-vs-body-fat-mass-experts-say-this-is-what-you-need-to-know-to-lose-fat" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="bio-synergy.uk" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;Daniel Herman,&lt;/a&gt; NASM nutritionist and SAQ coach, adds that body fat mass is made up of essential fat needed for vital functions like hormone regulation and organ protection, and storage fat, which is an excess that your body keeps for energy reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explains body fat percentage slightly differently: “If you weigh 80kg and have 20kg of fat, your body fat percentage is 25%. But if you gain 5kg of muscle while maintaining 20kg of fat, your percentage will decrease because the fat makes up a smaller proportion of your total weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Body fat mass tells you how much fat you've lost. Body fat percentage shows whether you’re becoming leaner — even if your weight doesn’t change,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="pros-of-reducing-body-fat-mass-3"&gt;Pros of reducing body fat mass&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By reducing your overall body fat mass, you can improve various health markers, such as reducing the risk of chronic health conditions like heart disease and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cheema says lower body fat mass can improve physical performance and lead to better muscle definition, increased strength and higher endurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, there’s the day-to-day, which includes better mobility and reduced strain on your joints, which can improve pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="pros-of-reducing-body-fat-percentage-3"&gt;Pros of reducing body fat percentage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on reducing body fat percentage primarily improves body composition, resulting in a leaner, more toned appearance. In short, you build or maintain muscle mass while losing fat. Win-Win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can lead to improvements in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/hands-on/i-tested-the-levels-continuous-glucose-monitor-to-track-my-metabolism-heres-what-happened" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/hands-on/i-tested-the-levels-continuous-glucose-monitor-to-track-my-metabolism-heres-what-happened"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;, better insulin sensitivity and a more aesthetic physique,” says Dr. Cheema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For athletes or individuals focused on strength training, reducing body fat percentage improves muscle-to-fat ratio, optimizing performance.” Because lean muscle is more metabolically active, you may find your resting metabolic rate also improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When lean muscle mass increases and fat comes down, this can have a positive impact on &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/functional-strength-and-mobility-expert-shares-5-minute-routine-to-boost-flexibility-heres-why-im-sticking-with-it" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/functional-strength-and-mobility-expert-shares-5-minute-routine-to-boost-flexibility-heres-why-im-sticking-with-it"&gt;functional strength&lt;/a&gt; and bone health, not just energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is particularly important as you age and bone and muscle strength begin to decline. Plus, you should feel generally healthier and more able to carry out daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-which-is-better-to-focus-on"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Which is better to focus on?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Cheema, it’s better to focus on reducing body fat percentage, “as this not only enhances physical appearance but also signifies improvements in muscle mass and overall fitness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, body fat mass is important, but Dr. Cheema says tracking body fat percentage is what gives a “clearer picture of your health and physical progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, if you need to reduce a number of kilos for medical reasons, this should be the priority to begin with. You can focus on the rest later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to reduce both, Dr. Cheema recommends combining cardio with strength training and a balanced diet. Think &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/how-much-protein-do-you-need-to-build-muscle" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/how-much-protein-do-you-need-to-build-muscle"&gt;high protein&lt;/a&gt; and calorie-controlled (here’s &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/i-dont-recommend-counting-calories-heres-why" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/i-dont-recommend-counting-calories-heres-why"&gt;why I don’t recommend counting calories&lt;/a&gt;, but for a short time, sure).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This should help you reduce fat and build muscle at the same time, plus cardio exercises like running or cycling can help raise your heart rate, step count and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories"&gt;energy expenditure&lt;/a&gt;. Getting about and completing more steps also improves energy burn outside of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If your primary concern is health, focus on reducing body fat mass. If your goal is to look leaner or improve athletic performance, aim to reduce body fat percentage by maintaining or gaining muscle while losing fat,” recommends Herman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herman agrees that there are a few steps to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrition: &lt;/strong&gt;Eat in a caloric deficit to promote fat loss, prioritizing high amounts of protein, roughly 1.5-2 grams of protein per kg of bodyweight. Of course, balance is key, but during a deficit, it is better to steer clear of excessive sugar and alcohol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength training: &lt;/strong&gt;Resistance training anywhere from two to five sessions per week, depending on your goals and lifestyle. Herman says to include &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/im-a-personal-trainer-these-are-the-5-compound-exercises-i-taught-my-dad-to-build-strength-and-muscle" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/im-a-personal-trainer-these-are-the-5-compound-exercises-i-taught-my-dad-to-build-strength-and-muscle"&gt;compound exercises&lt;/a&gt; like squats, deadlifts and push-ups, which I agree with wholeheartedly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardio: &lt;/strong&gt;“Walking is underrated — daily steps matter,” says Herman. Moderate-intensity cardio or HIIT are great options, but if you don’t enjoy cardio, just focus on your steps. Here’s the &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/forget-10-000-steps-study-reveals-the-real-number-of-minimum-daily-steps-you-should-take-according-to-your-age" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/forget-10-000-steps-study-reveals-the-real-number-of-minimum-daily-steps-you-should-take-according-to-your-age"&gt;real minimum number of steps you should take daily.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle:&lt;/strong&gt; Herman recommends between seven and nine hours of quality sleep. Stress can elevate cortisol levels and contribute to fat storage, so managing this and keeping energy high is important. Plus, always stay hydrated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide on Google News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get our up-to-date news, how-tos, and reviews in your feeds.

This dog owner shared her plans for a bucket list to enjoy every single moment with her &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/advocacy/102552-three-reasons-you-need-a-rescue-dog" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rescue dog;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;rescue dog&lt;/a&gt;, who suffers from “incurable” cancer, in a tear-jerking video. In the emotional post, the owner, Abby, could barely hold back her tears as she announced how Harvey changed her life, as they look forward to cherishing their time together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Owner makes a bucket list after dog is diagnosed with cancer in video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Every &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/video-dogs-t-stop-tail-080923014.html" data-ylk="slk:tail wag;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;tail wag&lt;/a&gt;, excited bark, and cuddle will remind you how much your four-legged companion deserves the best things in life. A moving Instagram video documented a pet owner’s bucket list for her rescue dog after his cancer diagnosis so they can make the most of the remaining moments together. Abby talked about the heartache and difficulties they have faced as they navigate through Harvey’s life-changing diagnosis, but now they want to focus on a path that brings they joy and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the clip, the dog mom claimed that she didn’t intend for the bucket list to focus on the rescue’s cancer. Instead, she made it about enjoying “every single moment that we have together.” Abby then recalled the day she brought Harvey home eight years ago and remembered a thought about doing “all these things together,” but they have yet to experience so much. That said, she disclosed the first thing on the list — making him a gourmet meal because the key to his happiness has always been through his stomach with food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video showed the pet owner checking off the first item on the bucket list for her cancer-stricken rescue dog. She cooked him a gourmet meal, comprising delicious salmon, steak, brown rice, and carrots that he so rightfully deserved for always being a good boy. After devouring the fancy meal, Harvey seemingly walked “around wagging his tail for at least an hour.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Abby has since shared a few more videos, capturing the moments she and the rescue dog ticked off two other items off the bucket list. A &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DL0Rv9QxB6p/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=Nm4wNmEyY3V1anVr" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:follow-up video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;follow-up video&lt;/a&gt; showed that the second one was spending a weekend at his grandma’s house.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For nearly three decades, Mayo Clinic researcher Christopher Evans, Ph.D., has pushed to expand gene therapy beyond its original scope of fixing rare, single-gene defects. That has meant systematically advancing the field through laboratory experiments, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Several gene therapies have already received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and experts predict that 40 to 60 more could be approved over the next decade for a range of conditions. Dr. Evans hopes a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gene+therapy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/osteoarthritis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;—a form of arthritis affecting more than 32.5 million U.S. adults—will be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Dr. Evans and a team of 18 researchers and clinicians reported the results of a first-in-human, Phase I clinical trial of a novel gene therapy for osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adu9804" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, demonstrate that the therapy is safe, achieved sustained expression of a therapeutic gene inside the joint and offered early evidence of clinical benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This could revolutionize the treatment of osteoarthritis," says Dr. Evans, who directs the Musculoskeletal Gene Therapy Research lab at Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In osteoarthritis, the cartilage that cushions the ends of bones—and sometimes the underlying bone itself—degenerates over time. It is a leading cause of disability, and notoriously difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Any medications you inject into the affected joint will seep right back out in a few hours," says Dr. Evans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As far as I know, gene therapy is the only reasonable way to overcome this pharmacologic barrier, and it's a huge barrier." By genetically modifying cells in the joint to produce their own pharmacy of anti-inflammatory molecules, Evans aims to engineer knees that are more resistant to arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The Evans laboratory found that a molecule called interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays an important role in fueling inflammation, pain and cartilage loss in osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it, the molecule had a natural inhibitor, aptly named the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), that could form the basis of the first gene therapy for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, Dr. Evans and his team packaged the IL-1Ra gene into a harmless virus called AAV, which they tested in cells and then pre-clinical models. The results were encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pre-clinical testing, his collaborators at the University of Florida demonstrated that the gene therapy successfully infiltrated the cells that make up the synovial lining of the joint as well as the neighboring cartilage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapy protected the cartilage from breakdown. In 2015, the team got investigational new drug approval to start human testing. But regulatory hurdles and manufacturing challenges kept them from injecting their first patient for another four years. Mayo Clinic has since established a new process for accelerating clinical trial activation that could help researchers launch studies more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the recent study, Dr. Evans and his team gave the experimental gene therapy to nine patients with osteoarthritis, delivering it directly into the knee joint. They found that the levels of the anti-inflammatory IL-1Ra increased and remained elevated in the joint for at least a year. Participants also reported reduced pain and improved joint function, with no serious safety issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Evans says the findings suggest the treatment is safe and may offer long-lasting relief from osteoarthritis symptoms. "This study provides a highly promising, novel way to attack the disease," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Evans has co-founded an arthritis gene therapy company called Genascence to drive the project forward. The company has completed a larger Phase Ib study and is in discussions with the FDA about launching a pivotal Phase IIb/III clinical trial to evaluate the therapy's effectiveness, the next step before FDA approval of the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

rabies exposure case for the year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, officials with the Person County Animal
Services and Person County Health Department said a bat on Rolling Hills Road resulted
in two confirmed rabies exposures. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;People are urged to take extra precautions when
approaching wild animals or animals they are unfamiliar with. Officials also
said people should: &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor your surroundings when outdoors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep children and pets supervised and away from wildlife &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure all pets are up to date on rabies vaccinations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid handling stray or injured animals, even seemingly friendly animals &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Officials say anyone that may have been bitten or
scratched by an animal, or if a pet encounters a wild animal should call 911
and seek emergency medical care immediately. &lt;/p&gt;

As the study notes, “it remains unclear whether these brain aging effects may be at least partially reversible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious-disease expert who wasn’t affiliated with the study, said its findings demonstrate “that even if you don’t get infected, all the repercussions of the pandemic — like social isolation and stress — can have an impact on brain health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that other things that we do have an impact on brain health, like exercise and diet and sleep,” Chin-Hong said. “So it makes sense that something as global and as profound as a pandemic would have an impact on brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those effects don’t necessarily include immediate decreased cognitive function, however. Although researchers documented accelerated aging in generally all the brain scans they studied, only those who contracted COVID-19 showed “small but measurable declines in cognitive performance — mainly in processing speed and mental flexibility,” according to Mohammadi-Nejad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that infection may introduce additional biological effects, such as inflammation or vascular issues, that are more directly linked to cognitive symptoms,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past studies &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-21/covid-19-might-shrink-parts-brain-scientists-warn"&gt;have noted cognitive effects&lt;/a&gt; after COVID-19 illness, especially in severe cases, he said. But what’s new is that evidence of cognitive decline was found even in this study’s population “of generally healthy volunteers, most of whom had mild cases.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It shows that even mild infection can leave subtle traces in the brain, although the effect size is relatively small,” Mohammadi-Nejad said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect was especially pronounced among older people, the study found, “suggesting a complex model of cognitive decline due to more pronounced accelerated brain aging from infection-related factors in older people.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was based on an analysis of brain scans from the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-our-data/our-participants/" target="_blank"&gt;UK Biobank,&lt;/a&gt; a large biomedical database in the United Kingdom that contains health information from volunteers taken both before and after the onset of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on a group of 996 participants and compared brain scans taken before and after the pandemic began. The group comprised primarily  middle-aged and older people, ranging in age from 47 to 79. Only those who were generally healthy were included in the study, meaning they didn’t have chronic illness such as heart disease, diabetes, dementia, kidney disease or major depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this group, scientists found the accelerated brain aging was seen more strongly overall in older people and men. People who were socioeconomically disadvantaged — ranking lower on indicators such as income, education, employment and health access — also had more pronounced brain aging, Mohammadi-Nejad said, “likely due to increased exposure to pandemic-related stress &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-02/alarming-disparities-leave-parts-of-l-a-hard-bit-by-covid"&gt;and fewer resources to&lt;/a&gt; buffer its effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first study to suggest brain health was altered by the experience of living through the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2403200121" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last year in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, by scientists at the University of Washington, suggested that COVID-19 lockdown measures “resulted in unusually accelerated brain maturation in adolescents” and was greater in magnitude in females than males. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of that study noted that “females are at a higher risk for developing anxiety and mood disorders than males during typical adolescent development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But among adults, past research has suggested “men may be more susceptible to certain forms of brain aging,” Mohammadi-Nejad said. Other research, the study noted, has found “greater male susceptibility to cortical atrophy and neuroinflammation under stress, which aligns with our findings of heightened pandemic-related brain aging in males.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of limitations to the study. The people participating in the study who had COVID-19 had mostly mild cases — and they were generally healthier than the population overall, since those with chronic illnesses were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among study participants who contracted COVID-19, fewer than 4% required hospitalization. The vast majority had mild illness; and all participants tested negative for COVID-19 within two to three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other factors also could contribute to the documented brain aging, including “reduced physical activity, poorer diets and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-08/alcohol-abuse-pandemic-hospitals-liver-disease"&gt;increased alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;” during the pandemic, the study said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many unanswered questions remain. If further studies do prove the pandemic-related factors caused accelerated brain aging, rather than  simply being associated with it, how long will those effects last? And, “once you have it, can you do anything to make it better?” Chin-Hong asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study doesn’t answer the question of whether the accelerated brain aging is reversible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is well known that there are things that are good for general brain health, Mohammadi-Nejad said: physical activity, mental stimulation, social interaction, healthy sleep and good nutrition among them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public policies that reduce social isolation and ensure continued access to physical, cognitive, and emotional well-being during major disruptions could help mitigate future effects on brain health,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, the study may raise the question of whether the pandemic-era response &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-10-12/report-uk-slow-coronavirus-lockdown-thousands-died"&gt;measures employed in Britain&lt;/a&gt; were worth the cost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But answering that question today — &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-28/do-not-post-californias-covid-emergency-is-over-now-what"&gt;years after COVID ceased&lt;/a&gt; to be a novel public health threat — is complicated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study wasn’t designed to evaluate public health policies or determine what should or shouldn’t have been done. What we show is that the pandemic experience, independent of infection, was associated with changes in brain health,” Mohammadi-Nejad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 today is very different than the dark early period of the pandemic, when the disease devastated many families, prematurely killing &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-11-23/covid-19-struck-at-the-heart-of-latino-family-networks"&gt;grandparents &lt;/a&gt;and leaving children to grow up without their &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-12-09/young-latinos-death-covid-high-rates-california"&gt;dad&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-12/inland-empire-parents-of-5-children-die-of-coronavirus-weeks-apart"&gt;mom&lt;/a&gt;. The death rate was much higher in the initial phase of the emergency, with hospitals in some areas &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-11/los-angeles-coronavirus-hospitals-ambulances-horror"&gt;overwhelmed with&lt;/a&gt; staggering numbers of critically ill people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-02/how-common-is-long-covid-a-new-study-provides-fresh-clues"&gt;getting long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, and suffering debilitating symptoms such as brain fog or persistent fatigue, was also once much higher than it is today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in the pandemic, “it was a more serious time for COVID,” Chin-Hong said. “It was a time when you didn’t want to get infected at all.... Like, who would want to get Alpha or &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-24/covid-19-delta-variant-spread-california-how-bad-is-it"&gt;Delta&lt;/a&gt;, you know?” he added, referring to the variants that preceded Omicron. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s version of COVID is “less invasive — even independent of the fact that we have more immunity,” Chin-Hong said. The latest subvariants of the coronavirus don’t “get inside the body as much as the earlier variants.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong said he’s glad there was a time early in the pandemic where “we tried to avoid COVID as much as possible,” noting that infection itself has a chance of affecting the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s also clear that health issues such loneliness have a clear effect on brain health. Dr. Vivek Murthy, the former U.S. surgeon general, issued an advisory on what he called a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-05-02/loneliness-isolation-epidemic-u-s-surgeon-general-declares"&gt;national epidemic of loneliness and isolation&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, and warned that loneliness is associated with a greater risk of dementia, depression, anxiety and premature death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of U.S. adults experienced loneliness even before the pandemic, according to Murthy’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, which urged the public to fight loneliness and isolation by taking steps to strengthen their relationships. The British government in 2018 found loneliness to be such a public health concern that it created a new position: minister of loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest study underscores the idea that things such as exercise, sleep, diet, social connection and stress reduction are important for our brain health, according to Chin-Hong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resolving stress and a lack of social connection “is probably as important as ... focusing on things like blood pressure and the things we traditionally think about,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxQZ3h0U2RMMDdwNlV2ZF9YT1JFM0NZVWR4d1lSckNnQWV4Qk1ua1F5UDV0RWRWWVFpSUZvOS1kZG93Rl96OXVIT0lMaEdlMVJJck5MeS1CTjFSU09VbGc5RjdTWXdBMldrdVotS2tEZVB3UVlucHZOUWNTeE9iSTg4VVVOM3A4NDhOQUs1REJHcmlhZEJiTVFZTXZvQXRfTjRhMXZGQ1c5WTZYaXlxRXR1M0t2TG5xRXBuQ3dRRC1jOA</guid></item><item><title>从流行音乐之旅到寄生虫治疗：认识亚特兰大的虱子女士- AJC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOeTJCelZ6dFhBcGZ5Z3BoWEpQb1ZsSGdaX2FEa1F4akRhdFhfaHpsM2s0NnZOMUR1ZUJ0ZUxneS1GYzJPdl80QXF6NFBNSk1kZmRJUU5oVGdVcGNTbGFRbHlVczV1ajJFSG1nbGZFdGh5ZnREa05aN0FmUkZodk9YT1RvN2NoOGFwSGlqUnlrbE82Zm0taDNoeUtZZWFRLW03UlZzWmtrR1ZNeDV1?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-contentElements" data-start-index="5"&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="6"&gt;â€œI was writing a continuing education course about all species of lice for extra money, and I read about companies like this, and I thought it sounded fun and interesting,â€� said Lasater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="7"&gt;She started out as a mobile business and opened her first location in Alpharetta in 2010. Word spread like lice at a sleepover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-component  b-margin-bottom-d40-m20  image-landscape" data-index="9"&gt;&lt;div class="image-component-image inline "&gt;&lt;div class="enlargeImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: abbey.cutrer@ajc.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="[object%20Object]" class="image-expand" alt="icon to expand image"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: abbey.cutrer@ajc.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="story-subscription__placeholder subscription-promo b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="11"&gt;â€œIt was getting to be overwhelming because we got busy,â€� she said. â€œSo, I called Molly, whoâ€™s been my best friend now for over 30 years.â€�&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-nativo_placeholder--moap b-clear-both "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="13"&gt;Lasater met Molly Brandenberger when they were in Intrygue together, and they quickly became close friends. Brandenberger had studied public relations in school and went on to work in event planning before Lasater called her for reinforcement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="14"&gt;â€œWe had survived the music industry together, and I said, â€˜Hey dude, do you want to come pick some lice with me?â€™â€� Lasater recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="15"&gt;â€œAnd I said, â€˜Sure, dude, itâ€™s got to be better than corporate America,â€™â€� said Brandenberger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="16"&gt;Brandenberger became a co-owner, and together, theyâ€™ve grown the Lice Ladies from one clinic to five in the metro Atlanta area as well as franchises in Woodstock, Athens and Dallas, Texas. The offices are considered medical clinics because theyâ€™re focused on treatment, which ranges in cost from $90 to $195, depending on how severe the case is. They also offer head checks for $20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-component  b-margin-bottom-d40-m20  image-landscape" data-index="17"&gt;&lt;div class="image-component-image inline "&gt;&lt;div class="enlargeImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: abbey.cutrer@ajc.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="[object%20Object]" class="image-expand" alt="icon to expand image"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: abbey.cutrer@ajc.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="MP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="RP09 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="20"&gt;Killing lice is nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="21"&gt;â€œTheyâ€™ve been spreading from head-to-head for thousands and thousands of years, and theyâ€™ve had all this time to build up a resistance to pesticides,â€� said Lasater. The best way to get rid of them is the old-fashioned way â€” through removal with a lice comb, which has closely spaced teeth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="22"&gt;Myths around lice abound. While theyâ€™re associated with filth and poor hygiene, the reality is that lice love all human hair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="23"&gt;â€œIt does not care. You literally have to be Mr. Clean-on-the-bottle bald to not be able to get it,â€� said Lasater. â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter what hair type you have, what texture hair you have, anyone and everyone can get head lice.â€� This includes Black hair, too, which is often believed to be immune to lice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="24"&gt;When Lice Ladies first opened, Lasater used traditional lice-removing products but was quickly turned off by their odors. â€œI could smell that they were (mixed) with vinegar, and I didnâ€™t like them,â€� she said. â€œI felt like the patients smelled like mustard.â€� &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="PX01 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="26"&gt;So, she got to work on concocting her own product line while working at her clinics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="27"&gt;â€œI figured out the enzyme combo and had several different versions made of it,â€� said Lasater. The enzyme doesnâ€™t kill the lice but breaks down their skeletons and loosens them from the hair. Later, she added peppermint oil to the formula to cool off her patientsâ€™ heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="28"&gt;When patients visit Lice Ladies, theyâ€™re taken into private rooms equipped with televisions, which are essential for distracting the younger patients. Then their hair is dampened and coated in the enzyme product before itâ€™s sectioned off and combed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-component  b-margin-bottom-d40-m20  image-landscape" data-index="30"&gt;&lt;div class="image-component-image inline "&gt;&lt;div class="enlargeImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: abbey.cutrer@ajc.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="[object%20Object]" class="image-expand" alt="icon to expand image"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: abbey.cutrer@ajc.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="31"&gt;â€œThe females lay the nits on the hair, but they can lay a nit anywhere around a hair, so it doesnâ€™t have to be on top. It can be on the side of the hair, on the bottom,â€� said Lasater. â€œSo, we comb in multiple directions, kind of gently scraping the comb against the scalp, and then the little grooves in the comb actually drag the nits out of the hair.â€� &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="33"&gt;Education and destigmatization are just as important as treatment to the Lice Ladies, which is why their work reaches beyond the clinics. Their summers are spent visiting sleepaway camps for lice checks and removal, while the school year takes them into some of Atlantaâ€™s private schools. They also have a podcast with their friend and producer, Kara Kurcz, called â€œOh Gross!â€�&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="34"&gt;â€œKara always had this vision to talk about things that have sort of a stigma attached to them, like lice and other things, and build a community where people arenâ€™t afraid to talk about the gross or the things that have a stigma attached,â€� said Lasater. They are also active &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theliceladies" target="_blank"&gt;on TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, where they share peeks at patientsâ€™ scalps (with permission, of course).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="35"&gt;At the end of the day, the Lice Ladies remind parents that lice happen and itâ€™s nothing to freak out about. â€œThis is normal, this is something that happens to everyone,â€� says Brandenberger. â€œIf your kids have clean hair, they like you.

I couldn't be the mother I wanted for my three children,' she admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amanda Wolaver (pictured), 33, from Georgia, thought she was 'slowly dying' after she went for her Botox top-up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother of Landen, 16, Braxton, 11, and Havyn, five, said she was unable to walk, move or drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the end, she had to fork out more than £22,000 in March 2025 on tests for an MRI to confirm she had experienced TIA strokes - temporary disruptions of blood flow to the brain - and was suffering from iatrogenic botulism, a rare condition where toxins attack the nervous system and cause paralysis, according to the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was caused by botulinum neurotoxins, which are the active ingredient in the neurotoxins Botox and Dysport, which the mother had been injected with for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dysport is an anti-ageing compound with the same ingredients as Botox, but is said to have longer-lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That knocked me back,' the mother said, 'to be told I had suffered from multiple small strokes in my brain made me think that this would eventually kill me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years on, she still is not fully recovered and is waiting for time to detoxify her body, as there is no specific treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Wolaver changed her diet completely to manage her symptoms, cutting out caffeine and soda, as well as having her breast implants removed to let her body detoxify fully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She hopes that by sharing her story, she highlights the risks so that the same thing will not happen to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The mother-of-three went for her routine anti-wrinkle injection in her face to smooth out her crow's feet, eleven lines and forehead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Wolaver spent over £22,000 on tests for an MRI (pictured) to confirm she had experienced TIA strokes and was suffering from iatrogenic botulism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amanda said that she became reliant on her husband Josh due to her symptoms (pictured with Josh and their daughter Havyn)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The mother went on to have spinal tap surgeries and had a heart monitor implanted to find the cause, with doctors initially suspecting MS or an autoimmune disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was, after all, her sleuthing in the Botox forum that led her to stumble on botulinum neurotoxins and directed her to ask her doctor for the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I learned the cost of beauty the hard way,' she said, and admitted she had finally embraced her wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes after&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-14947515/Woman-reveals-REALLY-happens-you-lip-filler-dissolved.html?ico=authors_pagination_desktop"&gt; a woman revealed insight into the process of having lip filler dissolved&lt;/a&gt; - and admitted that she was left looking 'botched'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Georgia Goldstein travelled to Hart Medical in Westminster, London, a few months ago to undergo the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she said that it was 'the best thing I've ever done', the process wasn't pain-free and left her lips looking swollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taking to TikTok, she said, 'A few months ago, I got all my lip filler dissolved, and it was the best thing I've ever done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went on to share images from throughout the process, adding, 'Trigger warning, my face looked butters [ugly].'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Georgia explained that, when the aesthetician put the dissolver in her lips, they swelled drastically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amanda started experiencing 'severe' headaches within 24 hours of receiving her Botox treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Two years on, she still is not fully recovered and is waiting for time to detoxify her body as there is no specific treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Like, imagine, I have to go into work right now and they [her lips] look botched,' she said while showing her bloated lips to the camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continued to show photographs from throughout the process, saying, 'This was pretty much just after going into work and this was the next day, my lips were black, like you can see in this video, they were so, so bruised.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Georgia added, 'I even tried covering them up with makeup, and it was just all black above my lips.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The content creator said her lips then 'shrunk', making her feel 'really young', she said, adding, 'And they also went really wrinkly.' One week later, the bruising had gone, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the process, Georgia went for an ultrasound to check if there was any filler left in her lips, before concluding that getting her fillers dissolved was the 'best thing ever.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Viewers took to the comment section to share their thoughts on the end result, and one wrote, 'Great more natural result, love.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A second added, 'Trust the process hun.' While a third user said, 'Look so much better. Love them!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A fourth commented on Georgia going into work immediately after getting them dissolved, saying 'Honestly the bravery going into work.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox femail" data-version="2" id="mol-9b5be990-6c9e-11f0-afdc-4d6dd72cda91" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14950629/paralysed-strokes-botox-face.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;What is a botulism?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Botulism is a rare but serious condition, which caused by a toxin that attacks the body's nerves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Botulism can cause life-threatening symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms can include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Facial weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Drooping eyelids &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blurred or double vision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Paralysis &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Trouble breathing &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Source - Mayo Clinic&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 09:43:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOcndBZVlxV3MySGEteFE3SXhGY0dLOERBVEJPMHc5cFJfdUFlaGlKX0xaeUQ1VUJ5WlRuZXUxWG1EUEd0QmsxU3VyWXJDNFEzdl96YnVUd21POHhCZXA0bDcyZkNnZFNMVmN4SjZYclcxNXlEbHpFZzc1VEJ1bXdhUW4yQTJYRDZSWkFhMU9B0gGTAUFVX3lxTE5Ec3ZNV094Zm5zZGhfSHJsMUhzeTVXdkMzYkUyR1RZc0xlYjBVRzMyTHc5ZzVGTjdmOVRmVndzMjJQeUE2X3I2QlJNdlM4bmlDUTNqTEU3MUFmNUMzQVExU3VaN1ZueWJjZXo1LVBGd3RkdTY4bEJsbEluNmQ4SHItXzZZbEd4alM4Q0xyWmxrY2xMQQ</guid></item><item><title>“Ozempic face”可能正在推动整容手术热潮- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE5NQkRLd3lBNjZjb3RrY2I4dDZZNEVsaHJkSWs4Mjk5N3g1d0RBY3FDLXZ4NjE5ajZJN1hQMllSY0FVNklEVlJ6eGxwNVZSWTYtdTJkZDJ1M2ZUbFdOUWZleVgwbFlsclF1VTRmU0w1RWx2dURB0gF6QVVfeXFMT3VpdDhHR0pweTRGN29kRXZFVWxGQTV0Nkg3QVoyMGRBWDFtdVVaZDNIMUl0Tk1KQ3AzWWk3czFKb2NONHJjNkRlLVp2cFpubzFSY2dXQmtPbGQ1RVdMMFJ6ZGtsQnRvWVNhcTh0SmpjY1BMUGZIb3B1Q0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            About two years ago, celebrity cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Paul Jarrod Frank noticed a new type of patient arriving at his New York practice. Amid an explosion in the number of Americans losing weight with drugs like Ozempic, he saw a “dramatic spike” in clients experiencing unwelcome side effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9b00053b6nh5thy399@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Although they felt much better losing weight, in some ways they felt they looked older,” he said via a voice note. “And this was due to the loss of volume in their face.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00063b6n9ru2dikm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Frank started using the term “Ozempic face” — a label he believes he coined — to describe the phenomenon. It has since become a social media byword for the sagging skin and hollowed-out appearance that can accompany the use of GLP-1 medications like semaglutide (the active ingredient in branded drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00073b6ne8k7bvum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Usually, with people from their mid-40s and above, once you start losing 10-plus pounds, you can get this kind of deflated look,” said Frank, who is the founder of aesthetic health care brand PFRANKMD and the author of “The Pro-Aging Playbook.” “Certainly, people losing 20 or 30-plus pounds are going to have this problem.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Semaglutide works by stimulating the pancreas to trigger insulin production, curbing users’ appetite and contributing to feelings of fullness. Although the US Food and Drug Administration approved Ozempic to treat type 2 diabetes, doctors now commonly prescribe it off-label for weight management. About &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/health/ozempic-glp-1-survey-kff"&gt;1 in 8 adults&lt;/a&gt; in the US has used a GLP-1 drug, and of those, around 2 in 5 did so solely to lose weight, according to health policy non-profit KFF in 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00093b6nits8ca67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Today, more than 20% of Frank’s patients are using GLP-1s as part of what he called their “longevity regimen.” The treatments sought after their weight loss include injectable dermal fillers to help restore facial volume, facelifts and fat transfers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000a3b6nscxngb6s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You can only refill a deflated balloon so much, and often surgical intervention is necessary,” he said. But for many patients, he added, “just upping the dosage of their volume replacement is more than enough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000b3b6n1v7ljjqi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Someone who may have used one syringe of filler in the past is now using two or three.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000d3b6n2valg9vi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), which publishes an annual report on surgery trends, recently &lt;a href="https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/plastic-surgery-statistics" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that 2 in 5 of its members’ GLP-1 patients were considering undergoing cosmetic surgery — and 1 in 5 already had.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000e3b6nw9w4be7j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the patients opting for a facelift was Kimberly Bongiorno, a local government land use administrator from Mount Arlington, New Jersey. Having lost weight after gastric sleeve surgery in 2019, she regained 40 pounds during the Covid-19 pandemic and was prescribed Wegovy last year. Despite describing the drug’s impact as “almost a miracle” — taking her weight from 170 to 125 pounds — the 55-year-old faced new concerns over her appearance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000f3b6nxhghungw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Everything just kind of hung and was very loose,” she said over Zoom, recalling seeing her face in a photo shared by a friend. “I no longer felt like I had cheeks, and I had a lot of loose skin under my neck.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdpgwxcy00053b6n8bi79p0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It looked like I had melted. It was horrifying,” she added. “It was so disheartening to see how my face looked and how it had changed, I thought I looked a lot older than I am.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000h3b6n041gk21p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After consulting plastic surgeon Dr. Anthony Berlet at his New Jersey office, Bongiorno underwent a deep plane facelift that lifted her skin and repositioned some of the deeper muscles and connective tissues. She also opted for a neck lift that refined and smoothed her neck contours while addressing excess skin left by her weight loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000i3b6n8rlxoe1j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Before I did this, I probably looked closer to 60, or maybe even older. And now I have people who I’ve recently met think I am in my 40s,” Bongiorno said, adding: “People I haven’t seen in a while say, ‘You look so healthy and happy.’ And that’s nice to hear, because for a while, I didn’t look healthy and certainly wasn’t happy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdow3oyt00013b6nqb7buaxg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The number of facelifts performed in the US jumped 8% between 2022 and 2023, according to ASPS data. The use of hyaluronic acid fillers has meanwhile doubled from 2.6 million Americans in 2017 — the year Ozempic was first cleared for diabetes — to over 5.2 million in 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000j3b6nraxx0wud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The organization could not attribute these upticks exclusively to GLP-1 use, but its former president, Dr. Steven Williams, said the medications have had “a global effect on aesthetic surgery.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000k3b6nulksd71h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Now we have a brand-new tool that actually has efficacy for so many patients,” said Williams, a board-certified plastic surgeon and founder of California’s Tri Valley Plastic Surgery, over Zoom. He noted that GLP-1s come “without substantial drawbacks” when compared with invasive procedures like gastric bypass surgery.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000l3b6nja0cicus@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We can now have an honest conversation with patients about a nonsurgical tool that’s effective in weight loss,” he added. “And as part of that conversation, there’s an obligation to say, ‘Look, this is really going to work, so you have to be prepared for what looking 20 or 50 pounds slimmer is going to be.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000m3b6nfvlxtnax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The term “Ozempic face” may speak to our times, but its symptoms — caused by a decrease in the subcutaneous fat that makes our faces plump — are nothing new. Cosmetic surgeons have long been treating the side effects of significant weight loss. In fact, one popular brand of dermal filler, Sculptra, was originally developed in the 1990s for HIV patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000n3b6nqhyt41e7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As an adult, “your body actually doesn’t make more fat cells,” Williams said. “As we lose or gain weight, those fat cells aren’t multiplying or decreasing; they’re getting bigger or smaller. And so as we lose weight, those fat cells now have decreased volume, and there’s just less fullness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000p3b6ntoqjs5gh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Age can determine how patients’ faces react to weight loss. People in their 20s and 30s, for instance, are far less likely to experience the appearance of aging due to GLP-1 use, Frank said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000q3b6n052s2fcs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Because they have good skin elasticity, the skin rebounds much better,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000r3b6nvdudpl87@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients aged 20 to 39 accounted for 14% of hyaluronic acid filler use in the US and just 2% of facelift procedures last year, according to the ASPS. But both figures are &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/22/style/facelift-surgery-young-patients"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000s3b6n1l8jyodb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gabriela Vasquez, 29, is among the younger patients using GLP-1 to undergo cosmetic procedures after rapid weight loss. An employee of one of Williams’ Tri Valley Plastic Surgery clinics, she has dropped around 50 pounds since starting Ozempic in November.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000t3b6nlq5l8uoa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although Vasquez is still working toward her target weight, she sought preventative Botox injections (more visible lines and wrinkles are, along with thinning lips, among the other &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/ozempic-face-and-other-glp-1-side-effects" target="_blank"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; of GLP-1 use). She has also recently undergone microneedling, a procedure used to stimulate collagen production.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000u3b6nhcpzar5g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One of my concerns was my jowls, because I felt I saw them when I was a little heavier,” she said over Zoom from the Bay Area. “I think the microneedling definitely helped.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdpl54mn00043b6nye61yyaf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I never had a jaw line,” she added. “And a couple weeks ago, someone took a picture of me, and I had one, and I was like, ‘Well, that’s new.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000v3b6n0wme1p23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vasquez did not rule out further cosmetic procedures as she continues losing weight — and not only to her face and neck. “I’m seeing little things in my body that I’m like, ‘Whoa, that would be nice to take care of,’” she said, referencing the appearance of excess skin under her arms. “I could see myself — later down the line, once I get to my goal weight — doing something to kind of tighten everything up.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000w3b6nnbhl90lx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Frank, the cosmetic dermatologist, noted that “Ozempic face” may be accompanied by a phenomenon he dubbed “Ozempic body,” adding: “One of the other major side effects of weight loss, particularly when it’s done at a rate of more than one to two pounds a week, is muscle loss. And we see this all over the body.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The ASPS similarly notes the emerging term “Ozempic makeover,” a suite of procedures that might also include tummy tucks, breast lifts and arm, thigh and buttock lifts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000y3b6nxxzvj3iz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For instance, Bongiorno, the New Jersey facelift patient, has also undergone several other procedures with Dr. Berlet, including arm and thigh lifts, to address her excess skin. She estimates that after her upcoming breast lift, fat grafting and lower eyelid surgery, she will have spent about $80,000 on cosmetic procedures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c000z3b6n6upj7dqy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Skin is heavy and uncomfortable,” she said. “This wasn’t something I did to go out there and be a supermodel. It was just to be comfortable, so I could get clothes on and not feel like I was dragging around all this extra weight.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00113b6n3dcdzvt3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The long-term effect of GLP-1 medications on cosmetic medicine is yet to be fully understood. The assumption they might reduce demand for liposuction, for instance, has not come to bear: It remains the most common cosmetic surgical procedure in the US, growing in popularity by 1% last year, per ASPS data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00123b6nly8v4bdv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What also remains to be seen is the effect that “Ozempic rebound” — when patients regain weight after stopping the drugs — has on people who sought cosmetic procedures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00133b6nt12hy9ds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829779" target="_blank"&gt;recent peer-reviewed study&lt;/a&gt; found that most people using the drugs for weight loss quit within a year. Data presented at this year’s European Congress on Obesity meanwhile suggested that patients typically returned to their original weight within 10 months of stopping use, with University of Oxford researchers calling the findings a “cautionary note” about using medication “without a more comprehensive approach” to weight loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00143b6n3bbrn2z9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For Williams, this further demonstrates why he and his plastic surgeon colleagues must take responsibility for their patients’ “entire journey,” not just their cosmetic procedures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdoazm9c00153b6nauifw6cv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We don’t want these patients to be on these medications for a lifetime. We want it to be a temporary bridge to a healthier lifestyle,” he said, adding: “It’s our obligation to work harder with those patients, to talk about lifestyle changes, to get them plugged in to dietitians and to make sure that they’re building muscle and exercising.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

However, there have been more than 1,000 measles cases in the U.S. so far in 2025. Georgia has had &lt;a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/2025/06/georgia-reports-sixth-case-of-measles-of-the-year-health-officials-confirm/" target="_blank"&gt;six measles cases this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="8"&gt;Meanwhile, exemption rates are on the rise, from 2.5% of Georgia kindergartners in 2019-20 to 3.6% in 2023-24. Georgia &lt;a href="https://dph.georgia.gov/schoolvaccines" target="_blank"&gt;requires several vaccine&lt;/a&gt;s before students can enroll in school or child care, including MMR, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis and polio. Students can receive exemptions for medical or religious reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="9"&gt;Although vaccine skepticism existed well before the COVID-19 pandemic, some physicians have noticed an increase in reluctance to vaccinate their children in the last few years. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2U0csKvqMY" target="_blank"&gt;recently told CBS News&lt;/a&gt; that measles outbreaks are inevitable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-subscription__placeholder subscription-promo b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="11"&gt;“We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the vaccine wanes very quickly,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-nativo_placeholder--moap b-clear-both "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="14"&gt;Physicians disagree. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="15"&gt;“The adverse events from a vaccine are so very minimal compared to the devastating effect from the disease,” said Dr. Nicola Chin, a pediatrician at Morehouse Healthcare. Chin spent part of a recent morning trying to persuade three parents to inoculate their children. Only one agreed to the DTaP vaccine, since rates of pertussis are on the rise in Georgia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-component  b-margin-bottom-d40-m20  image-landscape" data-index="16"&gt;&lt;div class="image-component-image inline "&gt;&lt;div class="enlargeImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: arvin.temkar@ajc.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="[object%20Object]" class="image-expand" alt="icon to expand image"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: arvin.temkar@ajc.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="18"&gt;“We are seeing a lot more distrust, and that has escalated past COVID into now, and it was present before,” Chin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="RP09 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="21"&gt;Chin, the president of the Georgia chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said physicians are spending more time combating misinformation patients find online. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="22"&gt;“(Patients say,) ‘That vaccine has poison in it. I’ve seen on TikTok that kids will die (from the) vaccine,’” Chin said. “Pediatricians across the state have to address (these kinds of comments) and be able to restore trust.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="24"&gt;Restoring trust can be challenging, as Chin has found, in a splintered media landscape where misinformation and disinformation are rampant. She’s also concerned about households where older children have been vaccinated, but younger siblings have not been because of growing distrust among some parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="25"&gt;Dr. Felipe Lobelo, a medical epidemiologist and&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a program director at Kaiser Permanente of Georgia, said in addition to skepticism, people became wary after the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="PX01 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="27"&gt;“People are tired of hearing about vaccines,” he said. The pandemic sort of created … a legacy of increased mistrust and some disinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="28"&gt;But, Lobelo said, it’s important to understand that not all diseases are equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="29"&gt;“COVID is better controlled now than it was five years ago, and vaccination ... is still important, but it’s not as critical as it was back in 2019. But you cannot say the same thing for measles,” he said. “Immune systems that have not been exposed to measles — one of the most infectious diseases we have ever known — are going to get infected if they’re not properly vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="30"&gt;While deaths from measles are rare, the disease is highly contagious and can lead to other conditions like pneumonia, encephalitis.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;In recent years scientists have also discovered that measles can break down the immune system generally, making children unable to fight off a wide array of diseases they used to be protected against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="31"&gt;Lobelo said the decline in childhood inoculations is an “all hands on deck” situation for physicians and educators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="34"&gt;“I encourage families to find other trusted sources of information … so that people can make informed decisions,” he said. “Ultimately, we cannot force anyone to take vaccines, but people need to make informed choices of the risks that they take if they don’t get vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-connext hyperlocal_promo b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-connext eos-msg__nolog-or-nosub b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;Which vaccines do Georgia schools require? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="39"&gt;Children enrolled in any Georgia public school, child care center or Head Start program need to complete the Georgia Certificate of Immunization. Young children are required to get specific doses of immunizations, including MMR, polio and DTaP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="40"&gt;Students entering seventh grade are also required to get the meningococcal conjugate vaccine. Students entering 11th grade will need a meningococcal booster shot unless they received their first dose on or after their 16th birthday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="41"&gt;Some school districts, like Fulton County, have grace periods for students who enroll without all of the required vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="42"&gt;“We don’t want the lack of documents to prevent a kid from being in the classroom,” Fulton Superintendent Mike Looney said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP04 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="44"&gt;Looney said the district dis-enrolls some students who aren’t up to date on vaccines, “But I would say those are few and far between.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="45"&gt;Read more about &lt;a href="https://dph.georgia.gov/schoolvaccines" target="_blank"&gt;Georgia’s school vaccine requirements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AJC.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 09:25:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNdkVMNWM2eUtscDFZV3E4MHV2MTAzU0NRZHJMNG5ORUtLNGFyX0x2akFnVEt1dFN6NVU3YXo3Rmp5Tklocmo4a083ZEJTSDJaanpRUDRIVFZaMFNFSTNiOEpySDdVVzZKcG5FeWNfcHBmcjlmaTBRT1BrdjBsbTZCaHk0ZGxtVWJEY19Td2hJYW9OZmptYW15UVZuWjJxOWJtal95ci1ob2MyS3Fk</guid></item><item><title>在威斯特摩兰蚊子中发现的西尼罗河、詹姆斯敦峡谷病毒；莱姆病风险高- TribLIVE.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPeFZGNTNUVkN2VldEcThyVGl3V2VmWU1rbUI1TVVHdTBlc1dUVVZQVWdqY1N4UXl0N181U3hOeTJBOTBFTFQyd3Fabng4RFl6dmk2SkdMc2F2LUEzSzYwbEtDY196MG5xMG1qZ0NucUNMZEdjNDZFMzBxSDlfQkdzVHRUZzRiSDJ4ZTJPZndsWm9fenZZY1hpUXNjZW8xR3JQYlpYX2RJNjJYNk5HNG1jRTF6elMwblo1d3VMYlRuTU8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;

                Heat poses an extra risk for millions of Americans who take medications for issues ranging from high blood pressure to antidepressants.

        David Goldman/AP
        
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For the millions of Americans who take medications for common issues like heart disease or high blood pressure, a heatwave like the one causing sweltering conditions across the Central and Southeastern U.S. this week poses extra risk.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's because some medications can change how people's bodies naturally manage heat, says David Eisenman, a physician and researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, potentially making people more susceptible to overheating.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Eisenman stresses that patients should still take their medications. But he urges them to take the risks from heat seriously and develop a plan to keep cool — by taking steps like cooling their homes with air conditioning or fans, drinking water and staying out of the hot sun.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do some medications affect heat tolerance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The consequences of overheating can be dramatic: an overstrained heart, kidney issues, brain damage and even death are possible when internal temperatures climb too high for too long.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think of core temperature as your body's internal temperature like a car engine," says Eisenman. A car, like a body, needs to keep its engine at a reasonable temperature.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bodies adjust in many ways. They can calibrate the amount and saltiness of sweat. A mechanism in your brain can trigger a sensation of thirst, prompting you to drink enough water to create enough sweat. The vascular system shunts more blood toward the skin, where it can be cooled by breeze or evaporating sweat.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But some classes of medications — from some beta blockers to diuretics to antidepressants — can affect the way people's bodies react to, or perceive, heat. ACE inhibitors, commonly prescribed for heart issues, make it harder to realize you're thirsty, and beta blockers — another heart medication — can decrease sweating, making it harder to cool off.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When you're taking these medications and you're exposed to heat, it's like asking a car to drive up a mountain in the summer with the air conditioner broken, low on coolant and no warning signals," Eisenman says. "Overheating becomes much more likely."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean you should stop taking your medications during heat waves, Eisenman stresses. It means keeping yourself from getting too hot in the first place. "Making sure people have access to a cool space" should be the priority, he says, whether that's running an air conditioner at home or finding a local cooling center.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What medications increase heat risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heat-health/hcp/clinical-guidance/heat-and-medications-guidance-for-clinicians.html" target="_blank"&gt;catalogs many different medications that could interfere with the body's heat management system&lt;/a&gt;, based on how different types of drugs work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Millions of Americans take ACE inhibitors or ARBs to manage high blood pressure. But they can affect people's ability to sense thirst, potentially leaving them dehydrated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beta blockers can keep blood from flowing toward the skin, where it can cool, and decrease sweat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diuretics, commonly prescribed for kidney problems, may contribute to dehydration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anticholinergic medications — including some over-the-counter antihistamines, like Benadryl — can reduce sweating. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antipsychotics can make it harder for people to sense their own temperature, so they can't tell when they're overheating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many other drugs, including ADHD medications and some antidepressants, could also influence heat risk.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Older people generally have a harder time managing heat even without added medication risks, says Rutgers University physician and researcher Soko Setaguchi. She led &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0243665&amp;amp;type=printable" target="_blank"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; focused on Medicare patients — all of whom were older than 65 — that found the chance of ending up in the hospital after summer heat waves was higher for those taking anticholinergics and antipsychotics, along with ACE-inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But like Eisenman, she stresses that patients shouldn't stop taking medications when it's hot. "The message for now is, there are potential risks," she says, so patients should strive to "avoid heat, anticipate heat and plan for heat."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is still unknown?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The theoretical ways drugs can affect heat tolerance are well-known, but there haven't been enough systematic analyses looking at how, and at what levels, and for whom drugs affect heat tolerance, says Yorgi Mavros, a heat expert at The University of Sydney. But some messages have begun to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;During the heat dome that descended on the Pacific Northwest in 2021, people who had been prescribed medications, including anti-epileptic drugs, antipsychotics and some beta blockers, were &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/ebiom/PIIS2352-3964(25)00232-4.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;more likely to have died&lt;/a&gt; during the extreme heat than people who hadn't been prescribed those drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another study looked at the risk of heart attacks during &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00102-z#data-availability" target="_blank"&gt;extreme heat events in Germany&lt;/a&gt;. The chance of dying went up if patients had used anti-platelet medication and beta-receptor blockers, compared to patients who weren't on the medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another looked at the effect of different medications on kidney-related hospitalizations in the Atlanta area during the summer months. Patients on antidepressants and patients taking multiple medications at once ended up in the hospital at a higher rate, says lead researcher Zachary McCann, who was at Emory University at the time the study was published.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's common that patients will take many medications at once, says McCann. Yet, he says, the combined risks have not been assessed thoroughly — a concern echoed by Eisenman and Mavros.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The urgency to answer some of these questions is growing, says McCann. Climate change &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/25/nx-s1-5444040/the-role-of-climate-change-in-the-dangerous-heat-dome#:~:text=Scientists%20have%20crunched%20the%20numbers,%2D%20versus%2097%2Ddegree%20weather" target="_blank"&gt;intensifies heat,&lt;/a&gt; stretches the length of heat waves and drags summers later into the year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Summers are going to get hotter. They're going to get longer," he says. "We know that heat causes dysregulation of all kinds of organ systems and wreaks havoc on the body in all kinds of different ways." So, McCann says it's critical that patients and doctors work together to make plans to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Prevention is really the best medication when it comes to the management of heat," he says.&lt;/p&gt;

Dozens of drugs &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079219300504?via%3Dihub"&gt;have failed to show efficacy&lt;/a&gt; in clinical trials, and while HGNS was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2014, Miller says that its rollout has been limited, as many doctors are uncertain about the risk-to-benefit trade-off. “The device is quite costly, and the implantation requires a surgical procedure,” he explains, which comes with added risk to the patient. “As with any new technology, there is often a lag in acceptance from both the medical community and insurers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;It’s unlikely that a single therapy will be found as an alternative to CPAP, Gaisl argues, because sleep apnea isn’t one single disease—rather, a diverse cluster of conditions. Obesity is known to be one of the major risk factors—and the weight-loss drug tirzepatide has &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-medication-obstructive-sleep-apnea"&gt;recently been licensed&lt;/a&gt; as a sleep apnea therapy—because excess fat around the neck and upper body can obstruct the airway and cause pauses in breathing. But there are many other causes, some of which are only recently coming to light. Researchers are now beginning to understand the impact of ethnicity on sleep apnea, for example, with patients in Asia at &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21992683/"&gt;heightened risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Sleep apnea is resultant of “a mosaic of different things, not just obesity,” says Gaisl. “We’re increasingly seeing that different subgroups benefit most from more personalized approaches.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;This recognition has led researchers to focus more on the EDS population. Gaisl estimates that simply having EDS is equivalent to increasing your BMI by 11 points in terms of the likelihood of developing sleep apnea. That’s because the genes linked to EDS affect the structure of so-called “matrix proteins” like collagen and elastin, which provide the framework for the body’s connective tissues—everything from skin to tendons, muscles, and ligaments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Collagen is an integral part of almost all tissues, including those which form the airway,” says Karim Ghobrial-Sedky, an adjunct professor at Drexel University and a sleep specialist who has treated EDS patients with sleep apnea. “In EDS, it’s this abnormality in collagen which makes the airway more prone to collapsing when the person is taking a breath.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Because of this, researchers believe that EDS sleep apnea patients are especially suited to treatments targeting muscles in the tongue and throat—like Miller’s HGNS, or a newer drug combination under development by a company called Apnimed. Based on the discovery that two compounds, atomoxetine and aroxybutynin, could work in synergy to improve upper airway muscle tone and reduce airway muscle relaxation during sleep, Apnimed has been shown &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/sleep-apnea-pill-shows-striking-success-large-clinical-trial"&gt;in a clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; to reduce instances of sleep apnea by 56 percent. “People with hypermobility are a prime target cohort for these kinds of therapies,” says Gaisl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549814/"&gt;EDS was long considered rare&lt;/a&gt;, recent studies &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/11/e031365"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; genetic hypermobility may affect as many as 1 in 500 people, with women disproportionately affected. Gaisl believes the underlying biology behind these conditions also offers clues for explaining other subtypes of sleep apnea. In his view, the genetics of EDS actively mirrors the damage which other people are inadvertently inflicting on their matrix proteins through behaviors and environmental stresses like smoking, chronic inflammation, excessive dietary sugar and the aging process itself, heightening their risk of sleep apnea through midlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“EDS is a kind of natural experiment which is giving us insights into some of the key biological mechanisms behind sleep apnea that are masked in the general population,” says Gaisl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Such individuals could benefit more from targeted therapies like HGNS or Apnimed’s drug combination, compared with patients whose apnea is primarily driven by weight gain or underlying breathing abnormalities. Newer diagnostics are applying AI algorithms to patients’ sleep data, pinpointing key patterns that suggest a specific type of airway collapse. In the future, these tools could help clinicians to identify such people both faster and more accurately, as well as individuals with undiagnosed hypermobility. These insights could then be used to tailor their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As researchers learn more about the role of matrix proteins in EDS-related sleep apnea, it could even pave the way for entirely new treatments in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Matrix proteins “really point to the importance of collagen in maintaining the airway during sleep,” says Gaisl. “This opens up a new avenue for therapeutics which perhaps target how the connective tissues are impacted over time, causing sleep apnea—treatments which could ultimately benefit a much broader range of patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTFBMNGlYUVBZT1BFQ2JFMjduLXF5Ym9TdEFrTWNzcnFFa0E2Q1dkZDFteGZrbzRjbUItajE1MEp1M2J5aGJZNzg3X1JDUFlFeUhVYVJycjFnbjNvbnNxUlNraVhPbFZOUQ</guid></item><item><title>我在医院内外度过了童年。19岁时，我终于意识到我患有晚期疾病- theguardian.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxQVV9ySEJERmdLMV9KQWhTVjY4OXI4Unh5RnMxczloem9lZlZEYkdtZTBVY1ZNQjJGeS1yVlZkUU1IREhYM2s5STNRaHE4eXZYVk55TlY0WTZjSnAzRUZJcDZjQ3NPVDAtd1lERnltXzBJNUNhM0g5clh2NjFTejBqTmFtZHR4NGhkRTVWZUpiRmtLRDQ2cXNZMWtpTkxxaW9NY3JFSjl4eUNlSEpfQ3pMd05wNHlvb0lvSnRpV0M5YUwyaWRocXlzSkVB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;vonne Hughes was 19, and attending the funeral of a friend with cystic fibrosis, when she realised: “Oh shit, I’m going to die of this.” She had met him during shared hospital stays in childhood, and although Hughes had always known she had CF, she had never understood her illness as terminal until that day in 1992, when she stood at the back of the crowded chapel&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in Glasgow. For three days afterwards, she couldn’t stop crying. “I had a kind of meltdown. That’s probably the first time I thought that this thing I had was going to kill me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over the next few months, Hughes, who was studying at the University of Glasgow, listened to her mum, dad and older sister chatting during family meals as if she was a ghost at the table. “I pulled back from them. I deliberately didn’t talk or include myself,” she says. “I wanted them to get used to sitting and chatting without me, so that when I died, they wouldn’t notice I wasn’t there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/series/how-we-survive","type":"Series","title":"How we survive"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/cystic-fibrosis","type":"Keyword","title":"Cystic fibrosis"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","type":"Keyword","title":"Health &amp;amp; wellbeing"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/paulacocozza","type":"Contributor","title":"Paula Cocozza","twitterHandle":"CocozzaPaula","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/10/24/1382620904259/Paula-Cocozza.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=5fb020dc0b4c8b67416423a48d539385"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/g2","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"G2"},{"id":"theguardian/g2/features","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Comment &amp;amp; features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-features","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-production","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 production"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"lifeandstyle/2025/jul/30/i-spent-childhood-in-out-hospital-at-19-finally-realised-had-terminal-disease","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s a harrowing responsibility for a teenager to take, but self-erasure must have felt like a way to pre-empt death, perhaps to resist it. When she was growing up, &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cystic-fibrosis/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cystic fibrosis&lt;/a&gt; was considered “a childhood disease” – because about half of those diagnosed did not survive their teens. A genetic condition in which the body creates thick, sticky mucus, it makes digestion difficult, damages lung function and can lead to respiratory failure. It affects about 160,000 people globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now 52, and enjoying what she calls a “second chance” at life more than 30 years later, Hughes has emerged as a comedian. We are speaking on a video call before her one-hour show, &lt;a href="https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/yvonne-hughes-absolutely-riddled" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Absolutely Riddled&lt;/a&gt;, which she is performing at the Edinburgh fringe, based on her experiences of living with the condition. “I want to be true to myself and my story,” she says. Why does she think she survived when so many didn’t?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ab5dfed0-a7d8-4100-990f-c1cb4844da92" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘My mum said: “We thought you were going to die, every day”’ … Hughes, far right, with her hospital friends on a day trip in 1984. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For most of her childhood, Hughes, who works as a community development worker in Renfrewshire, didn’t regard herself as struggling for survival. Her parents didn’t sit her down in childhood to explain her illness; she had been diagnosed at six weeks old. But there were hospital visits and tablets and eating often made her vomit. Gradually, she says, she “put together those two words, cystic and fibrosis, with something that I had”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At school, she kept her illness hidden, taking her medication at home. She was popular; joined the Brownies, then Guides. “I’m a very level-headed person, but I keep a lot in my mind. I remember when I was younger thinking: ‘There’s no point telling people about this because everyone is dealing with something. I’m nothing special.’ I just got on with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Roughly one in every 2,500 people are born with cystic fibrosis in the UK, Australia and the US. Hughes’s older sister does not have the illness and the family had no idea what it meant for their lives, or for Hughes herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Only as she grew older did Hughes build a sense of the precariousness of her life. “My mum said to me: ‘We thought you were going to die, every day. We just didn’t know.’ It became their new normal to keep me alive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If she got a chest infection, pleurisy or pneumonia, she would go into hospital, and over the years made friends on the CF ward, a fragile community. When the curtains were closed around a bed for a long time, Hughes and the other children knew not to go past. She reasoned with herself, to allay her fears: “People were dying around me but I put it down to: ‘Maybe they had a really bad infection, maybe they were worse than me.’” In childhood, she developed “a lot of level-headed thought processes around why those people died”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ef167e92-7322-4878-b506-9ba8e789f235" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘I thought there was no point telling people because everyone was dealing with something. I was nothing special.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She found solace in the &lt;a href="https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Cystic Fibrosis Trust&lt;/a&gt; magazine, and dreamed of attending one of the advertised camps. “Luckily, I didn’t,” she says, because in the early 1990s, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7513755/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;scientists discovered&lt;/a&gt; that the camps were a hotbed for the spread of bacteria, present in the lungs and phlegm of children with CF. Many cross-infected each other, some with fatal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Did Hughes struggle to accept that sense of herself, as both vulnerable and a threat? “Absolutely,” she says. Hospitals implemented &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2443994/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a policy of segregation&lt;/a&gt;, according to bacteria carried. Hughes has the pseudomonas bacteria, and after her friend’s funeral in 1992, she stopped seeing people with cystic fibrosis in case they had different bacteria or bugs that &lt;a href="https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk/what-is-cystic-fibrosis/how-does-cystic-fibrosis-affect-the-body/symptoms-of-cystic-fibrosis/lungs/bugs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;might lead to cross-infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She has stayed in touch by phone with one old friend. “We shared growing up in the hospital ward and I do love speaking to him.” But after that funeral, “I became reckless,” she says. “I thought: ‘Well, life’s for living. I’m just going to do what I want.’ I didn’t care very much for myself. I thought: ‘What’s the point?’ I spiralled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Her 20s and 30s passed in a blur of “festivals, partying, travelling when I could, flying by the seat of my pants … ” She had hoped to meet someone, and to have children. “I thought it would happen. And it never did.” In her 30s, her lung function got so low – 45%, then 36% – that she wouldn’t have been able to sustain a pregnancy anyway. “That was something I tried to grieve. But over the course of a year, I thought: ‘I’d rather be alive.’ My mantra became: ‘I’d rather have a full and short life than a long and unhappy one.’ These kinds of philosophical things got me through.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hughes doesn’t have a mantra now – “other than trying to be funny”. The frequency of her performances range from three times a week to every few weeks, depending on her health needs. But even in her reckless phase, she embodied a stoicism, too. She worked throughout – at a call centre, a radio station, the CF Trust. “I just had to keep going, pay my bills and mortgage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Did she ever wonder: “Why me?” She has had years of spitting out and swallowing mucus – “constant, constant” – hankies everywhere, non-stop sterilising of stuff, endless medication and pain, unable to take the next breath for granted. As a child, when she went into hospital, there was a faint sense of privilege at being given Lucozade and new slippers, things her sister didn’t get. But no one else in her family has the illness. Didn’t she feel aggrieved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s a difficult question,” she says. “I’ve thought about ‘Why me?’ in a positive sense – that it was me because I could handle it. Or, I’m glad … because this has made me the way I am.” She has also thought, “Why at all? Why did cystic fibrosis come into being? Why have this weird disease that just kind of ruins lives?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="5d105e5a-32ce-4299-9905-e9ea3244dd7f" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘I just got on with it.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Yvonne Hughes/PA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While Hughes survived childhood by reminding herself that she wasn’t special, the differences between her life and others’ sharpened as she entered her 40s. She became an aunt, and bore close witness to her peers’ life transitions while she kept on being “just Yvonne – the one that never reached any potential”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I couldn’t have a career because I would always get ill. I never moved social class. I always remained working class.” Her dad was a welder, her mother a GP receptionist. “Everything I did, I did myself. But it was day by day, week by week. There was never a plan. I always felt I could never get ahead of myself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In 2018, aged 45, with deteriorating health, Hughes took redundancy from her job as public affairs officer at the CF Trust.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Eating was difficult. Her weight hovered around 7 stone. She braced herself for the possibility of a lung transplant, but as her lung capacity dropped to 30%, she was deemed too ill for the waiting list. “I was like: ‘OK, that door’s closed. At this point, there isn’t anything else on the horizon to keep me alive.’” She completed an &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dwp-factual-medical-reports-guidance-for-healthcare-professionals/the-special-rules-how-the-benefit-system-supports-people-nearing-the-end-of-life" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;end-of-life form&lt;/a&gt;, and met the palliative care team. She thought: “I’ll see my days out with my parents, make memories and know I did well to get to 48.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Then, in 2020, the UK government granted access to a new drug, Kaftrio. Hughes had read about its worldwide trials. When the delivery driver knocked on the door, she told him: “You’re going to save my life.” At that point, her lung function was down to 26%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Within an hour or two of the first tablet, she started coughing. “They call it the purge,” she says. There was so much mucus – dark, watery and horribly fascinating – she captured it in a cup, put a lid on it, and stowed it in a drawer in her bedroom. “I kept that cup for a long time,” she says. Maybe she already knew it was a relic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Kaftrio turned Hughes’s life “a whole 180, literally overnight”. There are side-effects – insomnia, weight gain, which have brought other challenges – but before long, she says, “I could breathe again without coughing. I went back to work within the year. I could run, I could dance, I could speak, I could stand up straight and cook. I used to always be bent over, catching my breath. And then all of a sudden that was gone. It was a miracle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Energised, she decided to enrol in an evening course. Acrylic painting, maybe, or playing the keyboard? But at the University of Strathclyde’s &lt;a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/studywithus/centreforlifelonglearning/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Centre for Lifelong Learning&lt;/a&gt;, it was the flyer for comedy that caught her eye. “I had always loved going to gigs.

I got Red Raw [the Stand’s beginners’ slot] and went from there.

Having spent a lifetime feeling unable “to rely on a future”, she has had to learn to picture one – and to override her old instinct to absent herself to mitigate later losses. Sometimes, this means catching herself in the act of “pulling back” from Alan, and letting the pleasure she takes in his company teach her to quiet her mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Life now is so different, it requires a conscious effort to remember how hard it was from one moment to the next. “I used to breathe so shallowly that I had to take a – &lt;em&gt;haa!&lt;/em&gt; – sharp intake of breath – to feel I was breathing,” she says. The sound punctuated even the simplest actions – after getting into a car, for instance, after reaching for her seatbelt, after pulling it across her, after fastening it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Now I can get in the car, pull the seatbelt over and go. I can walk and talk. I can laugh without wetting myself or going into a convulsion of coughing, pulling a muscle or breaking a rib,” she says. “It is a horrible, horrible disease. It suffocates you. It takes every inch of your breath away. And now it is something I can live with and not die from. I’ll probably live to get my pension.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Comedy has brought “fun, joy and laughter” back into Hughes’s life. But it has also given her something that nothing else has. “I had never found anything for me in my life. I’d never married. I had no children. So I had no community. Nothing,” she says. “There were people getting their careers and their lives sorted. Comedy was the one thing that was for me. And it still is. Just for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>theguardian.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxQVV9ySEJERmdLMV9KQWhTVjY4OXI4Unh5RnMxczloem9lZlZEYkdtZTBVY1ZNQjJGeS1yVlZkUU1IREhYM2s5STNRaHE4eXZYVk55TlY0WTZjSnAzRUZJcDZjQ3NPVDAtd1lERnltXzBJNUNhM0g5clh2NjFTejBqTmFtZHR4NGhkRTVWZUpiRmtLRDQ2cXNZMWtpTkxxaW9NY3JFSjl4eUNlSEpfQ3pMd05wNHlvb0lvSnRpV0M5YUwyaWRocXlzSkVB</guid></item><item><title>GP - BBC表示，不受监管的“肉毒杆菌毒素”病例“令人难以置信的可怕”</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1SbndvV2V6Tm5DaFRFM2Y3cHRvTHk4ZUF2WEJkUXkwZy1BRU5iZDdKSGt4dGJIS0xLYUVROFA2bHFTSnNPOXI4SDZYM2ZxcUFiQmROUjkxZ25vd9IBX0FVX3lxTE5neU1vWHBRYTFhU0MwbHB3dDhwdmU0QktKdFdsY1pGZ2xKR2djVlJHcG1CMklsVE0yNk5MdlVZcTNHT09vdno5SDhhTm5fcVcxRjBKWWkxMkN0MGNZTDhv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Unregulated 'Botox' cases are frightening, says GP&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 bwIYVa"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Emma Baugh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 fRRQoT"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News, Peterborough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-11 lnQEDG"&gt;Reporting from&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 32 32" category="personalisation" icon="location" class="sc-9c8c5e05-0 kHfxfq"&gt;&lt;path d="M12.3 11c0 2.1 1.7 3.7 3.7 3.7s3.7-1.7 3.7-3.7-1.6-3.7-3.7-3.7S12.3 9 12.3 11zm2.9 20c-3-4.4-5.6-8.5-7.3-12.1-1.5-3-2.1-5.6-2.1-7.9C5.7 5.5 10.1 1 16 1s10.3 4.6 10.3 10c0 2.3-.7 4.9-2.1 7.9-1.7 3.6-4.3 7.7-7.3 12.1h-1.7z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Peterborough &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Harriet Heywood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News, Peterborough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ce11/live/cbb9b9f0-6bb3-11f0-82e5-136004252dd4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ce11/live/cbb9b9f0-6bb3-11f0-82e5-136004252dd4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ce11/live/cbb9b9f0-6bb3-11f0-82e5-136004252dd4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ce11/live/cbb9b9f0-6bb3-11f0-82e5-136004252dd4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ce11/live/cbb9b9f0-6bb3-11f0-82e5-136004252dd4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ce11/live/cbb9b9f0-6bb3-11f0-82e5-136004252dd4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ce11/live/cbb9b9f0-6bb3-11f0-82e5-136004252dd4.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ce11/live/cbb9b9f0-6bb3-11f0-82e5-136004252dd4.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Emma Baugh/BBC Dr Qayyum has long dark hair and is smiling at the camera.
