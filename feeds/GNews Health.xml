There will always be a new study highlighting the benefits or risks of eating just about anything.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is Howard Tucker and his wife of 68 years Sara Siegel on their wedding day in 1957. The couple are very happy together&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;America's waistline has been ballooning for decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2024, some 43 percent of Americans were considered obese, compared to just 13 percent in the 1960s, when Dr Tucker first graduated med school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data also suggests that in the late 1970s, Americans got about six percent of their calories from fast food. Today, that has nearly doubled to 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And research shows not only are Americans eating more, but the size and calorie content of store bought and fast food has surged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 1986 and 2016, studies suggest that the average burger has gained 39 grams in weight and contains 90 more calories. It also now has 41.6 percent of the daily salt allowance, compared to 27.8 percent initially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For fast food desserts, the average one now weighs an extra 71 grams and contains 186 more calories than it did four decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tucker, who is from Ohio, suggested in his interview that one of the ways to counteract this is to eat meals you cooked yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The grandfather-of-10, does allow himself the occasional treat — saying he is partial to ice cream and donuts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But his treat drawer also includes, perhaps uniquely, pickles that he likes to make himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tucker indulges in the occasional martini too, having &lt;span&gt;not being scared off by the recent studies suggesting alcohol may raise someone's risk of cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the neurologist is eager to stress that, like so much in life, 'moderation' is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To me, moderation seems to be correct,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People often suggest that eating X or strictly following Y routine will help you live longer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't believe in extremes or fads. In fact, I think going to extremes can be more harmful than helpful. Certainly, genetics and luck play an enormous role. Beyond that, I believe the key is everything in moderation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Tucker is pictured above with one of his snacks, pickles, which he likes to make himself by mixing brine with cucumbers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tucker is also no stranger to exercise, even a month before his 103rd birthday, saying he still uses a treadmill in his home gym — although at a much slower pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also tries to jog when he can and walks a lot, saying this 'strengthens your heart and stimulates your brain'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It hasn't all been plain sailing with his health, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He injured his neck in a skiing accident at the age of 80 years, he said, which led his family to ban him from the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tucker also encourages people to continually seek knowledge and connection, saying this provides vital stimulation that keeps the brain active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When people ask me about longevity, as a real punkster, I would say: wine, women and song,' he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like his father, Dr Tucker has made sure to try and have friends at least a few decades younger than himself, saying this helps to stimulate him to think better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it's not all about pleasure and socializing, he believes in strengthening the brain through learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tucker completed a law degree at age 67 years in 1989, and still regularly reads neurology journals to stimulate his brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He is still chasing new skills even now, having signed up for a computer course most recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Tucker is pictured above at the 29th Annual Webby Awards in New York in May this year. He was named winner for the award 'Best of the Internet'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Tucker has also won an award from the Guinness World Records book as the oldest practicing doctor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tucker also warns that people should never retire, blasting this as the 'enemy of longevity' because it reduces someone's decision-making and social interaction — which may hasten decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tucker stopped working in 2022 after the hospital where he worked closed, but said he would still be there if it was open. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has applied for new jobs, but keeps getting rejected — which he says is likely because of his age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 16:53:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxPUGRuY1lOdFo1dHhxOTJvZVBia0hoTHR5VGo2enE3eF8yMmVIb0hkNDFMR2xwV01uekJvQ1VYR1psaEQzVFdCMDhJU2hlazc5aHY2cjhvTy0xcVF1NHo5a291MkJHSDJ4X2llbnI3M3ZYaFZmc25yaWN5VHc0OUM3RUNqVUlRVnhvLTZaYzVWUld0bFMwaXZ4SWFmeDFyQ1lyVWxBdXZqTGFLR0hEM1VPMEs1Ty04Z2pv0gG-AUFVX3lxTE03R3k1Z0RmLVpNako4TE15TXVqVTNyMVNtcWF4MDhCbzkxS0dLVGZIaFQxTEZBdDkyN2ZuR1lkMm0wTWNsX0RVMGx5RDd5Q0JVM1JIOEpTOVRZNEwyUzhCdzh5NWY5RWwtR0hvR294eVcyMV9qSWNUUkgxejdKZEdRQnhuN19CbHlRV0dsSXVtbU84LTJEOTZCTDFVZUVVYmp3RkRJQy1YZXNURVJKSGI2V0ItSlh5cGlPZ1JXX0E</guid></item><item><title>又有2名犹他州人被诊断出患有麻疹，使该州总数达到5人- KSL新闻 | 2 more Utahns diagnosed with measles, bringing state total to 5 - KSL News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxNNWJTUDBNOTBHbHIzbWI3TkE0TWVNbFVCaE4wTmtMRVpnOXhKUVpUdkJBWUdjSVZKU09vOE41RmFpRUFTWF9zTU83OTQ5emNTSVVRUmt5NjhMazd4UGZQZTh3TWIwXzJvQVd0Zzd6ZWs3NEZFbFpjam1YNE1GdEQ0NWhUTm5QMzVYd0NoZlpRaUxySHZkMjBGbHcyMWhWZ0pp?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — Utah public health officials on Thursday became aware of two more people diagnosed with measles, bringing the total cases in the state to five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the newly identified individuals with measles is a minor and the other is an adult, according to a news release from the Utah Department of Health and Human Services. One person is a Utah County resident and the other is from the southwest health district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, two of the five Utahns who have been diagnosed with measles had to be hospitalized due to complications but have since been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Among the five positive cases that have been reported, two of the people diagnosed with measles in Utah are unvaccinated, pregnant Utahns," said the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's additions to the measles count in the state follow closely on the heels of &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51334912" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;two other measles diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, also from Utah County and the southwest health district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials on Tuesday said during the first person's "infectious period but prior to diagnosis," the person visited "several" public places. This included the Timpanogos Regional Emergency Room on June 14 between 2:14 p.m. and 7:02 p.m., and the Parkway Health Center in Orem on June 13, though no specific time was given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early stages of measles symptoms — high fever, cough, runny nose or red eyes — usually appear seven to 14 days after exposure. A rash typically appears after four days of fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has been exposed to measles or is showing symptoms should call a health care provider first before visiting a clinic to prevent spreading the disease to others, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A large majority of Utahns (more than 90%) have been vaccinated against measles and are highly protected against infection," the health department said. "Measles is a highly contagious disease that can cause serious illness, especially in young children, pregnant women and people who have weakened immune systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Another potential measles exposure is being investigated in Northern Virginia after someone with a confirmed case of the virus traveled through Dulles International Airport last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Virginia Department of Health, the person went through Dulles’ Concourse A and the baggage area between 7:45 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. on June 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That person then headed through the departures area of the main terminal, east security checkpoint, on transportation to Concourse C and inside Concourse C between 8 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VDH said the person was an international traveler visiting North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials are working to figure out who might have been exposed and contacting passengers on specific flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, VDH said there have been three reported cases of measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, a &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2025/05/2nd-case-of-measles-has-been-confirmed-in-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;case of measles&lt;/a&gt; was confirmed in May after the state’s first measles case of 2025 was &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2025/04/virginia-department-of-health-warns-of-potential-measles-exposure-in-woodbridge-fredericksburg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed in April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And D.C. health officials &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/dc/2025/06/dc-health-officials-confirm-case-of-measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed a case in the District earlier this month.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is defined as “a highly contagious viral respiratory disease that spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes,” DC Health said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest measles information from VDH is available &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/measles/#2025-exposures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, there have been close to 1,200 confirmed measles cases this year, &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2025/06/measles-outbreaks-in-michigan-and-pennsylvania-end-while-texas-logs-just-4-new-cases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. With the rise in measles cases, the CDC is urging all people traveling internationally to be &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2025/06/all-international-travelers-should-get-measles-vaccinations-cdc-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fully vaccinated against the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                
                &lt;p class="After-content"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As temperatures rise, so does the risk of heat-related illness – especially for people taking certain prescription drugs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The body uses several mechanisms to regulate temperature: sweating, blood flow to the skin and fluid balance. But some commonly prescribed drugs interfere with these processes, making it harder to stay cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few you should know about this summer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Antidepressants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two specific types of antidepressants – &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/medicines-and-psychiatry/ssri-antidepressants/overview/"&gt;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; (SSRIs) and &lt;a href="https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/depression/prescribing-information/tricyclic-antidepressants/"&gt;tricyclics&lt;/a&gt; (TCAs) – may make summer harder to cope with. They could even cause &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-62496985"&gt;heat intolerance&lt;/a&gt; due to how they affect the body’s ability to sweat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both these antidepressants are believed to partly work by affecting neurotransmitter levels in the brain – primarily serotonin and noradrenaline. However, they may also affect other neurotransmitters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, TCAs can &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/364738"&gt;block acetylcholine&lt;/a&gt;, a neurotransmitter important for sweating. This may cause some patients to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18217788/#:%7E:text=Drugs%20that%20induce%20hyperhidrosis%2C%20or%20sweating%20in,agents%2C%20carbonic%20anhydrase%20inhibitors%20and%20tricyclic%20antidepressants."&gt;sweat less&lt;/a&gt;. On a hot day, this could make it hard to cool down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, TCAs also increase noradrenaline levels, a neurotransmitter that stimulates sweat glands. This can increase sweating. In fact, both SSRIs and TCAs can increase sweating in users. Data shows &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00002018-200831020-00002"&gt;up to 14%&lt;/a&gt; of antidepressant users experience this side-effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SSRIs may also &lt;a href="https://inpharmd.com/inquiries/64a766649747a03e8bc259f52bf4b1d3bc10af53c994d252534aa6a6ef3b47e0"&gt;interfere with the hypothalamus&lt;/a&gt; – the brain region that controls body temperature and tells the sweat glands to start producing sweat. But this signal may be affected by the increased serotonin levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since sweating is a key cooling mechanism, any disruptions to this process can lead to heat-related illness. Excess sweating may also &lt;a href="https://www.sweathelp.org/home/preventing-dehydration.html"&gt;cause dehydration&lt;/a&gt; if fluids aren’t replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Antipsychotics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antipsychotics are used to treat psychosis, which can occur in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. They do this by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8509109"&gt;blocking the neurotransmitter dopamine&lt;/a&gt; – which in turn affects levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin. This can disrupt the hypothalamus’s ability to sense and respond to body temperature changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, someone taking an antipsychotic might not feel overheated or thirsty when it’s hot out. This can cause &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8509109/"&gt;low blood pressure and reduced heart function&lt;/a&gt;. The body then tries to compensate by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8509109/"&gt;narrowing the blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; and holding in heat. This in turn reduces sweating and makes it harder to cool down properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, antipsychotics have &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00228-019-02763-5"&gt;anticholinergic properties&lt;/a&gt;. This means they block the action of acetylcholine, making it harder to sweat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Heart medications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta-blockers are used to manage heart failure and arrhythmias. They do this by lowering heart rate and reducing how forcefully the heart pumps. But this can &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcpt.12294?saml_referrer"&gt;limit blood flow&lt;/a&gt; to the skin – making it harder for the body to release heat on hot days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diuretics are also commonly used in the treatment of high blood pressure or heart failure. But as these drugs &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557838/"&gt;increase urine output&lt;/a&gt;, this may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances during hot weather. With less fluid available, the body may struggle to sweat properly. If you become &lt;a href="https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/hormonal-and-metabolic-disorders/water-balance/dehydration#Symptoms_v770569"&gt;severely dehydrated&lt;/a&gt;, you might actually stop feeling thirsty.  Blood pressure can also drop, which may cause dizziness or fainting – especially when standing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Various heart medications can increase risk of dehydration in hot weather.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/active-senior-man-exhausted-tired-resting-2399009235"&gt;pics five/ Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramipril and losartan, also used to manage blood pressure, can &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1527-5299.2001.00274.x"&gt;increase the risk of dehydration&lt;/a&gt; as well. These drugs block a system in the body that helps control blood pressure, fluid balance and thirst. This may reduce your natural urge to drink, increasing dehydration risk when it’s hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Stimulants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stimulants – such as the amphetamines used for ADHD – affect many brain chemicals, including dopamine and noradrenaline. This can increase body temperature, boost metabolism and change how the body sweats – all of which can &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1509385/full"&gt;make it harder to cool down&lt;/a&gt;, especially when exercising or in hot weather. This can also potentially lead to dehydration, overheating or even heatstroke. Stimulants may also reduce the feeling of tiredness, which can cause people to overexert themselves without realising the danger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1509385/full"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; shows people with ADHD who take stimulants may actually have a lower chance of heat-related illnesses – but larger trials are needed to investigate further. The researchers hypothesise that this protective effect may be due to factors such as lower body weight and users staying hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Insulin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warm temperatures cause the body’s blood vessels to dilate (widen) in order to help us cool off. But this action means insulin is &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-and-hot-weather.html"&gt;absorbed into the bloodstream faster&lt;/a&gt; as there’s enhanced blood flow to the area where insulin is injected – making blood sugar drop more quickly. This can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/low-blood-sugar-hypoglycaemia"&gt;hypoglycemia&lt;/a&gt; (low blood glucose level), which may lead to dizziness, shaking, sweating, irritability and even potentially loss of consciousness or seizures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faster insulin absorption can also make it harder for people with diabetes to notice signs of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/low-blood-sugar-hypoglycaemia/"&gt;low blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; in the heat, since common symptoms may be mistaken for being hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heat can also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1079525/"&gt;degrade insulin&lt;/a&gt;, reducing its effectiveness and making it unsafe. This is why insulin should be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37930742"&gt;stored in the fridge&lt;/a&gt; until use – especially in summer. Damaged insulin will &lt;a href="https://wchh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/pdi.1960020414"&gt;change appearance&lt;/a&gt; – turning cloudy or changing colour. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Avoiding heatstroke&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6098859/"&gt;Older adults&lt;/a&gt;, people with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4131963/"&gt;chronic conditions&lt;/a&gt; (especially those with heart or lung disease) and those taking &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4131963/"&gt;multiple prescription drugs&lt;/a&gt; are especially vulnerable to heat-related illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are &lt;a href="https://www.acutemedicine.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/SAM-Hot-Weather-Health-Plan-2025.pdf"&gt;steps you can take&lt;/a&gt; to stay safe during summer if you’re taking one of these common prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, check labels for storage instructions. Avoid leaving medications in hot places, such as in cars or on windowsills. Insulin isn’t the only drug affected by heat – &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a681050.html#:%7E:text=Tell%20your%20doctor%20if%20your,doing%20it%20the%20right%20way."&gt;inhalers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25997362/"&gt;EpiPens&lt;/a&gt; can also malfunction or become less effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, stay hydrated when it’s hot – unless your doctor has advised otherwise. Dehydration can actually worsen the effects of many medicines. For example, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11932-002-0011-0"&gt;anti-inflammatory painkillers&lt;/a&gt; (such as ibuprofen) are more likely to cause kidney problems and bipolar medicines (including &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499992/"&gt;lithium&lt;/a&gt;) can become toxic if you’re dehydrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/hottest-part-of-the-day-what-time-temperature-highest-uk-why-peak-1748237?srsltid=AfmBOorOUvbFO1QXy0iBR_4ex9GLQq1xUFHc83fmQZVDHp2uCDQvxS0_"&gt;peak heat hours&lt;/a&gt; and stay in cool environments when possible. Watch for &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/supporting-vulnerable-people-before-and-during-hot-weather-healthcare-professionals#who-is-at-risk"&gt;warning signs&lt;/a&gt; of heat-related illness – such as dizziness, confusion, nausea or excessive sweating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, don’t stop taking your prescriptions medication without medical advice. If it’s affecting your ability to cope with the heat, speak with your doctor or pharmacist.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Painful sex. Urinary leakage. Constipation. Weak orgasms. What do these unpleasant experiences have in common?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They can all be symptoms of a pelvic floor dysfunction in women, says &lt;a href="https://thevagwhisperer.com/about/" target="_blank"&gt;Sara Reardon&lt;/a&gt;, a pelvic floor physical therapist who has been in the field for nearly two decades. She is the author of &lt;a href="https://thevagwhisperer.com/floored/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Floored: A Woman's Guide to Pelvic Floor Health at Every Age and Stage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published in June.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22729-pelvic-floor-muscles" target="_blank"&gt;pelvic floor&lt;/a&gt; is a basket of muscles that sits at the bottom of your pelvis and has an important role, Reardon says&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; It supports organs like your bladder, bowels and reproductive system. It also works with your abdominal muscles to support your spine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But for as much as we use our pelvic floor, "many of us don't know these muscles exist," she says. "Therefore, if a problem arises, [we don't know] how to evaluate it and get treatment for it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One in three women will experience a pelvic floor disorder in her lifetime, &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1586/17474108.4.2.165" target="_blank"&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;including young women and postmenopausal women who have never given birth, Reardon says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pelvic floor physical therapy, such as certain exercises and stretches, can be an effective way to address some of these issues, she says. Studies have shown it can &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e7d4fB8KNrh-5VaoeHBcpeOLdc6OoSXy/view" target="_blank"&gt;improve bowel and bladder control, make sex more enjoyable, decrease lower back pain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fRuCAtw8_G2srV5SaTVkyuxxZVvqxcur/view" target="_blank"&gt;improve postpartum recovery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Reardon talked to Life Kit about what people with vaginas should know about their pelvic floor and what to do if you have pelvic floor pain. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some facts from the book that I think people might find surprising: Orgasms are pelvic floor &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33258326/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;muscle contractions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yes, those muscles are the ones that contract and relax during an orgasm, and so if you have a pelvic floor muscle issue, it could cause the &lt;a href="https://share.upmc.com/2022/01/sexual-dysfunction/" target="_blank"&gt;inability to orgasm&lt;/a&gt;, pain with orgasms and weak orgasms.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing out your pee is not great for you.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yeah. Just say no to &lt;a href="https://nafc.org/bhealth-blog/why-you-shouldnt-push-when-you-pee/" target="_blank"&gt;power peeing&lt;/a&gt;. You want to sit, relax and let it flow. Relaxing your pelvic floor allows your bladder, which is a muscle, to push the urine out, and that's really how you're supposed to pee. Sit instead of hovering, breathe and chill, and then your bladder muscle contracts.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tense pelvic floor muscles can cause constipation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Correct.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let's talk about some of the symptoms that can indicate pelvic floor dysfunction. What are common signs you might have pelvic floor tension or tightness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Your muscles have to relax fully to empty your bowels. If they're not relaxing because they're overly tight or tense, you can have straining with bowel movements, hemorrhoids, fissures, incomplete emptying and even feeling like your stools are really thin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tightness can also lead to having a hard time starting your urine stream. You may feel like your bladder isn't emptying completely.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another common symptom is painful intercourse. It can feel like something can't enter the vagina. You may also feel that with inserting tampons or during pelvic examinations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can you do to prevent or address pelvic floor tension?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Watch your posture. A lot of us sit too much throughout the day. Vary your movements. If you are sitting, keep your feet flat or cross at the ankles. Also, unclench your butt.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Take some big, deep breaths throughout the day to soften your pelvic floor muscles; then work on stretching with a deep squat or yoga poses like child's pose or happy baby pose.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are also devices you can use at home for internal massage to the muscles, such as a &lt;a href="https://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/postpartum-health-and-care/pelvic-wand#definition" target="_blank"&gt;therapy wand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/patient-education/how-use-vaginal-dilator" target="_blank"&gt;vaginal dilators&lt;/a&gt; to help relax the muscles internally.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other sign of pelvic floor dysfunction is weakness. What does that look like in the body?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some of the things we commonly see are urinary leakage when coughing, sneezing, running and jumping.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Another is pelvic organ prolapse, where the pelvic organs aren't as supported by that hammock of muscles as we'd like them to be, so they start to drop or push into the vaginal canal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you feel less sensation with intercourse or urinate during intercourse or orgasms, those can be other signs of weak pelvic floor muscles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we strengthen our pelvic floor muscles? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Work on pelvic floor strengthening exercises. Do quick Kegel contractions and longer-hold five- or 10-second Kegel contractions in different positions and during exercises like lunges and squats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tighten those muscles before activities that cause leakage. I always say, "Kegel before you cough," or "Squeeze before you sneeze."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The biggest thing is to stop straining [when you go to the bathroom], because that can weaken your pelvic floor over time. For bowel movements, I recommend using a stool under your feet to put you in the squatting position [and make it easier to go].&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are having these symptoms, what should you do? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In every state in the United States, you can access a pelvic floor therapist for an evaluation without a referral from a physician.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Your insurance may require [a referral], but you can at least have an evaluation, and they can tell you whether you have a pelvic floor muscle issue and connect you with a medical provider who can see you and/or write a prescription to continue treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you have common signs of infection of the urinary tract or the vagina, your first stop should be checking with a medical provider and getting things [like a urinary tract infection or a yeast infection] ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should you look for in a pelvic floor physical therapist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They should be trained and qualified to do a pelvic floor muscle internal assessment to evaluate the pelvic floor muscles. They should not just hook you up to devices like Kegel or electric stimulation machines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The treatment should be a combination of exercise, manual therapy and education. They should also give you things at home to work on so you can do some self-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;You want to look for somebody with training and compassion who is a really good listener. We're talking about vulnerable and intimate issues, and if you don't feel comfortable having these conversations and talking about your symptoms with your therapist, I would find a new therapist.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="hr"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was edited by Malaka Gharib.

which are also licensed for type 2 diabetes - are being asked to report the detail on the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Yellow Card website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They will then be asked if they would be willing to take part in the study, which will check whether some people are at a higher genetic risk of acute pancreatitis when taking these medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Patients will be asked to submit more information and a saliva sample, with the overall aim of reducing the occurrence of the side effects in future, says the MHRA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Cases recorded on the Yellow Card website up until 13 May this year include 10 in which patients, who were using weight loss drugs, died from the effects of pancreatitis - but it is not clear whether other factors also played a part.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is impossible to know exactly how many people in the UK are on weight loss drugs as many users obtain them online through unregulated sources, rather than through their doctors.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health officials have suggested the jabs could help turn the tide on obesity. However, they have also warned the drugs are not a silver bullet and often come with side effects, commonly including nausea, constipation and diarrhoea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And the MHRA has also warned that &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn0gp2pl7zwo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Mounjaro could make the oral contraceptive pill less effective for some patients.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Alison Cave, the MHRA's chief safety officer said information from the study "will help us to better predict those most at risk of adverse reactions, enabling patients across the UK to receive the safest medicine for them, based on their genetic make-up". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She said evidence showed almost a third of side effects to medicines could be prevented with genetic testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It is predicted that adverse drug reactions could cost the NHS more than £2.2bn a year in hospital stays alone," she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Matt Brown, chief scientific officer at Genomics England, said: "GLP-1 medicines like Ozempic and Wegovy have been making headlines, but like all medicines there can be a risk of serious side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We believe there is real potential to minimise these, with many adverse reactions having a genetic cause."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He said the next step would be to "generate data and evidence for safer and more effective treatment through more personalised approaches to prescription, supporting a shift towards an increasingly prevention-focused healthcare system".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 12:11:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5TRDJSS3NDNXF5eWs5WldJMWdaT2JGeXk5dF82MFhPNC0zc1J6Rlg1Skg4X2xmSUw5ZTVES2JjbF92WVlWYmFxQm93OUJtYU05ajdRMjk0TlpMQdIBX0FVX3lxTFBhd1FFZmFBdnA1cF91R2R4TWlXWlh4ODV6aEVhbl9YLXBnVEJBb2QzaVd3RGJxbS1sNHBPV2JnbDdfaXJqdEFMTWlsYjlxSFE3dDRYRkxidlVsZXZ2ODFJ</guid></item><item><title>新设备可节省面临5-器官故障的儿童-新闻 | New Device Saves Child Facing 5-Organ Failure - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPVGQzRzVBOV9DOUFVNUMzNmhoNW54U1BSTDVMMzF2Sm1PM3VIb05tdV9CeXZDYlRSZnNiR3ZmQ2pzdlBhU1RRZ1hPMWhaY05TVU0yMUlZMi1PVkd6bHZySFAxNTk4d05UM19NUzJmSTB6aEgtdU9saTRvZ3RqQ2VUdWZMbV9YWVBtMmg2TjltOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;

                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Doctors at &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/first-its-kind-therapeutic-device-saves-child-septic-shock-multiorgan-failure"&gt;Michigan Medicine&lt;/a&gt; have reported a medical first: saving a young child in septic shock and experiencing failure of five organ systems using a new device called the &lt;a href="https://seastarmedical.com/our-solution/"&gt;Selective Cytopheretic Device&lt;/a&gt; (SCD), made by SeaStar Medical. The case, published in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s00467-025-06798-y?sharing_token=WnP7-NrIdDOCNleHt5EDLPe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY4KveRkO_RYeE3zwjJAap1foVBxYOb3zsIK2Tu88UMy-e3941qjfjCJgZqPUQXEyeZdZcgNbkh9O_5VDRR98zQ_K0au4Q6Nrphe-0ksMTaXAPtse7jSUIHr5ntJ9Laa1_E%3D"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pediatric Nephrology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, involved a child with a prior kidney transplant who'd recently started chemotherapy for B-cell leukemia. When the child ended up in the hospital with a severe infection, doctors estimated a 5% chance of survival.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Conventional treatments didn't seem to be the way forward, so the team opted to try the SCD, a device developed at the University of Michigan over two decades. The SCD, which is now FDA-approved for certain uses, works by filtering the patient's blood outside the body. It temporarily modifies white blood cells to reduce the excessive inflammatory response that can damage organs during severe infections like sepsis.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        There was concern about using the device, as the child's white blood cell count was unusually low due to chemotherapy, raising the risk of worsening the infection. However, after emergency approval, the device was used. The intervention improved blood cell counts and restored kidney and liver function, all without significant side effects. The child was eventually taken off mechanical ventilation and, after 38 days in intensive care, transferred to a general hospital ward. The patient has since returned home, is off dialysis, and is reportedly cancer-free.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                
                                
                                
                                    &lt;center&gt;
                                        &lt;p id="divStoryContinues"&gt;story continues below&lt;/p&gt;
                                        
                                    &lt;/center&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        "The SCD therapy won't just stop the storm but could potentially reverse the damage," notes the &lt;a href="https://seastarmedical.com/our-solution/"&gt;SeaStar website&lt;/a&gt;. The success in this case has led to wider adoption at other pediatric centers. One caveat: The research came from the National Institutes of Health and private philanthropy, with some researchers holding financial interests in companies associated with the technology.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

He was shocked to discover he was 8 pounds heavier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6b5da4" class="body-graf"&gt;“I was a mess. I was so upset. That’s when it forced me to get the 8 pounds off,” Eisenberg, who is also an associate professor of medicine at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/cardiologist-heart-healthy-habits-rcna138372" target="_blank"&gt;previously told TODAY.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-acd8d2" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/weight-loss-after-40-rcna117617" target="_blank"&gt;Weight creep&lt;/a&gt; — or gradual weight gain year after year — is common as people age. But even modest weight gain between early adulthood and middle age &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/gaining-just-5-22-pounds-age-55-can-hurt-your-t114042" target="_blank"&gt;can hurt health&lt;/a&gt;, raising the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity-related cancer and dying early, studies have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-45b215" class="body-graf"&gt;So Eisenberg devised a sustainable weight-loss plan that’s helped him keep calories in check and avoid feeling deprived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-512784" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardiologist Tip of the Day: Try the 'Work Diet'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-442c8c" class="body-graf"&gt;Eisenberg keeps his weight stable by following what he calls “the work diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4663d2" class="body-graf"&gt;The rules are simple: He eats as nutritiously as possible during his work hours Monday through Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6cfa02" class="body-graf"&gt;For him, that means combining breakfast and lunch, a type of &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/how-lose-weight-intermittent-fasting-16-8-diet-t132608" target="_blank"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt;, and waiting until 11 a.m. to have a protein-rich snack, such as a Greek yogurt, a scoop of tuna fish or a hard-boiled egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e268f1" class="body-graf"&gt;If someone in the office brings donuts, pizza or Chinese food, he skips it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-568137" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-501562" class="body-graf"&gt;Most people spend at least half of their waking hours at work.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="nimbus-covid-symptoms-sore-throat"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What are the symptoms of the new Nimbus COVID-19 variant?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong confirmed that no surprising wild card symptoms have yet been reported for NB.1.8.1 — they’re the same COVID-19 symptoms you’re used to hearing about from previous variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the one symptom that doctors are hearing about from patients is the very painful throat that’s &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid19-sore-throat-razor-blade-vaccine-4688df53917022cb61204e08b41d5952"&gt;earned the unfortunate nickname “razor blade throat.”&lt;/a&gt; Or &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/1ldvned/new_razor_blade_throat_covid_subvariant_quickly/"&gt;as Reddit commenters have described it&lt;/a&gt;, “like being burned by acid whenever I ate or drank something” and “like my throat was coated in broken glass.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is Nimbus, a descendent of the omicron variant that first emerged in 2021, causing such sore throats? “I think omicron in general prioritizes the upper respiratory tract instead of the getting into the lungs as much,” Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8989396/"&gt;One 2022 study from the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; found that a higher proportion of patients — up to 70% of those studied — reported sore throats when infected with the the omicron variant compared with earlier variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with previous variants to reach the Bay Area, Chin-Hong noted that more people also now appear to experience non-respiratory symptoms like diarrhea, nausea and vomiting when they get COVID-19 — gastrointestinal symptoms that folks can often initially dismiss as being unrelated to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/"&gt;this is the full list of the possible symptoms of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fever or chills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle or body aches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New loss of taste or smell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sore throat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congestion or runny nose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nausea or vomiting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you might have a combination of these symptoms or just one. They might be mild or feel more severe. But if you’re experiencing any of these, take a COVID-19 test (more on this below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="nimbus-razor-blade-throat-medicine-remedy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;OK, so how can I soothe my ‘razor blade throat’ if I’m infected?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this kind of severe sore throat, it might be tempting to focus on topical medicine for your throat itself. But in general, systemic therapies — treatments which enter through your bloodstream, like Advil, and affect your whole body — “are better than topical ones,” said Chin-Hong. His recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ibuprofen and acetaminophen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen (like Advil) is better than acetaminophen (like Tylenol) in this case, he said, although you should check with your health provider if you have other medical conditions which might make taking ibuprofen. If your throat hurts too much to swallow a pill, you can consider liquid versions of these drugs, but make sure you use the right dose depending on age, said Chin-Hong.  And if you’re using a combination cold remedy like Nyquil, be aware it might already  contain ibuprofen or acetaminophen — and be careful not to accidentally double-dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic remedies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could try warm remedies like chicken soup, broth, lemon tea, honey or cold ones like popsicles, ice cream or ice chips. The upside of these treatments is the immediate relief they can bring, but they might also not last as long. You could also try gargling salt water,  “which may loosen mucus” said Chin-Hong, or sucking lozenges with menthol or a mild anesthetic like benzocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental treatments to try &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong also recommends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get your rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t smoke or expose yourself to smoke&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider a humidifier, as dryness may make your symptoms worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you should consider seeking medical attention if your symptoms last longer than a week, if your sore throat is very severe, and if you begin drooling or become unable to eat or drink, said Chin-Hong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="covidcasesbayarea"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What are the current COVID-19 cases in the Bay Area right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual “COVID cases” — that is, positive test results — are not tracked in the way they once were by local and state public health bodies. In the absence of widespread up-to-date data on positive test results, watching for the presence of the coronavirus in human sewage has become increasingly important for gauging the levels of COVID-19 spread in a particular area. This is because if you have COVID-19, &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/1963120/one-way-to-monitor-a-communitys-coronavirus-infections-raw-sewage"&gt;the virus will show up in your feces &lt;/a&gt;soon after you’re infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While COVID-19 levels in the Bay Area’s wastewater have been slowly increasing since late spring, there’s “no statistically significant trend upwards at the moment,” said Bidwell from WastewaterSCAN. The Bay Area’s wastewater sites that Stanford monitors are currently in the “medium” category, she said, and “concentrations are on average lower where they were this time last year,” when &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11987343/covid-bay-area-wastewater-variant-symptoms-isolation-guidance"&gt;the Bay Area experienced a summer surge.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="nimbus-variants-vaccines-work"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Is the latest COVID-19 vaccine still effective against the new variant?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes: &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/12001396/where-can-i-get-new-covid-vaccine-near-me-2024"&gt;The COVID-19 vaccine that rolled out in August 2024 &lt;/a&gt;is effective against the NB.1.8.1 variant, said Chin-Hong. “It’s a descendant of JN.1, which all the last year’s vaccines were based on, which we still have around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/12001396/where-can-i-get-new-covid-vaccine-near-me-2024"&gt;get your COVID-19 shot in the fall, Chin-Hong has a message&lt;/a&gt;: Go get one now, particularly if you plan to traveling abroad this summer. Not only will your protection last roughly a year, he said, “getting it now if it’s being paid for would help that person navigate through what we might see in the summer, but also later on in the year if rules change” — referring to the widespread uncertainty about &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-fda-kennedy-covid-shots-rfk-trump-bb4de15b6ff955d6cd0b406aaec3cdc5"&gt;how President Donald Trump’s administration might further change the U.S.’s vaccine policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html"&gt;Currently, the CDC recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for most adults 18 and older&lt;/a&gt;, which means that most health insurance companies should cover the costs for people will insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="covid-incubationperiod-2025"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I think I was exposed, or have symptoms. When should I take a COVID-19 test?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Know about updated incubation times for NB.1.8.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve heard that incubation times for the virus are getting shorter — that is, the amount of time between getting exposed to COVID-19 and testing positive — it’s true. People are testing positive more quickly than they were in 2020, when the average incubation period was five to seven days, because it has changed with each new variant, said Chin-Hong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days is a common period of time between exposure and getting sick, said Chin-Hong, and given this trend it makes sense to take a COVID-19 test as early as two days after exposure if you’re already having symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="covid-incubation-period"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Don’t trust a negative early COVID-19 test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your first test is negative, you should absolutely test again the next day if symptoms persist — and again after that if you’re still negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s why you can’t necessarily trust a negative at-home COVID-19 test in 2025: While incubation times have gotten shorter, doctors are seeing people take longer to get a positive test, Chin-Hong said, and that’s probably more to do with how much quicker someone with COVID-19 might develop &lt;em&gt;symptoms&lt;/em&gt; in 2025 than they would have done in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, those symptoms are the sign that your body’s immune system is mounting a response to an invading virus. Back at the start of the pandemic, by the time you developed COVID-19 symptoms and took a test, it would probably already be positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at this stage of the pandemic, “we likely have more immune cells circulating that can recognize the enemy, so it ‘sounds the alarm’ quicker [and] people might feel something faster than in the old days,” said Chin-Hong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease physician and researcher at Stanford University, also put it this way for NPR in 2024: “With our immune systems primed, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2024/01/07/1222847727/coronavirus-faq-my-partner-roommate-kid-got-covid-and-i-didnt-how-come"&gt;the body’s response [now] comes much more quickly than it would have back in 2020&lt;/a&gt; when SARS-CoV-2 was a novel pathogen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because many of us take a COVID-19 test when we &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; to feel sick, we might actually be testing way too early for an at-home antigen kit to successfully detect enough virus inside us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: If you’re testing because you’ve started feeling unwell, don’t assume a negative result means you don’t actually have COVID-19. Play it safe, stay home as much as you can and wear a well-fitted mask if you can’t. Take another antigen test 48 hours later, Chin-Hong said. You can also seek out a PCR test, which are more sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Make sure your COVID-19 test hasn’t expired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those COVID-19 tests you might have in a drawer may be approaching their expiration date if they haven’t already passed it. And an expired test could give you an unreliable result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests#list"&gt;You can check the FDA’s list of antigen test types &lt;/a&gt;to see &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests#list"&gt;whether the box you’re holding has had its shelf life extended&lt;/a&gt; by the manufacturer. The FDA said that if a test’s shelf life has been extended, it’s because the manufacturer has given the agency enough “data showing that the shelf-life is longer than was known when the test was first authorized.” (In other words, it’s still OK to use that test.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tip from Chin-Hong: “A quick and dirty way” to know if you’re using a functional COVID-19 test is to make sure the control line turns positive. If that doesn’t happen, “that means the test is probably not working,” he warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="freecovidtests"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Where can I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; find a free COVID-19 test?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a quick, free COVID-19 test — whether an at-home antigen test or a PCR test — has gotten progressively harder at this stage of the pandemic as more sites and services have been shuttered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And visiting &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/"&gt;the White House site that once offered you free at-home COVID-tests&lt;/a&gt; through USPS will now greet you with an image of Trump superimposed over the headline “LAB LEAK: The True Origins of COVID-19,” as well as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/18/g-s1-61324/lab-leak-white-house-covid-origins"&gt;a page dedicated to the theory disputed by many scientists&lt;/a&gt; that the pandemic was caused by the coronavirus leaking from a government laboratory in Wuhan, China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_11957645" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-11957645" src="https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/08/RS47065_033_SanJose_COVIDTesting_02032021-KQED.jpg" alt="A person with long hair inserts a long cottonswab in her nostril while standing in the doorway of her home." srcset="https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/08/RS47065_033_SanJose_COVIDTesting_02032021-KQED.jpg 2000w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/08/RS47065_033_SanJose_COVIDTesting_02032021-KQED-800x533.jpg 800w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/08/RS47065_033_SanJose_COVIDTesting_02032021-KQED-1020x680.jpg 1020w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/08/RS47065_033_SanJose_COVIDTesting_02032021-KQED-160x107.jpg 160w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/08/RS47065_033_SanJose_COVIDTesting_02032021-KQED-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/08/RS47065_033_SanJose_COVIDTesting_02032021-KQED-1920x1280.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Janet Franco-Orona swabs her nose for a COVID-19 test at her home in San José on Feb. 3, 2021. &lt;cite&gt;(Beth LaBerge/KQED)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you do now if you don’t already have a supply of antigen tests for COVID-19 at home right now? Try the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Purchase a COVID-19 at-home antigen test at a pharmacy near you&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quickest option will also be one of the most expensive up-front: Purchasing an at-home antigen test at a nearby pharmacy. (Ideally, ask someone to purchase one for you so you don’t potentially expose other people at the pharmacy, and if you really have to go yourself, wear a well-fitted N95 mask to help lower the risk you pose to others.) These at-home test kits are usually around $20 for a pack of two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have health insurance, you can &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11969300/how-to-get-reimbursed-for-at-home-covid-tests-in-2023"&gt;request reimbursement from your health insurer for the cost of up to eight at-home tests per month&lt;/a&gt;, so don’t throw away your receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Find a COVID-19 PCR testing site near you&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCR testing is more accurate than an antigen test. It’s more sensitive at picking up traces of the coronavirus in your body, but it may take longer to get your results than with an at-home test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are still some sites offering free COVID-19 testing around the state. Try visiting &lt;a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/testing.html"&gt;MyTurn.ca.gov/testing&lt;/a&gt; and applying the “Free Sites” filter from the drop-down menu. You can also find&lt;a href="https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/"&gt; a health center near you &lt;/a&gt;and ask if they offer COVID-19 testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://testinglocator.cdc.gov/Search"&gt;The CDC’s COVID-19 test locator&lt;/a&gt; is no longer operational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have health insurance, you may be able to get a PCR test ordered by your health care provider with the costs covered. Having a test ordered by a provider is — usually — the only way to get your testing costs covered if you have Medicare, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;If you have health insurance, contact your provider&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re insured through major Bay Area providers like Kaiser Permanente or Sutter Health, the easiest way to get a COVID-19 test may be to make an appointment through your provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most providers offer sign-ups online through a member login and appointments can also be made by phone.&lt;/p&gt;

I’d started to feel discomfort right before I knew he was going to finish, and I knew immediately what that meant — a couple of days of pain, exacerbated by a neurological condition I suffer from — but I’d long been conditioned to ignore pain if it benefits men. I wanted this new guy to feel good, too. He left shortly after we finished. I didn’t want to be alone, but the “rules of &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/tiktok-videos-single-women-crying.html"&gt;modern dating&lt;/a&gt;” often interfere with what I need as a &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/06/choosing-celibacy-as-survival.html"&gt;trauma survivor&lt;/a&gt;. That happens a lot; all of the “shoulds” around relationships and sex we’re supposed to care about, like being likable or focusing our lives on finding a partner, go out the window when compared to the impact of trauma. Since most people I’ve dated or slept with aren’t following the trauma survivor rules, though, I often try to appear normal, chill, like somebody who would be easier to be with than maybe I actually am.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7xz7001l3b774j3v0j2c@published" data-word-count="86"&gt;The guy I was sleeping with knew about my trauma history, and I had asked him to check in with me if we slept together, telling him it made me feel safer. Whether or not a partner is understanding of how trauma affects me can mean the difference between &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/sex-sabbatical-husband-marriage.html"&gt;a positive sex life&lt;/a&gt; and total incompatibility. Sometimes it’s harder for me to explain the link between pain that wasn’t caused by violence and a trauma response. If something was an accident, why should it bother me?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7y14001m3b77q6gcrbax@published" data-word-count="105"&gt;Sitting on the cold kitchen floor, I kept glancing over at my phone, hoping he would text me to ask how I was doing. I had been in an abusive relationship during which I was punished for being in discomfort and “inconveniencing” that partner, and I was still afraid to bring up pain. I felt more comfortable sharing that I was in pain if explicitly asked. My phone vibrated on the ground next to me, and I felt a wave of relief wash over me. I picked up my phone, opened his text, and froze. He wasn’t checking in on me; he was ending things.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7y3r001n3b77tq3vffie@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;In the days that followed, I was upset about the end of a potential relationship, the loss of somebody I had enjoyed being around. But I wasn’t able to articulate the part that felt the worst, the most tender wound: how vulnerable I felt, in pain from sex with a person who failed to recognize my needs despite how clearly I communicated them. I was on the floor with nobody to help me up — literally.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7y5h001o3b77iucmlt1f@published" data-word-count="77"&gt;Experiencing pain related to sex may feel familiar to sexual-assault survivors. However pain manifests, and regardless of whether it was caused directly by sexual activity, it can be a trigger, cause isolation, and fracture otherwise positive relationships if communication breaks down. Sometimes, our bodies register pain from consensual sex as threatening, and we become afraid of our own bodies. Physical pain can cause a second wave of emotional pain that may become even more difficult to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7y7h001p3b779v71t13t@published" data-word-count="77"&gt;One survivor I spoke with described that when she felt pain, no matter how slight, during sex, it became intolerable. I’ve heard from many survivors with similar stories: Newly aware of pain during sex, they began experiencing more pain than before their assaults. Another survivor explained that experiencing intense physical pain during her assault meant pain during sex was a deal-breaker. Diagnosable disorders like vaginismus affect trauma survivors, but even accidental, one-off painful experiences can be triggering.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7y98001q3b77wi60g8z3@published" data-word-count="157"&gt;For me, pain &lt;em&gt;related&lt;/em&gt; to sex but not necessarily during it can be just as much of a trigger. I experienced medical complications after getting my first IUD, and I spent a night in the emergency room, thinking to myself the whole time: &lt;em&gt;I’m in this much pain because I’d decided to get birth control&lt;/em&gt;. The recovery from that medical experience affected my decisions about sex in the months that followed. I held back. I stopped exercising for months because I was afraid of triggering pain. Any touch from my partner felt threatening because I didn’t know where it would lead — not because he wasn’t trustworthy, but because I didn’t trust my own body. Today, going to the gynecologist or discussing health-care choices related to my sexual health proves triggering without exception. I am sensitive to where doctors’ hands are during exams, even if I have consented to the exam in general. Stray touch is intolerable.&lt;/p&gt;

After sexual assault, more than one therapist recommended I explore my sexuality through masturbation — as a test, before trying on my sexuality around a partner. The few mainstream books that referenced sexual healing post-assault similarly underscored the idea that masturbation is a key step toward sexual recovery and confidence if I ever wanted to seek out sex with another person. Basically, I was inundated with the idea that before I could sleep with somebody else, I had to sleep with myself.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7yee001s3b77zu49f123@published" data-word-count="138"&gt;I have early childhood memories of exploring my body, but at the time I was raped at 18, I did not regularly masturbate. Looking back, I think I was avoiding it because I associated the physical act with an aspect of sexual abuse I experienced as a young kid. My body didn’t feel safe to me in general, and I didn’t respond to sexual stimuli when I was alone as positively as when I got turned on when I was with somebody else. When my therapist suggested I read a book that highlighted masturbation as a key to sexual healing, I nodded along. But I didn’t start masturbating regularly until years later, after I’d broken up with a longtime boyfriend. I got the first vibrator that actually worked for me and spent some time exploring on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

When I was alone, I was in control, and I felt less pressure to go out and date or sleep with anybody else if I could satisfy myself sexually.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7yi0001u3b77puwvaw11@published" data-word-count="42"&gt;Even when I started having casual sex regularly, or later got into relationships, I have continued masturbating. It helps me feel in control of my sex drive, makes me relax and refocus when I’m stressed, and is a reliable source of pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7yms001v3b77mx00i2kc@published" data-word-count="136"&gt;Over the years, I’ve noticed a pattern: My relationship with masturbation has developed independently from my relationship with sex with partners. The two are separate, not sequential. I hope other trauma survivors can avoid the pressure I felt to explore masturbation as a prerequisite to sex with somebody else. Pleasure alone for its own sake is worth pursuing and doesn’t have to be tied to whether we’re ready for sex with a partner. And if you do have a partner, that doesn’t mean you have to abandon pursuing sex solo, whether that’s through masturbating, watching porn, or whatever feels safe and satisfying to you. By honoring your relationship with your own body, you’re actually setting yourself up to have a better relationship with a partner — who hopefully has a strong relationship with their body too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7yom001w3b77oj11m318@published" data-word-count="94"&gt;By exploring alone, some survivors have restructured their approach to sexual pleasure. They focus on sustaining and increasing pleasure rather than reaching orgasm. It’s not that people &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t &lt;/em&gt;orgasm during sex, it’s just that it doesn’t have to be the end goal. (And sometimes, making sex about a goal at all can feel upsetting.) Survivors often carry this philosophy forward into sexual relationships with other people. On the other hand, some survivors told me that centering a sexual experience around orgasm is empowering for them and communicates a clear message: &lt;em&gt;My satisfaction comes first&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmc4w7yqa001x3b77bpyqmy2r@published" data-word-count="71"&gt;But sometimes satisfying is out of reach, like if our fight-or-flight is too high or we’re sleeping with a new person. Many survivors search for a sense of safety beyond anything else — if sex feels safe, it is good, regardless of whether it is satisfying. We get to set our own goals, and if our main or sole goal is safety, that is just as worthwhile as having an orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers identified three broad strategies and 45 distinct ways that people try to break up with their partners. They found that most people try to do so gently, explaining their reasons and hoping for an amicable separation, while only a few disappear abruptly or end the relationship through indirect means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many studies have examined why people break up, few have looked closely at how breakups happen, especially within the context of a specific culture. The researchers aimed to fill this gap by focusing on people in Greece. They also wanted to understand if certain personality traits influenced the strategies people used to end relationships, with a special focus on traits like agreeableness and a set of less well-regarded characteristics known as the Dark Triad: psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people will experience the end of an intimate relationship (usually several times), with either themselves or their partners initiating it. Because this phenomenon is relatively common and painful, I was motivated to ask how people actually do so, which the current research aimed to address,” said study author &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/site/menelaosapostolou/Menelaos-Apostolou" target="_blank"&gt;Menelaos Apostolou&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of Nicosia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted two studies. In the first, 228 Greek-speaking adults (122 women and 105 men) were asked to imagine themselves in an unhappy relationship and write down how they would end it. The participants came from a range of ages, averaging about 30 years old for women and 31 years old for men. The researchers then reviewed the participants’ responses, grouped similar answers together, and ended up with 45 distinct ways people might break up with a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study involved 392 participants (185 women, 201 men, two identifying as ‘other’, and four choosing not to specify) with an average age of roughly 34 for women and 38 for men. These participants were asked how likely they were to use each of the 45 breakup methods. To measure their personalities, participants also completed questionnaires assessing traits associated with the Big Five theory — openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism — as well as Dark Triad traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers grouped the 45 breakup methods into nine strategies. These included approaches like “cold and distant” (gradually pulling away), “explain the reasons” (offering a direct and honest conversation), “ghosting” (disappearing with no notice), “take the blame” (ending the relationship while accepting responsibility), “have been unfaithful” (citing infidelity or interest in someone else), “take some time off” (requesting a break), “see you as a friend” (offering friendship), “we’d be better off apart” (explaining that separation is best), and “avoid ending it face to face” (using a phone call or text).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then discovered that these nine approaches fit into three broader strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first and most popular approach was “soften the blow,” used by roughly 86 percent of people surveyed. This method combined acts like explaining the reasons for the breakup, accepting some or all of the blame, and trying to convince the partner that separating would benefit both people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second approach was “take a break,” used by about 24 percent of people. Here, the person ending the relationship suggests a temporary separation, allowing both parties to assess their feelings and decide if the relationship should continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The least common approach was “avoid confrontation,” used by roughly 16 percent of people, in which someone disappears or becomes distant until the relationship quietly ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People employ three main strategies to end an intimate relationship,” Apostolou told PsyPost. “The most preferred one is ‘Soften the blow,’ involving explaining the breakup reasons, taking responsibility, and convincing the partner that separation is beneficial for both. The second most preferred one is ‘Take a break,’ where individuals express a desire for a temporary separation to reassess feelings. ‘Avoid confrontation,’ involving gradually fading away or disappearing without explanation, is the least preferred strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined how these strategies connected to the participants’ personality traits. They found only a few significant connections. Individuals higher in agreeableness, a trait associated with kindness and consideration for others, were less likely to use the “cold and distant” approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, those with higher levels of Machiavellianism, associated with manipulativeness, were more inclined to use this approach. Meanwhile, participants with higher levels of psychopathy, a trait linked with impulsivity and a lack of empathy, were more prone to blame their partner for the breakup. In general, personality characteristics had little bearing on which strategies people used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded that, regardless of sex, age, or most personality traits, people tend to adopt fairly predictable ways of ending relationships. “I was expecting to find more pronounced sex, age, and personality differences in people’s willingness to use each of the identified strategies, but these differences were very small or inexistent,” Apostolou said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also hint at the role of social norms and evolved behavior. Humans have long depended on intimate connections for survival and reproduction, making breakups potentially dangerous in the ancestral environment. By employing strategies that reduce conflict, individuals might have improved their long-term prospects for finding a new partner and maintaining their social reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study provides a thorough examination of how people end relationships, it has some limitations. All the participants were Greek-speaking, making it unclear if these findings apply to other cultures. The data also came from self-reports, which can be influenced by memory or a desire to present oneself in a certain way. The sample was recruited online, making it challenging to generalize the results to the wider population. Additionally, the study only focused on how people say they would end relationships, not what they actually do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The phenomenon is complex,” Apostolou noted. “A single piece of research gives only a general idea about how people end an intimate relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could investigate how these strategies work in practice and whether certain approaches lead to better outcomes for both partners. It might also be worth exploring how other factors, such as attachment styles or cultural background, shape the ways people end relationships. Understanding these dynamics could help counselors and therapists guide clients through breakups in ways that minimize harm, especially when children are involved or when future interaction is unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My ultimate objective is to understand how intimate relationships work,” Apostolou explained. “An important step in this direction is to understand the interactions between intimate partners, and the present research falls within this objective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2025.113273" target="_blank"&gt;Soften the blow, avoid confrontation, take a break: Three strategies that people use to terminate an intimate relationship&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Menelaos Apostolou and Antonios Kagialis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 10:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQT1pYVzcxTHg0c1p0NXdTek9QNXltaXBQeXJZQmRncWthTTZ2VHAtTzFKNzl6R0pIVUdKTjFkZGtYaFgyWm5yVTZyQTFiazdTUl9oWUt2REVGRVphNHhDcks4bkpwQTFKQVM3MV9qUHJQWjBkZDlZOHhpR2pESXE5ajlyVldCT1R5WUttb2ZVa0VsbnV6N1B4bjgzai1zdEU3cjR4SFBnNi03RjB2NGNjMHRWZ1paQQ</guid></item><item><title>加利福尼亚州麻疹发病率上升：今年迄今为止的病例数超过2024年全年-《洛杉矶时报》 | Measles on the rise in California: More cases so far this year than all of 2024 - Los Angeles Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxQdHc0Um9panlwVEVzV2ZMVWY5Vzl6NHdlQkhPTEEtel9iaU1uTE5PTTV3TWQxXzFqZmI5V093TXJVdXNBRG55NnhaMF9wSG10Y0R0TUQxUkRpSFc4VzIyVW5wRm5ZOVk4eElzYzBHVmt5c1JkYkJNeU9ZdXQtV05tNm4wVHItU1pqWGl3dUF6NVBKdmtUdnZzcEIzajdNWFJVSk14cmdjQzhhemptMVhMR0lGY0d5dDAzWWFYeEhQV2NWMjBoYi1nSU4wZThyQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cmsFontBrandText font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;California has already reported more measles cases this year than in all of 2024, a worrisome development that comes as the nation is suffering its largest outbreak of the super-infectious disease in decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extent of the national outbreak has rocketed measles from a back-of-mind issue — one rarely, if ever, encountered by a whole generation of Americans — to a pressing public health concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is completely preventable,” Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional chief of infectious diseases at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, told The Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uptick in confirmed measles cases in California, while still somewhat concerning for local public health officials, pales compared  with the significant outbreak that began in Texas earlier this year and has since spread to surrounding states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas has reported at least 750 measles cases; New Mexico, 81; Kansas, 80; North Dakota, 28; and Montana, 23, according to the respective states’ health departments. Michigan has reported 15 cases; Ohio and Illinois, 10, and Arkansas and Indiana, eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus is spreading almost universally among people who either haven’t been vaccinated, or whose vaccination status is not known, authorities note. But the MMR shots, so named because they also afford protection against mumps and rubella, has long &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-01-24/anti-vaccination-forces-fight-california-vaccine-legislation"&gt;been in the crosshairs&lt;/a&gt; of anti-vaccine activists and skeptics — some of whom &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-06-13/kennedy-new-cdc-panel-vaccine-misinformation"&gt;are now in charge&lt;/a&gt; of shaping U.S. policy regarding childhood immunizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 17 cases of measles reported so far this year among California residents, up from the 15 reported all of last year, according to the state Department of Public Health. Doctors have been increasingly on alert for measles, which for decades has been so rare that many physicians haven’t encountered a single case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of that recent rarity, many may be unfamiliar with how readily measles can spread — or the serious symptoms it can cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not just a mild childhood disease,” Dr. Erica Pan,  director of the California Department of Public Health and state public health officer, said in a recent &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/ftMPCRkOqAQ?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=1226" target="_blank"&gt;briefing&lt;/a&gt; to doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles has a death rate of  1 for every 500 to 1,000 cases, Pan said. Nationwide, more than 145 people have been hospitalized with measles so far this year, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;federal data show&lt;/a&gt;, and many of those hospitalized have needed intensive care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can cause very severe disease — often causes a viral pneumonia that is severe enough to need intensive care,” Pan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;div class="video-enhancement" data-vertical data-video-disable-history&gt;   &lt;div class="video-enhancement-player"&gt;   &lt;gn-video-player class="gvp block relative  aspect-[9/16] overflow-hidden  w-full bg-cms-color-brand-background lg:z-10" data-video-player data-video-authors="Rong-Gong Lin II, Mark E.

It is so infectious you can catch it just by being in a room where an infected person has been — even up to two hours after they left, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming majority of the measles cases are associated with &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; tied to close-knit communities with low rates of vaccination, according to the CDC. Recent outbreaks have occurred in areas with a notable population of &lt;a class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-mexico-canada-ontario-0956a30c043b030ae79bc9f67c6ce89c" target="_blank"&gt;certain Mennonite Christian communities&lt;/a&gt;, starting last fall in Ontario, Canada, which was linked to a large gathering in New Brunswick; then in &lt;a class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-vaccinations-mennonites-4880035d6fd53cc029b531f5adda95ad" target="_blank"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and New Mexico in late January; and more recently in the Mexican state of &lt;a class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-measles-vaccines-misinformation-mmr-mennonites-misinformation-ea6158b9a4d513b20f33cbc09034e5c2" target="_blank"&gt;Chihuahua&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Associated Press. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AP reported that officials in Mexico and the U.S. say the outbreaks in their countries &lt;a class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-new-mexico-kansas-vaccine-e904ec9781f1d164c73afe4ab71774fe" target="_blank"&gt;match&lt;/a&gt; the strain found in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says that 95% of this year’s measles cases in the U.S. occurred among people who were either unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. About 29% of cases occurred in children younger than 5, with an additional 37% in those age 5 to 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, the U.S. has reported 1,227 confirmed measles cases so far this year. That’s already rivaling the highest single-year total seen this century — 1,274 were reported in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You would have to look back a generation to find a higher total than that: 2,126 cases were reported nationwide in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And those are probably an underreporting,” Pan said of this year’s case count. Doctors, she said, have learned that most people affected by the measles outbreaks are reluctant to get themselves or their children tested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three measles deaths have been reported so far this year, according to the CDC. Two were &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; school-aged children — both of whom were unvaccinated and had no known underlying health conditions, according to state health officials. The other was an unvaccinated adult in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" target="_blank"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; who didn’t seek medical care before dying, according to health authorities there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One death has been reported in Mexico, according to the World Health Organization. That person was also unvaccinated. More than 3,300 confirmed and suspected measles cases have also been reported in &lt;a class="link" href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" target="_blank"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One infant, who was infected with measles before being born premature, died in Canada earlier this month, according to Dr. Kieran Moore, the chief medical officer for the province of Ontario. The infant’s mother was not vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infant faced other serious medical complications unrelated to the virus, but measles “may have been a contributing factor in both the premature birth and death,” Moore said in a &lt;a class="link" href="https://news.ontario.ca/en/statement/1006004/statement-from-the-chief-medical-officer-of-health" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year marks the first time a child has died from measles in the United States since 2003 — and the child in that case had a rare genetic condition that impaired the immune system. It’s also the first time since the 1990s that more than two people have died from measles in the U.S. in a single year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most associated with its telltale rash, health officials warn measles can cause symptoms that cross the boundary from discomfort to danger. Measles can cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. And years after contracting measles, people can later develop subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, or &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-measles-sspe-20150624-story.html"&gt;SSPE&lt;/a&gt;, a rare but fatal complication resulting from a weakened form of the virus remaining in the body, and later infecting the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a really, really unusual time to see this many deaths — and seeing previously healthy children with a vaccine-preventable death in the United States,” Pan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can also cause something called “&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/measles-infection-can-cause-immune-amnesia" target="_blank"&gt;immune amnesia&lt;/a&gt;.” “It can actually suppress people’s immune systems for a few years after having that measles infection,” Pan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles outbreaks in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/Admin-Meales/doc/measles-vaccination-pep-recommendations.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1536#:~:text=Infants%206%20through%2011%20months%20receive%20an%20early%20dose%20of,through%206%20years%20of%20age." target="_blank"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nmhealth.org/publication/view/guide/9193/" target="_blank"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; are so severe that state health officials are recommending early vaccination in babies as young as 6 months in the hardest-hit counties. Those officials are also recommending a second dose for many children earlier than the typical schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard CDC recommendation is that children receive the first of two measles vaccine shots when they turn 1, unless they are &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;traveling internationally&lt;/a&gt;, in which case they can get vaccinated at 6 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California, there is no active measles outbreak, so there’s no recommendation for additional or accelerated vaccine doses, Pan said. Most of California’s measles cases this year have involved people who traveled internationally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helping matters is California’s relatively high vaccination rate among kindergartners. For the 2023-24 school year, 96.2% of California’s kindergartners were &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-04-25/measles-confirmed-in-l-a-county-resident-who-recently-returned-from-texas"&gt;vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; against measles, according to the CDC — one of the higher rates of any state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest figure is &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-03-19/california-school-vaccines-measles-immunity"&gt;down slightly&lt;/a&gt; from the 96.5% seen the year earlier, but it remains above the levels seen prior to 2014-15, when a severe measles outbreak linked to Disneyland prompted state legislators to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-ln-governor-signs-tough-new-vaccination-law-20150630-story.html"&gt;strengthen&lt;/a&gt; vaccination requirements for children who attend school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts aim for a 95% vaccination rate for measles to guard against outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, California’s measles case rate remains much lower than the national rate. But that doesn’t mean the state is invulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are settings in which unvaccinated people can cluster together, such as group outings of children who are &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-04-23/independent-study-charter-schools-are-a-soft-spot-in-californias-vaccine-laws-data-show"&gt;homeschooled&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another vulnerable setting can be doctor’s offices. In 2008, an unvaccinated 7-year-old boy &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-vaccine2-2008may02-story.html"&gt;returned home to&lt;/a&gt; San Diego from a trip to Switzerland, became sick, then went to school and was taken to the pediatrician. Investigators found that measles then spread to 11 other children who were either unvaccinated or too young to be vaccinated — five in his school, four who were in the pediatrician’s office at the same time he was, and both of his siblings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those infected were three infants younger than 1, one of whom was hospitalized for two days, according to a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5708a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published by the CDC. Another infant traveled by plane to Hawaii while infectious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some California counties also have measles vaccination rates for kindergartners that are below the 95% goal. For the 2023-24 school year, San Diego County’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-03-19/california-school-vaccines-measles-immunity"&gt;rate&lt;/a&gt; is 94.8%; San Bernardino County’s is 93.5%; Santa Cruz County’s is 91.8%; and Kern County’s is 90.7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, a measles outbreak in Los Angeles County was &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-measles-20170120-story.html"&gt;centered&lt;/a&gt; in an Orthodox Jewish community, with a number of patients living in Westside L.A., the Santa Monica Mountains and the San Fernando Valley. In early 2019, California’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-measles-outbreak-la-20190429-story.html"&gt;biggest measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; was in Butte County, and started after a man visited the Philippines, a country that was then in the midst of a massive outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time measles caused scores of deaths nationwide was in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Between 1989 to 1991, there were about 55,000 cases and more than 130 suspected measles-associated deaths, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00020688.htm" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California, that epidemic was the worst between 1988 and 1991 — with 18,000 cases, 3,500 hospital admissions and 70 deaths reported, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1307555/?page=1" target="_blank"&gt;state health officials&lt;/a&gt;. A big problem officials identified at that time was that poor parents could not afford vaccinations for their children. One of the nation’s largest outbreaks in 1989 involved mostly preschool-aged children in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001632.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of the outbreak, the CDC’s Advisory &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank"&gt;Committee&lt;/a&gt; on Immunization Practices &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/00038256.htm" target="_blank"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; a second dose of the measles vaccine be given between the ages of 4 and 6. And in the early 1990s, the federal government &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/online/vfc.html#:~:text=The%20VFC%20program%20was%20authorized,operational%20on%20October%201%2C%201994." target="_blank"&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; the Vaccines for Children program, which funds a number of vaccinations for children with low-income parents. In 2000, officials &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; that measles was no longer being continuously transmitted locally in the U.S., and new cases were only found when someone was infected abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L.A. County has recorded four cases of measles so far this year among residents, up from one all of last year. Most of the cases this year were associated with someone who either traveled internationally or to domestic areas suffering community transmission of measles, according to the local Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also two reported cases among non-county residents this year, including an &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubdetail.cfm?unit=media&amp;amp;ou=ph&amp;amp;prog=media&amp;amp;cur=cur&amp;amp;prid=4971&amp;amp;row=25&amp;amp;start=1" target="_blank"&gt;infant&lt;/a&gt; traveling through Los Angeles International Airport on a flight from &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-04-25/measles-confirmed-in-l-a-county-resident-who-recently-returned-from-texas"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; who was returning home to &lt;a class="link" href="https://ochealthinfo.com/press/measles-case-orange-county-0" target="_blank"&gt;Orange County&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, there were six non-L.A. County residents who had measles while traveling through L.A. County; four had traveled through Los Angeles International Airport while infectious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With measles cases rising across the country and globally, it’s important for unprotected individuals to consider preventive measures. Immunization provides the best protection. Additionally, anyone who was exposed should monitor for symptoms,” the Orange County Health Care Agency said in a statement to The Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include fever, rash, cough and red, watery eyes. People can be contagious from about four days before the rash begins through four days afterward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those suspecting they have measles should call their medical provider before they go to the doctor’s office to avoid potentially exposing other patients, the Health Care Agency said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash traditionally starts at the hairline and moves its way down the body, according to Pan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaiser has seen one case of measles this past month, which was in the Santa Clarita area, Hudson said. Health officials said people were possibly &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubdetail.cfm?unit=media&amp;amp;ou=ph&amp;amp;prog=media&amp;amp;cur=cur&amp;amp;prid=5059&amp;amp;row=25&amp;amp;start=1" target="_blank"&gt;exposed&lt;/a&gt; to the contagious individual at a Costco, Trader Joe’s and Walmart on the afternoon of May 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, has an excellent safety record. Hundreds of millions of children have safely received the vaccine worldwide,” she said in a statement to The Times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxQdHc0Um9panlwVEVzV2ZMVWY5Vzl6NHdlQkhPTEEtel9iaU1uTE5PTTV3TWQxXzFqZmI5V093TXJVdXNBRG55NnhaMF9wSG10Y0R0TUQxUkRpSFc4VzIyVW5wRm5ZOVk4eElzYzBHVmt5c1JkYkJNeU9ZdXQtV05tNm4wVHItU1pqWGl3dUF6NVBKdmtUdnZzcEIzajdNWFJVSk14cmdjQzhhemptMVhMR0lGY0d5dDAzWWFYeEhQV2NWMjBoYi1nSU4wZThyQQ</guid></item><item><title>哈勒奎因鱼鳞病：一种罕见的遗传性疾病，给婴儿带来坚硬的“鳞片” - Live Science | Harlequin ichthyosis: The rare genetic disease that gives babies hard 'scales' - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNbkVpS2FfcWQ5bDQwSEltWmxMRWVmZWYyd1lMdzV1TGhTS0NXTW1sZ1BuWVZtcENGeW9uMTg4Zm0yYUZTODlQZFFHcS1UbHdKeEd6dmFwaG5iOHQzZ3pCcmdNazE2M0xSVWlpNjh6S2pobTZXOFZidkV1VkpkT1c1QlE0QjF5bklQODhFSW5Ba0dEbTR3VkpmSUFUUFdGV2VIYklrOUotQmNadWhLcWJtMXFxY2ltVlh6MmJB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;

These proteins are key for transporting fats and enzymes in the outermost layer of the skin, known as the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/skin-facts-about-the-bodys-largest-organ-and-its-functions" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/skin-facts-about-the-bodys-largest-organ-and-its-functions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;epidermis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/harlequin-ichthyosis/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/harlequin-ichthyosis/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Most people with harlequin ichthyosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; carry a genetic mutation that causes cells to make ABCA12 proteins that are too short and thus unable to properly transport fats. In some cases, people can't make the protein at all, which results in the most severe cases of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that the condition is inherited in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/ichthyosis-harlequin-type/#causes" target="_blank" data-url="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/ichthyosis-harlequin-type/#causes" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;an autosomal recessive pattern&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, meaning a baby must inherit two copies of the broken gene — one from each parent — to develop the disorder. People with only one mutant copy of the gene are "carriers" but do not show symptoms. People with a family history of the disorder can consider seeking genetic counseling to see if they're a carrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms:&lt;/strong&gt; The transportation of fat molecules in the epidermis is important for keeping the skin hydrated, and it's also necessary for the skin to develop properly in the womb and after birth. When babies have ABCA12 proteins that are too short or totally absent, these infants are born with thick, platelike scales of skin, which cause the skin to be stretched very tightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tight skin cracks easily, forming fissures. The tension pulls at the affected baby's eyelids and lips, turning them inside out, and it also constricts the movement of the chest, which impedes breathing and eating. Poor nail and hair growth are also common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bjarao9VpcejFigfa2uuDj" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bjarao9VpcejFigfa2uuDj slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies with harlequin ichthyosis are often born prematurely, and they may also show additional symptoms and traits, such as a flat nose, abnormal hearing, ears that are fused to their head, swollen hands and feet, and decreased joint mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition compromises the skin's protective barrier, leaving the infant vulnerable to dehydration and unable to regulate their temperature or fight infections well. For infants that survive the newborn period, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560492/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560492/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the "armor-like" plates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; eventually shed and the remaining skin is very red, dry and scaly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infants with harlequin ichthyosis often don't survive the newborn period, but with intensive medical care, it's possible for them to survive &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.firstskinfoundation.org/brenna-w" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.firstskinfoundation.org/brenna-w" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;to later infancy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, childhood and even early adulthood, in some cases. A &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://read.qxmd.com/read/21339420/harlequin-ichthyosis-a-review-of-clinical-and-molecular-findings-in-45-cases?redirected=slug" target="_blank" data-url="https://read.qxmd.com/read/21339420/harlequin-ichthyosis-a-review-of-clinical-and-molecular-findings-in-45-cases?redirected=slug" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report that reviewed 45 cases of the disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that about 55% of the patients survived the newborn period, with survivors ranging from 10 months to 25 years old at the time of survey. Common causes of death in the period shortly after birth included respiratory failure and/or sepsis, a dangerous body-wide immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatments: &lt;/strong&gt;There is no cure for harlequin ichthyosis, so care aims to manage the symptoms of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/harlequin-ichthyosis#management-and-treatment" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/harlequin-ichthyosis#management-and-treatment" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, babies with the condition are cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) immediately after birth. There, they can be placed in high-humidity incubators to help regulate their temperature and skin hydration. They're also bathed often to soften and loosen the skin plaques, and exfoliating techniques might be used to help remove the scales. Moisturizers and skin barrier repair formulas can also help with the excessive skin dryness and stiffness. Various pain relievers can help make newborns more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In severe cases, medications called retinoids may be used and are typically given orally. These drugs help to break down the thick, platelike scales covering the skin, which, in turn, may reduce other symptoms of the condition. However, these medications are conserved for severe cases because they can have toxic side effects if used over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibiotics may be needed to prevent or counter skin infections. The eyes should also be lubricated regularly, as infants with the condition cannot close their eyelids properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once discharged from the NICU, children with harlequin ichthyosis require ongoing skin care, as well as lifelong medical care to manage additional symptoms that may emerge due to their condition. This care usually requires a diverse team of medical specialists, including ophthalmologists, plastic surgeons, nutritionists, physical and occupational therapists, and speech and language therapists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-bjarao9VpcejFigfa2uuDj-3tAV2KfXE1dr2ZkWDEVeOAznq5dKFHtb" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-bjarao9VpcejFigfa2uuDj-3tAV2KfXE1dr2ZkWDEVeOAznq5dKFHtb slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Wet AMD occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow in the back of the eye, harming the macula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AMD is a leading cause of vision loss among the elderly in developed countries,” &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Siwei-Liu-2304745211" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Siwei Liu&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology for Shiyan Taihe Hospital at Hubei University of Medicine in China, told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As there is currently no cure, identifying new modifiable factors is crucial for slowing disease progression, preserving vision, and improving patients’ quality of life,” Liu added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liu is the lead author of a new study published in the journal &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Wiley" rationale="Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fsn3.70439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Food Science &amp;amp; Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, which has found that a combination of genetics and drinking instant coffee may increase a person’s risk of developing dry AMD. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers first obtained coffee consumption data for more than 500,000 participants from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt; genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics. Scientists broke participants into &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325502" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;decaffeinated&lt;/a&gt;, ground, and instant coffee consumption groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also obtained both dry and wet AMD data for adults 50 and over from the &lt;a href="https://www.finngen.fi/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Finngen GWAS dataset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide and is rich in &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;polyphenols&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/301506" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; that may offer neuroprotective effects,” Liu explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“At the same time, growing evidence shows that genetics influence dietary preferences. Studying the genetic predisposition to coffee consumption and its relationship with AMD risk may help reveal potential causal links between diet and eye diseases,” the study author noted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, researchers identified an overlap between a person’s genetic disposition towards drinking instant coffee and their risk for dry AMD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additionally, within this genetic correlation, scientists found that drinking instant coffee, compared to other types of coffee consumption, increased dry AMD risk by about sevenfold. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This genetic overlap suggests that there may be shared biological pathways or metabolic mechanisms connecting the preference for instant coffee with the risk of developing dry AMD,” Liu said. “It provides new insight into AMD pathogenesis and offers a potential direction for personalized prevention strategies, such as gene-informed lifestyle interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers stated they did not find any association between coffee consumption and wet AMD risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next steps in this research, Liu said she and her team plan to validate the association in independent populations and conduct functional studies to explore whether the metabolic pathways linked to instant coffee consumption are directly involved in AMD pathophysiology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also aim to perform longitudinal cohort analyses to clarify the causal relationship between coffee intake and AMD progression,” Liu added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT &lt;/em&gt;had the opportunity to speak with &lt;a href="https://www.gwsvision.com/eye-doctors/david-geffen-od/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;David I. Geffen&lt;/a&gt;, OD, FAAO, director of optometric and refractive services at the Gordon Schanzlin New Vision in La Jolla, CA, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study finds an interesting association with instant coffee and AMD,” Geffen, who was not involved in the research, commented. “With our population living longer, AMD is one of the leading disabilities in the senior population. Any change in lifestyle to minimize this risk is well worth exploring.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the large increase in AMD seen in [the United States] it is important to continue with vital research in this area,” he added. “The costs associated with caring and treating AMD patients it is worthwhile to find ways to minimize the risk associated with this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geffen said that while he found this research interesting, he would need to see a more direct association before he would tell patients not to drink instant coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Questions like how much instant were being consumed by those individuals with AMD. Also, is social economic class associated with this? Is there some lifestyle associated with the risk in these individuals? This is way too early to make large assumptions about instant coffee drinking.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/benjamin-b-bert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Benjamin Bert&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified ophthalmologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this research, who shared that it fascinated him in two different ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First the study demonstrates one of the future directions of medicine that we have been hearing about: directing care based off of someone’s specific DNA risk profile,” Bert, who was not involved in the research, explained. “In this study they found that people have a higher risk of dry AMD with certain genetic markers and consumption of instant coffee.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Which brings the second fascinating part of the study, food as medicine,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More and more we are realizing how our food and drink choices can impact our overall health. This study once again points to the dangers of highly &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318630" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, like dehydrated instant coffee, compared to its more natural form of brewed coffee, which had no added risks.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Benjamin Bert, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With additional research, it would be beneficial to know other foods that could be risks for these patients,” Bert added. “Is instant coffee the only food risk?

And of those who do, 1 in 5 get at least a quarter of their calories that day from fast food. Just over 1 in 12 get more than half their day’s calories that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Those numbers are based on an assessment by the National Center for Health Statistics in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, using findings of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between August 2021 and August 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report, released Wednesday night, noted that “fast-food consumption has been associated with an increased intake of calories, fat, sodium and sugar, and with a lower intake of fiber, calcium, iron, fruits, dairy, whole grains, nuts and seeds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers said that “restaurant fast food/pizza” was considered fast food in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Overall, fast food accounted for 11.7% of calories adults consumed on a given day. The share was higher for younger adults. Those ages 20 to 39 got more than 15% of calories from fast food, as did just under 12% of those 40 to 59 and 6% of those 60 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Both those with college degrees and those with high school diplomas ate less fast food than those with some college but no degree. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While the report said there is a link between higher fast food calorie consumption and increasing weight, it also noted that the percentage of calories consumed from fast food decreased between its 2013-2014 assessment (14.1%) and the 2021-2023 assessment (11.7%). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to the survey data, there was no significant difference in the share of calories that men and women got from fast food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="What-are-kids-eating" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;What are kids eating?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In a separate analysis released at the same time, the researchers wrote that “fast-food consumption is associated with higher caloric intake and poorer diet quality in children and adolescents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But a lot of kids eat fast food on any given day, especially among those who are older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to the report, between 2015 and 2018, 36.3% of children ages 2 to 19 ate fast food on a given day and the average youth got 13.8% of their calories from fast food. So the researchers were interested in seeing whether the trend changed or stayed relatively the same between August 2021 and August 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;They found fast-food consumption dropped to 30.1% consuming it on a given day, getting 11.4% of their daily calories from fast food. When they broke it into age groups, the mean share of calories consumed from fast food was 8.5% for children 2 to 11 and 14.6% for those ages 12 to 19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Again, there was no significant difference between males and females in either age category. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report showed that among all children ages 2 to 9, the mean percentage of calories from fast food dropped compared to analysis of fast food consumption in 2017 through March 2020. Among the older age group, mean calories from fast food consumption had risen starting in 2013, then dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Finding-healthy-fast-food" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Finding healthy fast food&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Fast food sometimes gets a bad rap, according to &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthy-fast-food-restaurants" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthy-fast-food-restaurants"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“While most fast foods are based on cheap, unhealthy ingredients, many fast-food establishments now offer nutritious entrees and sides. Popular examples include wraps, salads, and burritos,” the Healthline article said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A study in the journal &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11983999/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11983999/"&gt;Public Health Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; found that “85% of menu items from the six highest-selling fast-food restaurants in the USA are ultra-processed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers, from Arizona State University and State University of New York at Oneonta, analyzed 740 menu items, looking at their ingredients to determine how processed they were. They also recommended that fast-food restaurants consider adding more minimally processed foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But Healthline reports that “almost every fast-food restaurant offers healthy options. If not, the meals can sometimes be modified to suit your dietary preferences or needs.” The article notes that “fast-food restaurants usually have vegetarian options as well. Take your time reading through the menu. You’ll most likely find something healthy, or something that can be made healthier with simple modifications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Chloë Ward, a nutritionist, told &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14833017/healthy-food-fast-nutritionist.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14833017/healthy-food-fast-nutritionist.html"&gt;The Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt; that moderation is key, but sometimes you crave a less healthy option and that’s OK. Balance matters, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“From a functional perspective, we want to focus on blood sugar balance, lowering inflammation and supporting digestion — even when convenience is the priority,” she said. “The goal is to make fast food work with your body, not against it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Besides picking the healthier options, Ward suggests bringing a few with you, such as nuts or avocado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“You can absolutely support your health and still grab something from a drive-thru when needed,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 04:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNQWpsazBuQVd3Q3JnV3ByUnJWN2ZFS1c2VFhhMW84UnVpQV9La1hUenF6djRCdjdwUWpfRHJNUlVEdHFtdzFfRU5qVENMQkhKT0pBbnR2dFJINzlrMDdPTk1wVXlwZUtvZUIwaXBkZmVfc1VBOG40c0hQODd3ZVlSd3RtdHVKeU9qNWMyZDMtcTZ3VG1XZllNc2luTDctUQ</guid></item><item><title>专家对每天不亲密的情侣发出紧急警告...因为他们揭示了隐藏的风险-每日邮报 | Experts' urgent warning to couples who aren't intimate every day... as they reveal hidden risk - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Leading relationship experts are revealing the potential dangers of skipping daily intimacy - warning couples it could lead to the demise of their relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And they're not talking about sex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mariah Freya, sex education expert and co-founder of Beducated, a sex-education platform, is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-2837203/Kissing-ten-seconds-passes-80m-bugs-keeps-healthy.html"&gt;urging couples to kiss more&lt;/a&gt;, especially if they feel the relationship is lacking a spark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Kissing is the most underrated relationship tool. Couples obsess over date nights, whether they're having 'enough' sex, and communication techniques, but they're sleeping on the one thing that actually predicts whether they'll stay happy together.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Freya claims that couples who regularly indulge in kissing each other instead of settling for pecks tend to have less conflict, an increased desire for intimacy and better emotional connection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it seems that research supports her as previous studies have found a correlation between kissing and relationship satisfaction.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 study found how frequently a couple kisses is a strong indicator of both sexual and relationship satisfaction - the more couples kissed, the happier they were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the researchers also found that regular kissing can reduce anxiety and improve overall relationship quality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Freya continued: 'Something magical happens when we stop going about kissing in a mechanical way and really focus on it, even if it's for a few seconds more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's when your brain shifts from 'greeting mode' to 'connection mode.' Your partner literally becomes more attractive to you.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers found that regular kissing can reduce anxiety and improve overall relationship quality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But not all couples are indulging in the simple act of love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2011 survey found that one in five married couples don't pucker-up with their partner for an entire week, while two in five married people lock lips for just five seconds or less when they do kiss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surprisingly, those between the ages of 18 to 24 kiss each other on an average of 11 times per week and five percent of people aged over 45 are managing over 31 kisses each week. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while many may blame busy schedules as the reason why they aren't kissing their partners, Brie Temple, CCO and Chief Matchmaker at Tawkify, warns that it may be a sign of 'something deeper'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'If kissing fades, it's a subtle sign that something deeper is shifting. It's one of the first signs of emotional disconnection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Without those soft moments, partners may find themselves feeling like roommates rather than lovers. It's not just an absence of physical touch, but an absence of shared emotional language that keeps relationships close.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, a lack of kissing between partners may also be a sign of waning physical intimacy, communication challenges and worsening self-esteem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A lack of kissing between partners may also be a sign of waning physical intimacy, communication challenges and worsening self-esteem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sunaree Ko, a Love &amp;amp; Compatibility Expert at TarotCards told DailyMail.com: 'A lack of kissing over time can chip away at intimacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When physical affection fades, couples may start to feel emotionally disconnected, misread each other’s intentions or feel undervalued, especially during stressful periods.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while infrequent kissing combined with issues such as mistrust and other negative emotions may indicate serious cracks in the relationship, simply taking some time out to smooch may do wonders for you and your partner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Sofie Roos, a licensed sexologist and relationship therapist, kissing can release a cocktail of good hormones including oxytocin, dopamine, and serotonin in the brain which can help improve the emotional connection between a couple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told DailyMail.com: 'Oxytocin, also known as the love hormone, which creates feelings of safety, calmness, attachment and affection - in other words: the feeling of being in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By getting oxytocin triggered by your partner through kisses, you have higher chances of keeping the love and attraction alive!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Kissing also releases dopamine, called the feel good hormone, which makes us feel overall satisfied since it creates an euphoric feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Dopamine is the same hormone being released during an orgasm or exercising, but also when taking drugs such as cocaine and heroin, and by getting it from kissing your partner, you get a natural high that not only feels good but that also can maintain the flame and the romantic interest for the person!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Serotonin is the third hormone being released in this hormone cocktail which is dancing in your body while kissing your loved one.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roos continued: 'Serotonin prevents feeling down and depressed, it helps us sleep better, and it also makes us less impulsive and more stable - all factors making our life quality better, as well as making us a better partner!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This natural high is created when all the sensitive nerves on our lips and tongue register the physical stimulation from the kissing and then sends the signals to the brain, which releases the hormones directly in our bloodstream.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, Ko claims that &lt;span&gt;kissing your partner at certain times of the day can help maximize the benefits of the activity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Some of the most successful couples credit a simple ritual of kissing first thing in the morning and last thing at night as their secret to staying emotionally connected, no matter how busy life gets.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a small act with a huge energetic impact, a daily affirmation of love, desire, and loyalty. Even when words fail, a kiss can realign a couple's bond on both a physical and spiritual level.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Weight loss and diabetes jabs taken by more than a million people in the UK have been linked to a potential serious side effect, with some deaths, according to data from the UK medicines regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New figures from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) show the group of drugs that includes Mounjaro, Wegovy, and Ozempic may be associated with inflammation of the pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the MHRA, there have been 181 reported cases of acute or chronic pancreatitis linked to Mounjaro, with five deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wegovy and Ozempic have been linked with 113 reports of pancreatitis and one death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other, less widely used versions of so-called GLP-1 drugs have also been linked to cases and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence that the drugs directly caused the deaths. And the evidence isn't strong enough for the MHRA to restrict access.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;div class="sdc-article-widget sdc-site-video callfn" data-account-id="6058004172001" data-amp-iframe-embed="" data-asset-id="79515574-afb5-448f-860e-21fb52b9103f" data-asset-path="" data-asset-version="" data-autoplay="false" data-auth-config="" data-caption="Weight loss drugs compared" data-clip-type="" data-component-name="sdc-site-video" data-component-name-alias="ui-sitewide-video" data-competition="" data-copy-url-text="URL copied to clipboard" data-fn="sdc-site-video" data-id="id_79515574-afb5-448f-860e-21fb52b9103f" data-is-live-stream="false" data-lite="true" data-options="" data-originator-id="51" data-originator-handle="brightcove-news-gb" data-package-name="" data-provider="brightcove" data-player-id="yjBoKQ5XA" data-playsinline="" data-sensitive="false" data-sdc-id="6913960" data-sdc-video-id="79515574-afb5-448f-860e-21fb52b9103f" data-sport-category="" data-state="loading" data-token-state="none" data-video-ad-unit="" data-video-blacklisted-originator-ids="" data-video-id="ref:79515574-afb5-448f-860e-21fb52b9103f" data-video-type="" data-auto-pause-on-not-visible="true" tabindex="-1" data-closed-captions-position="middle-third" data-show-closed-captions="true" data-show-pip="true" data-show-live-stream-scrubber="true" data-autoload="false"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's because pancreatitis also occurs in people who aren't taking the GLP-1 drugs, with about 560 cases for every one million people in the general population. Gallstones and alcohol are the biggest causes.&lt;/p&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;But the MHRA and Genomics England are launching a new study to see whether some people have genes that put them at higher risk of developing pancreatitis if they take GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People reported through the MHRA's 'yellow card' alert system to have pancreatitis while using the jabs will be asked to provide a saliva sample and their genes tested.&lt;/p&gt;        
&lt;p&gt;Professor Matt Brown, chief scientific officer of Genomics England, said: "GLP-1 medicines like Ozempic and Wegovy have been making headlines, but like all medicines, there can be a risk of serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe there is real potential to minimise these, with many adverse reactions having a genetic cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This next step in our partnership with the MHRA will generate data and evidence for safer and more effective treatment through more personalised approaches to prescription."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="sdc-article-widget sdc-article-image"&gt;

        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main symptoms of pancreatitis are severe pain in the centre of the tummy area, fever and nausea. Acute cases are treated in hospital with fluids and oxygen, and generally make a recovery within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there can be complications, and around 5% of acute cases are fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all medicines, there is a balance of risk and benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with type 2 &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/diabetes-6941" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;diabetes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/obesity-7171" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;obesity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there are clear benefits to using the jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They lower blood sugar levels, lead to rapid weight loss and reduce deaths from cardiovascular disease by a fifth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/weight-loss-jab-warning-from-health-watchdog-over-unborn-babies-13379102" target="_blank"&gt;Weight loss jab warning from watchdog over unborn babies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/gps-can-prescribe-weight-loss-jabs-on-the-nhs-from-today-but-strict-eligibility-criteria-in-place-13387265" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPs can prescribe weight loss jabs on the NHS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/from-ozempic-to-mounjaro-the-diabetes-drugs-repurposed-as-weight-loss-wonders-12823419" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ozempic to Wegovy - what are the weight loss injections?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     
&lt;p&gt;But for people who are a bit overweight and have sourced the jabs privately to lose a few pounds ahead of their summer holiday, the health benefits are far less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a wake-up call for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are powerful medications with effects not just on appetite, but on lots of body organs, including the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And pancreatitis is just one of many possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly, the UK manufacturer of Mounjaro, has said patient safety is its "top priority".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug's patient information leaflet "warns that inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis) is an uncommon side effect (which may affect up to 1 in 100 people)," the statement continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lily "also advises patients to talk to their doctor or other healthcare professional before using Mounjaro if they have ever had pancreatitis," it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Novo Nordisk UK, which manufactures Wegovy and Ozempic, said in a statement: "Patient safety is of the utmost importance to Novo Nordisk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like all medications, side effects can occur and vary from patient to patient. The known risks and benefits of GLP1 medicines are described in the Summary of Product Characteristics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We recommend that patients take these medications only for their approved indications and under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional, who can also advise on potential side effects."&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Preliminary results presented at the &lt;a href="https://sao-paulo.office.cnrs.fr/en/fapesp-week-france-2025/"&gt;FAPESP Week France&lt;/a&gt; health conference suggest the venom from an Amazon rainforest scorpion (&lt;a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/1079599-Brotheas-amazonicus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brotheas amazonicus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) might be able to help treat breast  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="165592" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An aging global population, as well as greater &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-3-years-of-air-pollution-can-increase-lung-cancer-risk-study-warns"&gt;exposure to pollutants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02341-1"&gt;stressed-out ecosystems&lt;/a&gt;, means we are seeing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breast-cancer-is-rising-in-young-american-women-and-we-dont-know-why"&gt;increasing rates of cancer&lt;/a&gt;, dementia, and other diseases. So, in the endless search for more treatment options, some researchers are looking in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/himalayan-fungus-drug-currently-in-human-trials-shown-to-be-potent-cancer-killer"&gt;unlikely places&lt;/a&gt; – like a scorpion's tail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To speed things up, a group of researchers from Brazil have been inserting potential genes of interest into a 'factory' organism's DNA to create the gene's product. They can then test the resulting proteins, like those in scorpion venom, for various medical uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were able to identify a molecule in the species of this Amazonian scorpion that is similar to that found in the venoms of other scorpions and that acts against breast cancer cells," &lt;a href="https://agencia.fapesp.br/amazon-scorpion-toxin-kills-breast-cancer-cells/55106"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; University of São Paulo pharmacologist Eliane Candiani Arantes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-may-have-finally-figured-out-how-bats-avoid-cancer?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Scientists May Have Finally Figured Out How Bats Avoid Cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like chemotherapy drugs, the molecule, BamazScplp1, triggers necrosis – the process of cell death – in the breast cancer cells, causing the cells to rupture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165593" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165593" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Typical-work-fl-ow-for-the-heterologous-expression-of-biosynthetic-gene-clusters-Refer.png" alt="Diagram showing the process of heterologous expression" class="wp-image-165593 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Typical-work-fl-ow-for-the-heterologous-expression-of-biosynthetic-gene-clusters-Refer.png 470w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Typical-work-fl-ow-for-the-heterologous-expression-of-biosynthetic-gene-clusters-Refer-201x415.png 201w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165593" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;How researchers use heterologous expression to create gene products in the laboratory using model organisms like bacteria or fungi.

In this case, Arantes and colleagues used a species of yeast (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komagataella"&gt;Komagataella pastoris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) as factories for their proteins of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using techniques like these could help us track down more of nature's hidden treatments, as long as we &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-report-predicts-southern-amazon-rainforest-is-heading-for-collapse-by-2064"&gt;don't destroy them first&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Eating two ounces of pecan halves every day for twelve weeks trimmed participants’ total cholesterol by a little over 8 mg/dL and lowered their LDL numbers as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Tricia L. Hart of &lt;a href="https://www.psu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pennsylvania State University&lt;/a&gt; conducted the study with 138 adults who already carried at least one metabolic syndrome risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-pecans-the-basics"&gt;Understanding pecans – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pecans (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/misc/ag_654/volume_2/carya/illinoesis.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Carya illinoinensis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) are a species of hickory native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, prized for their nutrient-dense nuts and economic value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Botanically classified as drupes, pecans develop from a flower with a single ovary and encase their edible seed in a hard shell within a green husk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tree thrives in well-drained alluvial soils and requires a temperate climate with warm summers and cold winters to complete its dormancy cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have studied its genome to improve traits such as disease resistance, drought tolerance, and nut quality, which are crucial as climate variability intensifies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pecan trees can live for over a century and often require a decade or more before producing commercially viable yields, making early-stage cultivation decisions critical for long-term success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-linking-pecans-and-low-cholesterol"&gt;Linking pecans and low cholesterol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers randomized volunteers into two groups. One group kept its usual &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/midnight-snack-the-best-foods-for-a-good-nights-sleep/"&gt;snack&lt;/a&gt; pattern, while the other replaced whatever chips or cookies they normally grabbed with raw, unsalted pecans, &lt;em&gt;Carya illinoinensis&lt;/em&gt;, measured to 57 grams a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the final blood draw, the pecan group’s LDL, often nicknamed “bad” cholesterol, fell by 7 mg/dL, and &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=56&amp;amp;contentid=2967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;triglycerides&lt;/a&gt; slid by 16 mg/dL, whereas the control numbers barely budged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No significant changes appeared in blood pressure or flow‑mediated dilation, so the nut’s magic seems aimed squarely at lipids rather than vessel stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-inside-the-body"&gt;What happens inside the body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pecans supply roughly 12 grams of heart‑friendly monounsaturated fat in a one‑ounce handful, plus a spectrum of polyphenols and 34 mg of magnesium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologist &lt;a href="https://www.texasheart.org/people/matthew-segar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matthew Segar&lt;/a&gt; of the Texas Heart Institute explains, “They also suppress post‑meal triglyceride spikes, which is especially important because temporary fat surges can contribute to heart disease over time,” said Segar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oleic acid, the same fatty acid abundant in olive oil, forms about 60 percent of pecan fat.  Replacing refined‑carbohydrate &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dips-can-more-than-double-the-calories-of-your-favorite-snack/"&gt;snacks&lt;/a&gt; with this fatty acid profile can decrease hepatic very‑low‑density lipoprotein synthesis, cutting the pool of LDL precursors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cholesterol-numbers-behind-pecans"&gt;Cholesterol numbers behind pecans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average total‑cholesterol drop of 3.6 percent in Hart’s trial might look small, yet a 5 mg/dL LDL reduction translates to a roughly 4 percent cut in cardiovascular event risk over five years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An updated meta‑analysis pooling more than 50 nut trials shows similar lipid shifts across various tree nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would interpret this trial as confirmation that replacing unhealthy snacks with a modest amount of healthy snacks, including nuts and pecans if you enjoy them, is one way to promote a heart‑healthy diet,” said &lt;a href="https://www.ccpdocs.com/physicians-affiliates/physicians/brett-victor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brett Victor&lt;/a&gt;, MD, Cardiology Consultants of Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because snacks account for about one‑fifth of daily calories for U.S. adults, targeting that slot offers an easy win without a complete menu overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-other-health-benefits"&gt;Other health benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hart’s team noted a nine‑point jump in Healthy Eating Index scores among pecan eaters, indicating better overall diet quality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber climbed by three grams a day and added‑sugar intake fell, echoing &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dietary Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; advice to emphasize nutrient‑dense plant foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ellagic acid in pecans reduces inflammation and oxidative stress, and flavonoids improve blood vessel function, promoting better circulation and cardiovascular wellness,” said preventive dietitian &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, RD&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those anti‑inflammatory touches could help explain observational data linking higher nut consumption, five servings a week or more, to 13 percent lower cardiovascular disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-putting-pecans-on-the-plate"&gt;Putting pecans on the plate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two ounces works out to roughly 30–35 halves. Sprinkle them over oatmeal, blend into a smoothie, or just keep a small reusable container in your bag; consistency matters more than recipe creativity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stick with raw or dry‑roasted pieces to avoid excess sodium and sugar. If flavor boredom strikes, toss them with cinnamon, smoked &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/spicy-foods-can-slow-down-eating-and-cut-calorie-intake/"&gt;paprika&lt;/a&gt;, or a dash of cocoa powder before roasting at 300 °F for ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People watching weight should remember that two ounces deliver about 390 calories. Hart’s participants gained only 1.5 pounds on average, likely because nuts increase satiety, but portion mindfulness still counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone should jump straight into a daily two‑ounce pecan habit without checking their own health context. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/nut-allergies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nut allergies&lt;/a&gt;, especially tree nut sensitivities, must avoid pecans entirely, as even trace amounts can trigger severe reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pecans are also high in caloric density, which can be an issue for those on calorie‑restricted diets. Adding them without adjusting for other energy sources could lead to gradual weight gain, as observed in some participants in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pecans-cholesterol-and-heart-health"&gt;Pecans, cholesterol, and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tree‑nut research now spans controlled feeding trials, long‑term cohorts, and mechanistic studies on endothelial function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together they paint a converging picture: regular nut eaters boast healthier lipid profiles and slightly leaner waistlines than non‑nut eaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replacing just one daily serving of highly processed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/baby-carrots-snack-your-way-to-better-health/"&gt;snacks&lt;/a&gt; with a handful of pecans checks multiple boxes, lower carbs, higher fiber, plant protein, and a bundle of antioxidants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors caution that nuts complement rather than replace statins or lifestyle pillars like exercise, yet this simple swap stands out as one of nutrition’s most agreeable tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916525000577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 01:02:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNTlVxXzkyemJEd014MDg3cm9WV0hzYkNMZU1qUGZ4MUh4akMxR1lFdFpmWGxMRDh5bm1ENkZxV054UnljSTlhZF9WQmV3eWRScF8ySnZnSGI2M1VhQnhwa09QNGI1eU5UUjF2dlUzWGZvaTZaQy16MTU4WFNYSExwUWk0QTQ1UE5rUkVsZjB1U2J0VHZYYkpZYm5JalRYOGhzNEVteA</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，大多数快乐的夫妻基本上都在社交媒体上撒谎- YourTango | Research Says Most Happy Couples Are Basically Lying About This On Social Media - YourTango</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxORElpdG1EWjVuSmJIbmFsWlVPb1NsMXVxQTREQmFhZEdpT2pEeloydkF4REoyeDNRMXpYN0FwRkc1WFR6SE1HX1ZtUUk4dHNXazBYTlJiQzFjUDk2cTJSNktUS0tPbXc5VkpfMFNmWm1uTFRUWTVaNzRrNmwyZGhzRFhvNnJqaEFLaGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the man who broke my heart was officially out of my life, after a long and dramatic goodbye that lasted longer than it should have, I took to Instagram to recover. We had blocked each other on social media, but at least with Instagram, I could prove to him that I had moved on and was happy, that is, if he was so inclined to look at my account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My thinking was that although I was dying inside, I would post photos of just how wonderful my life was without him. I had run off to Paris to recover from the heartbreak, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/rather-travel-world-ever-have-kids"&gt;and traveled around Europe for a bit,&lt;/a&gt; all the while posting photos of me with a smile on my face as I indulged in pizza in Italy, sangria in Barcelona, and spring in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was how I was going to prove to not just him, but to myself, that &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/if-you-cant-get-over-him-do-things-immediately"&gt;I was capable of a life that didn’t include him&lt;/a&gt;. After a while, I finally convinced myself that I was. I don’t know if he ever snooped around my Instagram, but I want to believe he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instagram, as well as other forms of social media, have become a place where people either show only the great parts of their lives or complain and moan about how awful everything is &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/personality-clues-person-insecure-attention-seeker"&gt;in the hopes of getting attention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it seems like that latter group would be the most annoying, in reality, it's all those "happy" people who irk us. A&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2014/09/facebook-posts-reflect-relationship-insecurity.html" rel="nofollow"&gt; 2014 study&lt;/a&gt; shows that those happy people aren't all that happy after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;According to research, most happy couples are lying about how happy they really are on social media.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-06/big-lie-most-happy-looking-couples-tell-social-media.png" alt="man telling lies on social media" title="the big lie most happy-looking couples tell on social media" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Chinnapong / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/painfully-honest-reasons-social-media-causes-relationship-problems"&gt;7 Painfully Honest Reasons Why Social Media Causes Relationship Problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The study found that the more insecure the couple was in their relationship, the more they pretended to be happy on social media.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167214549944?icid=int.sj-full-text.similar-articles.8" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, found that when &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/habits-signal-lack-security-relationship"&gt;people are dealing with relationship insecurity&lt;/a&gt;, they're more likely to post "more relationship-relevant" statuses and photos on social media. In addition, people who are just generally anxious also tend to do the same. It's the whole "smile, though your heart is aching" concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanting to prove that things are better than they are makes total sense. I've always wondered why people take to TikTok to air their dirty laundry and complain about how their &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/if-you-think-hes-cheating-what-immediately-to-do"&gt;boyfriend just cheated on them&lt;/a&gt;, and this has happened more than a few times, and they’ve just suffered a miscarriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand that in such situations, people want to share their grief, but I’m also of the belief that social media is not the platform for such things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/entertainment/what-anniversary-posts-social-media-reveal-about-couples-relationship"&gt;What A Couple's Anniversary Post On Social Media Reveals About Their Relationship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;But painting your life on social media as one big, rosy highlight reel is a bit deluded.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or is it? Perhaps it's hopeful to look at the sunny side of life, even in your darkest moments. Just like it was hopeful of me posting photos of myself on a yacht in the Hamptons &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/how-to-get-over-a-breakup"&gt;after my break-up&lt;/a&gt;, even if the truth was that I was crying into my glass of champagne when the camera wasn’t on me.

It doesn't feel real," says Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She admits being anxious all the way through her pregnancy until June was safely in  her arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Even the pregnancy scans were a new experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We'd never seen anything on a scan before that moved," she says. "When they said 'I can see it, it's in the right place', we both burst into tears."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Anyone can refer themselves to the clinic, but it has a long waiting list and funding issues mean patients must contribute to the cost of the test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Jyotsna Vohra, director of research at Tommy's, said care and treatment for those who experience pregnancy or baby loss varied unacceptably across the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There should be no barriers to accessing any test or treatment that has been proven to make a difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We hope NHS decision-makers will look carefully at the results of the Coventry pilot project and consider rolling this test out nationwide, so that everyone who might benefit has that opportunity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Muter says the next step is to use the test to assess potential drug treatments. Sitagliptin, usually used to treat diabetes, is the go-to option for womb lining issues but there may be other existing drugs which can be repurposed, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;With 80% of drugs not tested on pregnant women, it's unclear which ones might be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 00:01:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5yVWVpNmpfWjFsRzltUk5BcTIwR1MzX3BWcXFGWTduMktpRmxhaElRUE44aEJLejAxVkRBalBOM2liTS1pMVpJWTRGUVVlWWNFS1luSzVTVkdlZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE5SX1ltRmFTc1BxbTFNbmhhbUUtNFlfUkhkTkJqX3RZVGk2dEFhd2Q3Q0ZGRkxtUEVmYkNaLXc1dFVBd3VOVWx1TFhadC03TGlDLUlpRGNydXladFZKcmVz</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，您的血型会影响您早期中风的风险- ScienceAlert | Your Blood Type Affects Your Risk of an Early Stroke, Study Finds - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPSzJRRGpiOF9ZQ3hXU213NGdMSG9MS0hUVm5CY2RYYTBreGZyWEpjTmh3VnBBN1lsNkRzQVpNbFBMaFV2RWtXb0hBN3BwZDFfLTYzVS1KeWNCMEh2MUdyOHdXZVgxWi1uN3pyanNIN0tsTEFYYVdwZ0ZqZG5lUzIzd2FQQmpUcTJWVzRqS0h4Um1COFBkWmd6QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Research suggests a surprising link between blood type and stroke risk, with people carrying one specific group A blood type facing a higher likelihood of stroke before age 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding, published in 2022, deepens our understanding of how our unique biological makeup can impact our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You've probably heard of the A, B, AB, and O groups, which refer to the various chemical markers, known as antigens, found on the surface of our red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_140271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140271" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642.jpg" alt="Diagram of ABO blood groups and the IgM antibodies present in each." class="size-full wp-image-140271" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642-600x386.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-140271" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blood type is partly determined by the ABO blood group antigens present on red blood cells.

All participants were between the ages of 18 and 59.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings revealed a clear relationship between the gene responsible for the A1 blood subgroup, and early-onset stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A genome-wide search revealed two locations strongly associated with an earlier risk of stroke. One coincided with the spot where genes for blood type sit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second analysis of specific types of blood-type gene then found people whose genome coded for a variation of the A group had a 16 percent higher chance of a stroke before the age 60, compared with a population of other blood types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with a gene for group O1, the risk was lower by 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted, however, that the additional risk of stroke in people with type A blood is small, so there is no need for extra vigilance or screening in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still don't know why blood type A would confer a higher risk," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/963353"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; senior author and vascular neurologist Steven Kittner from the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it likely has something to do with blood-clotting factors like platelets and cells that line the blood vessels as well as other circulating proteins, all of which play a role in the development of blood clots."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study findings may seem alarming – that blood type could change early stroke risk – let's put these results into context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year in the US just under 800,000 individuals experience a stroke. Most of these events – around &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6535078/"&gt;three out of every four&lt;/a&gt; – occur in people 65 years and older, with risks doubling every decade after the age of 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the people included in the study lived in North America, Europe, Japan, Pakistan, and Australia, with people of non-European ancestry only making up 35 percent of participants. Future studies with a more diverse sample could help clarify the significance of the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We clearly need more follow-up studies to clarify the mechanisms of increased stroke risk," Kittner &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/963353"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key finding of the study came from comparing people who had a stroke before the age of 60 to those that had a stroke after the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this, the researchers used a dataset of about 9,300 people over the age of 60 who had a stroke, and some 25,000 controls over the age of 60 who didn't have a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the increased risk of stroke in the type A blood group became insignificant in the late-onset stroke group, suggesting that strokes that happen early in life may have a different mechanism compared to those that occur later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strokes in younger people are less likely to be caused by a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries (a process called atherosclerosis) and more likely to be caused by factors to do with clot formation, the authors &lt;a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/99/16/e1738"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that people with type B blood were around 11 percent more likely to have a stroke compared to non-stroke controls regardless of their age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.784"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the part of the genome that codes for blood type, called the 'ABO locus', is associated with coronary artery calcification, which restricts blood flow, and heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic sequence for A and B blood types have also been associated with a slightly higher risk of blood clots in veins, called venous thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/early/2022/08/31/WNL.0000000000201006"&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in September 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pists000t26qg7phi2asb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A century ago, one of the biggest &lt;a href="https://scispace.com/pdf/the-hazards-of-immunization-3ps0h5suhg.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;safety concerns&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines involved bacterial contamination. In 1916, four young children died in South Carolina after receiving typhoid vaccine that had been contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Twelve years later, 12 children in Queensland, Australia, died from tainted immunizations against diphtheria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmccklfmq00053b6mvnf3amap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the 1930s, vaccine makers began using a preservative called thimerosal to stave off microbial growth in their products. For the next six decades, it didn’t receive much notice; ill effects appeared limited to minor local injection-site reactions, according to the US Food and Drug Administration.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0005356mh4k6egvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That changed in 1999, when US health officials asked pharmaceutical companies to remove thimerosal from vaccines. There was no evidence that it caused harm in the quantities used, but thimerosal contains a form of mercury, and questions had emerged about whether it could cause neurotoxicity when given in childhood vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0006356mvc61vd0p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine makers have removed it from all but a few shots, such as multidose vials of flu vaccine. In the meantime, subsequent studies have confirmed no link between thimerosal in vaccines and neurodevelopmental issues, including autism, and autism rates have continued to rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0007356m4p1ym41u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So public health experts were puzzled when the preservative appeared on the agenda for this week’s meeting of outside vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0008356mc0bv7vyv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I actually don’t know any pediatric practices that even use that multidose influenza vaccine,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital Colorado and former liaison to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, for the American Academy of Pediatrics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0009356m1wnianqn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The group is meeting on Wednesday and Thursday for the first time since US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;dismissed &lt;/a&gt;the committee’s previous 17 members, claiming they had conflicts of interest, and days later installed eight new advisers. Public health experts and lawmakers have &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/health/kennedy-vaccine-panel-pressure-warren-cassidy"&gt;called into question&lt;/a&gt; the credentials and backgrounds of some of the new panelists, and just before the meeting began, one member withdrew during the financial holdings review, an HHS spokesman said, bringing the panel down to seven.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pkt7300003b6m63k02sy4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A presentation “regarding thimerosal in vaccines” is scheduled for Thursday morning, followed by “proposed recommendations” specifically about thimerosal in flu vaccines, according to an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-06-23.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt; posted Monday. The meeting is scheduled to conclude with a vote on the latter, a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;move&lt;/a&gt; that could lead to official CDC policy if adopted by agency leadership – or, without a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/23/health/cdc-vaccine-advisers-meeting-cassidy"&gt;confirmed director&lt;/a&gt; in place, by Kennedy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000a356mp0k2ib24@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The last-minute addition of thimerosal to the agenda was a red flag for vaccine experts, who consider the science settled and fear that Kennedy – who &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" target="_blank"&gt;led&lt;/a&gt; an anti-vaccine group called Children’s Health Defense – is seeking to sow doubt about vaccine safety. Another former Children’s Health Defense leader, Lyn Redwood, is slated to make a presentation on the topic at the meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000b356mluk6aumy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s how thimerosal became such a hot-button issue.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000d356m5n8eotlj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 1997, Rep. Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat concerned about mercury pollution in his community’s lakes and rivers, attached an amendment to a US Food and Drug Administration reauthorization bill that would require the agency to catalogue intentionally introduced mercury compounds in drugs and food.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000e356mwh4d1pk9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That led to a possibly&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;startling discovery: “As people looked in vaccines, there was the potential that, by six months of age, infants could have received more thimerosal than was listed in several sources of what was considered safe levels of mercury,” said Dr. Walter Orenstein, who was director of the National Immunization Program at the CDC at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000f356mnflu3t73@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But those limits were set for methylmercury, the kind found in some fish, which is known to be toxic. Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, a different compound that’s “intrinsically less stable, and more readily metabolized, than methylmercury,” said Dr. Matthew Rand, an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Medicine at the University of Rochester who studies mercury toxicity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000g356mcsrnbx70@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That means it’s cleared from the body more quickly than methylmercury, according to the CDC, “and is therefore less likely to cause any harm.” The FDA notes that there were no existing guidelines for ethylmercury.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000h356myvbnzuhn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, the finding led to a number of emergency meetings among federal health officials and outside groups to determine what should be done, Orenstein recalled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000i356mk8khri1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While there was no evidence of harm from thimerosal, the general feeling was, ‘let’s get rid of it, because we don’t need it,’ ” he said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Moving to single-dose containers alleviated the need for a preservative, although it came at a higher expense for manufacturers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000j356mm8qqcuv9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 1999, the FDA sent a letter to manufacturers of US vaccines requesting their plans to remove thimerosal, and by 2001, the compound had been removed from or reduced in all vaccines routinely recommended for children under 6 in the US, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000k356mzecddtkh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The message from public health agencies, Orenstein said, was “we’re going to make safe vaccines even safer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000m356muyw1p1x6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the die was cast. Vaccines had already been tied to autism in 1998 by British doctor Andrew Wakefield, who published a since-&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/02/lancet.retraction.autism/index.html"&gt;retracted&lt;/a&gt; paper that claimed the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine was linked to autism, although not because of thimerosal – the MMR vaccine never contained the preservative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000n356m5v8g4l3m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, parents of children with autism were seeking answers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9q1col00043b6m3f0u81e6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of those parents was Redwood, who said that in 1999, she tallied up her son’s mercury exposure and found “at two months of age, he had received 125 times his allowable exposure to mercury based on EPA’s guidelines in his weight.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000o356mwq2ztmtz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That was a real answer for me,” Redwood said in a &lt;a href="https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/events/the-autism-cover-up-simpsonwood-scandal-25-years-of-fraud-and-corruption/thimerosal-simpsonwood-safeminds-lyn-redwood/" target="_blank"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; posted by Children’s Health Defense this month, “because my son at this time was almost 5 years old, and he had regressed developmentally after his first year of life and was diagnosed with autism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000p356m02wkaj9u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Redwood, a nurse practioner, decided to become an advocate, speaking at events and publishing papers about thimerosal and autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000r356mlgvdnqt6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The uproar over a potential link between thimerosal and autism came as a surprise to Orenstein and colleagues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000s356mcrejhtge@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Mercury itself had never been implicated as a major cause of autism,” Orenstein said. “But this was a major, major concern.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000t356mraqanzmc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It led to a number of studies of the issue, including a 2004 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20669467/" target="_blank"&gt;assessment&lt;/a&gt; by the Institute of Medicine (now &lt;a href="https://nam.edu/about-the-nam/" target="_blank"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; as the National Academy of Medicine) that concluded “the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.” It made the same conclusion for MMR vaccines and autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000u356muqvidsq9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2010 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20837594/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by the CDC also found no link. And “even after thimerosal was removed from almost all childhood vaccines, autism rates continued to increase,” the agency noted, “which is the opposite of what would be expected if thimerosal caused autism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000v356mcn7m30fv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, those who continued to push the disproven autism connection included Kennedy, who published a book in 2014 called “Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak.” Its subtitle calls for the “immediate removal of mercury – a known neurotoxin – from vaccines.” It rejects the findings of the 2004 Institute of Medicine report and warns that millions of children in the US and around the world “appear to be at risk of injury from the thimerosal in vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000w356mu5igi0sv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thimerosal is still present in “a small percentage of flu vaccines, confined to multidose vials,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project/viewpoint-cdcs-upcoming-vaccine-advisory-meeting-set-sow-distrust" target="_blank"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; from the Vaccine Integrity Project, a group focused on countering vaccine misinformation that was started at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, or CIDRAP.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000x356ma38f6j1n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The group suspects that thimerosal is included on ACIP’s agenda this week – with a presentation by Redwood and a vote by the committee – “to put greater focus on and generate more public discussion about vaccine risk.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000y356mjext9xul@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS didn’t return a request for comment about Redwood’s involvement in this week’s meeting, and Redwood declined to comment. Her presentation &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-06-25-26/05-influenza-redwood-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;, however, were posted ahead of the meeting and continued to claim thimerosal presents safety risks. One slide initially included in the presentation cited a study in animals that appeared not to exist; its apparent lead author &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/health/cdc-vaccine-adviser-thimerosal-presentation"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;CNN he’d published a study with a similar title, but in a different journal, in different animals, and with dramatically different findings — ones that didn’t appear to show a link between autism and thimerosal. The slide presentation was subsequently updated to remove that slide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcbwg3jk0000356m7le45aph@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CDC staff also posted its own &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-06-25-26/Thimerosal-Containing-Vaccines-Summary-of-Evidence-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;review &lt;/a&gt;of the data, citing nearly two dozen studies showing “the evidence does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcc30y8i00003b6my84mzqat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During her Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Dr. Susan Monarez, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the CDC, said, “I have not seen a causal link between vaccines and autism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0011356ms66k0ofe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The decision to remove thimerosal from most vaccines, despite no evidence of harm, had other consequences. At the same time the FDA made its request to vaccine makers, US health authorities advised that babies born to mothers known to be negative for hepatitis B not receive a shot for that virus at birth, but at two months to 6 months of age, as thimerosal was phased out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0012356mohamwqlu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But about 10% of hospitals “suspended use of the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, regardless of their level of risk,” wrote Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine scientist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s outside advisory committee on vaccines, in a 2007 perspective &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp078187" target="_blank"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine. “One three-month-old child born to a Michigan mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of overwhelming infection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0013356myj5esyxi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Orenstein looks back on the decision to remove thimerosal as a hard one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0014356mbqkl0x57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fear would be keeping it in there, doing a study over two or three years and then it showed harm, and lo and behold, for three years, we used this vaccine and this component was harmful,” he said. “Since we didn’t know what the results would be of any of the studies at the time, we thought it better to just get it out of there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0015356mu36p9zj1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The autism issue,” he added, “didn’t play any role in the initial decision.”

You can't give the care you want to give," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"You certainly aren't giving the care you're trained to give. It's not the care you'd want your family to receive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There are currently hundreds of people stuck in hospitals across Northern Ireland who are medically fit to be discharged but do not have a care package or an appropriate facility to go to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The BMA said this increases pressure in EDs because people are not moving through the hospital system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The BMA's Dr Clodagh Corrigan says healthcare needs multi-year Executive budgets&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The BBC requested data from all five health trusts under Freedom of Information, including that relating to the height of the winter pressures over Christmas and New Year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They reflect the immense pressure healthcare staff were under at the time, with one nursing leader describing conditions as "intolerable".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Between 12 December 2024 and 20 January this year, 140 patients had to wait in crowded EDs for more than 100 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;At Altnagelvin Area Hospital, one person spent a week in its ED. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The hospital recorded the highest number of patients waiting the longest times, with 48 people waiting for more than 100 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Corrigan said the BMA was calling for greater investment in the health service and multi-year budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The money that exists needs to be used better.

						&lt;p&gt;North Carolina hospitals are on the lookout for patients
with symptoms of measles after the first reported case in the state this week. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state health department confirmed on Tuesday &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/nc-first-measles-case-june-2025/"&gt;a
child in the Greensboro area tested positive for measles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state reported the child had visited several public spaces
since becoming infected and is encouraging others who were in the area to
monitor for symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Triangle-area hospitals tell WRAL they are on alert for any
patient who may be the next suspected measles case.  &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been working hard for months to prepare for an
outbreak of measles or multiple outbreaks at once,” said Dr. David Wohl with
UNC Health. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wohl, an infectious disease specialist, told WRAL the confirmed
case didn’t come as a surprise. He added it is likely the state will see even
more cases because of how contagious the virus is.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“This was inevitable. We knew that eventually we would get a
case here as well,” Wohl said. “Measles is an incredibly infectious virus. It
can linger in the air; it can linger on surfaces. People born before 1957, we
basically assume you are immune because it was so widespread and it is so
catchy, that it’s almost impossible that you weren’t exposed before the
vaccines became available.”&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/triangle-hospitals-alert-measles-case-nc-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In 2000, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; declared measles had been eliminated from the U.S.,
meaning the only new cases were being reported from individuals traveling from
other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael Smith, Duke Health Division Chief of Pediatric Infectious
Diseases, shared the concern with new outbreaks 25 years later lies with fewer
children being fully vaccinated for measles.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Smith explained vaccine misinformation which increased during
the pandemic, including unfounded claims the MMR vaccine was tied to cases of autism,
may be contributing to lower vaccination rates among kids in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Until this year where we’ve had a lot of measles, as a
parent you could say ‘Well measles is not really common in the United States so
I’m not going to worry about it,” Smith said. “That story is not true. The MMR
vaccine does not cause autism. Don’t take it from me as a doctor – I’m a dad
and both my kids are vaccinated. This is a safe and effective vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/triangle-hospitals-alert-measles-case-nc-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/triangle-hospitals-alert-measles-case-nc-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Smith advised parents that not vaccinating their children may
increase their child’s risk of getting severely ill. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Measles can make you very sick. Best case scenario, you
feel awful and it’s like the worst cold of your life,” Smith warned. “There
really is no treatment for this, despite what you may be hearing in the media
these days. The vaccine really is the most important thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;More than 1,220 measles cases and three deaths have been
reported across the United States this year, according to the CDC. The agency
reports 95% of cases occurred in individuals who were unvaccinated or whose
vaccination status was not known. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wohl and Smith agree communication between hospital staff,
clinicians, urgent cares, pediatric offices and health departments will be
crucial to identifying, and slowing potential outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Not everybody who has measles presents as a rash, often
times they present with a really high fever or a sore throat or red eyes,” Wohl
explained. “We have to sensitize people who might be the first folks who see
some of these cases.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Smith added families with upcoming travel plans and have not
been vaccinated should be on high alert. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We know now there is a case in our state,” Smith
said. “There’s no doubt if you’re traveling through any airport you’re going to
come in contact with somebody who may have been exposed to measles, the best
thing you can do is get vaccinated.”





&lt;/p&gt;

The mosquitoes were collected on June 11 as part of the state’s routine surveillance program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made Tuesday by the Connecticut Mosquito Management Program, which includes several state agencies responsible for monitoring mosquito-borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is one of the earlier detections of the virus recorded during the past 25 years of the statewide monitoring program,” said John Shepard, medical entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Philip Armstrong, chief scientist at the CAES, said recent rainfall and ongoing heat are likely to increase mosquito activity and the spread of the virus.

"The CDC now recommends that anyone traveling internationally ensure they’re fully vaccinated against measles prior to their trip."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccination will not only protect you but will also make you less likely to spread it to others if you develop measles," Kay added. "Make sure to get vaccinated &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/cdc-provides-new-measles-vaccine-guidance-with-summer-travel-season-underway" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/cdc-provides-new-measles-vaccine-guidance-with-summer-travel-season-underway" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;at least two weeks before your trip&lt;/a&gt;.

Health officials said that means the risk to the public is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were in the exposure areas at the listed times, public health said you should first check your MMR vaccination records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you develop an illness with a fever or unexplained rash, call a healthcare provider immediately. Officials said to call before going to a clinic or hospital to limit contact with others, especially those without known immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not up to date on vaccinations and were at any of the locations at the times listed, public health said &lt;strong&gt;you would become sick between June 21 and July 13.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who are immunocompromised may take longer than that date range to experience symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/canadian-confirmed-measles-case-sea-tac-airport-vaccination-status-king-county-seattle-public-health-april-6-7-s-concourse-general-public-tukwila-airport-comfort-suites" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/canadian-confirmed-measles-case-sea-tac-airport-vaccination-status-king-county-seattle-public-health-april-6-7-s-concourse-general-public-tukwila-airport-comfort-suites" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Measles exposure warning issued for Sea-Tac airport and Tukwila hotel after traveler visit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About Measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease, causing fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. If one person contracts measles, up to nine out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The disease mainly spreads through the air after a person with measles coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People infected with measles are contagious four days before the rash starts through four days after the rash appears. The incubation period for measles from exposure to fever is usually about seven to 10 days, and from exposure to rash onset is usually about 10-14 days (with a range of seven to 21 days.) People can spread measles before they have the characteristic measles rash. Measles can lead to ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, and in rare cases, encephalitis (brain inflammation) or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy people can experience complications from measles, but those at highest risk include infants and children under five years, adults over 20 years, pregnant people, and those with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination offers safe, effective measles protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent measles, Providence Swedish strongly recommends that everyone receive the safe and highly effective MMR vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles and providing long-lasting protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 21:55:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6wFBVV95cUxPeGVYT2lteDdYUHh5TlNjaGNzeWZmc25lZVRiVjRtdEJpUEZNNzd1dE9pcDhXUUlxNWhxTjVMZHpwYUlNMWFrclY2aXdydXZLSmROUHZwNDNuREotd1B3d21vZU5HNTFFSnMyVm9oZ2szRW5uLWg5SFJBRmN6N28ycTM2VkdyUVREaFNJeHUycUNMd0VyZ1pvTEZRMXYwd213VGs1d25UeFR4YWVIeXplemo5LXgwRFU4SHlnaTdUNlFMWlJvclJUalVydXB4a3VFR1hJN1B3Vy1LM3N4S1I5WExTNUN6dFdIcDZZ</guid></item><item><title>一项新的研究表明，改变这项日常任务的一件事可以将心脏病风险降低一半- Earth.com | Changing one thing about this everyday task cuts heart disease risk in half, says a new study - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOSXMxb2RyRXM3UmRablJqbldDcjNjRWstTzU1Q3pEOC1sc3haNV9fNlBjTmhXS0NLX0xwVWhkVkFuQVJpVE1DY3ZSYTJLZVJEVHMzcE1qQTlWVDRXcnBubkJBRmJSaFNPTjhyTnNRc3Ezc0htbTJMbGpVRDFlLXZId01yQVRuSkVZeHF2RmlucnI4MXoyMWdraWJzSW43eUNINVBYLWFn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease kills more Americans than any other condition, claiming about 941,652 lives in 2022. That’s nearly one out of every five deaths in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new analysis says you can cut that danger in half simply by quickening everyday chores, and it does not require a gym membership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/emmanuel-stamatakis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emmanuel Stamatakis&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt; led the project that quietly tracked more than 24,000 self‑described non‑exercisers with wrist‑worn motion sensors for a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-everyday-movement-and-heart-disease"&gt;Everyday movement and heart disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people think of exercise as planned workouts, yet the trackers revealed that tiny bursts of motion during routine tasks, from carrying groceries to scrubbing a tub, still raise the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/low-carb-or-low-fat-food-quality-is-more-important-for-heart-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each little surge counts toward the 150 minutes of moderate activity that the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; recommends every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers call this incidental physical activity (IPA), a catch‑all for movement that happens naturally while living, working, or commuting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IPA sidesteps the cost, travel, and time barriers that keep roughly three in five U.S. adults from meeting exercise guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, staying seated for long stretches lets blood sugar and blood pressure creep upward, feeding &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease (CVD)&lt;/a&gt;. Over time those changes stiffen arteries and invite clots that trigger heart attacks or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous large‑scale work shows that women who combine at least three different household or leisure activities cut CVD risk by forty percent compared with women who stick to only one type of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-disease-and-movement"&gt;Heart disease and movement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sydney team mined data from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, a massive project linking health records with lifestyle tracking. Participants averaged 62 years old and reported no structured workouts, yet their trackers captured every ten‑second burst of motion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An artificial‑intelligence model sorted each snippet into light, moderate, or vigorous effort. The scientists then waited almost eight years to see who suffered a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/men-and-women-have-different-heart-rhythms-and-now-we-know-why/"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; event or died. Hospital records confirmed 908 major cardiac events and 223 cardiovascular deaths in that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crunching the numbers showed an L‑shaped curve: risk plummeted quickly with the first bits of effort, then leveled off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily totals of just 24 minutes at a moderate clip or 4 to 5 minutes at a vigorous clip predicted roughly fifty percent fewer heart attacks or strokes compared with people who mostly ambled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/gibalam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Martin Gibala&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.mcmaster.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McMaster University&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved, called the work “a solid piece of evidence that even brief bursts matter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-fast-is-fast-enough"&gt;How fast is fast enough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate intensity means you can talk but not sing, like pushing a vacuum cleaner briskly or climbing stairs with purpose. Vigorous intensity steals your breath so that only a few words fit between gasps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, hurrying up two flights of stairs, hauling laundry in double‑time, or sprint‑walking to the mailbox three or four times a day fills that five‑minute vigorous quota. Those minutes do not need to be consecutive; the study counted them whenever they appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stamatakis’ group calculated health “exchange rates.” One vigorous minute matched about three moderate minutes or nearly forty‑five light minutes for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-is-worse-for-the-heart-than-cocaine/"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; protection. That conversion helps people who dislike huffing and puffing find an alternative pace and duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-adding-some-pep-to-your-step"&gt;Adding some pep to your step&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn a slow sweep into a speed sweep by widening your stance and pushing the broom in long strokes. This bumps effort into the moderate zone without special gear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carry grocery bags one at a time up the driveway and time yourself. A shorter trip each night builds a habit of pacing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swap the elevator for the stairs on the way to your apartment or office. The extra sixty seconds of climbing can replace a two‑minute jog later. Gardening can count too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Racing the timer while pulling weeds or raking leaves lifts heart rate beyond the comfortable chatting zone. Small tweaks spread through the day avoid sweating through clothes, a leading barrier cited in surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-of-heart-disease-prevention"&gt;Future of heart disease prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;IPA does not replace structured workouts, which improve muscle strength, balance, and mental health in ways chores cannot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet for millions who struggle to meet formal goals, brisk chores close part of the gap and still leave room for weekend hikes or bike rides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/heart-disease-remains-leading-cause-of-death-as-key-health-risk-factors-continue-to-rise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; reminds us that eighty percent of cardiac events are preventable through lifestyle choices like diet, activity, and smoking cessation. Quick chores could be the lowest‑cost intervention of them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say the findings dovetail with long‑standing advice to break up sitting with movement. Every hour of desk work should end with a brief spell of standing or walking, and adding intensity multiplies the benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biobank cohort was mostly White and middle‑aged, so future studies need to follow diverse younger groups to confirm the effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also hope to test whether digital nudges, such as phone alerts, can prompt timely bursts of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, public‑health campaigns may soon update guidelines to highlight IPA alongside formal exercise, making the message clearer for busy parents and older adults with mobility concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.072253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 21:12:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOSXMxb2RyRXM3UmRablJqbldDcjNjRWstTzU1Q3pEOC1sc3haNV9fNlBjTmhXS0NLX0xwVWhkVkFuQVJpVE1DY3ZSYTJLZVJEVHMzcE1qQTlWVDRXcnBubkJBRmJSaFNPTjhyTnNRc3Ezc0htbTJMbGpVRDFlLXZId01yQVRuSkVZeHF2RmlucnI4MXoyMWdraWJzSW43eUNINVBYLWFn</guid></item><item><title>与较少冲动行为、撞车和犯罪相关的多动症药物- STAT | ADHD medicines linked to less impulsive behavior, crashes, and crime - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQRmhEYkI4NXcxdGl1RGZiYkFyZ1dxanM5QmpnN3p0SG80ODZZU3ZlS1VwbTNDcXhXS3ZPSUlQcmd4ZGpGYmZqSC1mQlV2eGFmNjN0LUJ1SmVZbUZhMGN6dGxqejJ0TnVmdjIxRGJ0MlpFVTVIT2ZDUUVXWkRqbnBjTHUzamswb1I0MVY1NTZfMTF0dU10eC1iTmJzUzJ3dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="author-pop-over" data-author="rose-broderick"&gt;&lt;p class="author-bio"&gt;O.

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Of those students, at least 42 were not fully vaccinated against measles, according to the district. The lack of immunization sparked concern with city officials, especially due to recent outbreaks of the disease in other parts of the country,&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; like Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;700 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; have been reported and &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/06/nation/second-child-dies-measles-texas/?p1=BGSearch_Overlay_Results" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;two children have died&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Nolin and Newton Health and Human Services did not immediately return requests for comment about the stricter policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;To comply with the state requirements, Newton Health and Human Services and school nurses will provide vaccines for students, the district said. There are two exemptions for immunizations: religious exemptions and doctor-approved exemptions for immunocompromised students. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’ve got to follow state law, that’s our responsibility,” said School Committee Chair Chris Brezski, who has two middle schoolers in the system. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Massachusetts recently reported one case of measles from a &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/14/metro/contagious-measles-visits-boston/?p1=BGSearch_Overlay_Results" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Boston tourist&lt;/a&gt;. Measles is one of the most highly contagious diseases, able to stay in the air for two hours. Newton’s quarantine period for unvaccinated students that come into contact with the disease is 21 days. The district is also not required to make up any missed education during that time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the herd immunity threshold for measles is between 92 percent and 94 percent immunization rate.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Massachusetts is currently &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/Vaccine/index.html?_gl=1*41phfd*_ga*MTAwOTE0OTEyMC4xNzUwODYxODg0*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NTA4NjE4ODQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTA4NjE4ODQkajYwJGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*ODgyOTMzODk5LjE3NTA4NjE4ODQ.*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NTA4NjE4ODQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTA4NjE4ODQkajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;above average&lt;/a&gt;, at nearly 95 percent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Newton mother Brenda Anders Pring, 53, is a representative of the Massachusetts Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Although immunization is widespread in the state, it’s important to keep an eye out for any potential risks to students, said Anders Pring, whose children are in middle and high school. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The measles vaccine works really well if most people are vaccinated,” Pring said. “We’re at a place where we had almost eliminated measles and we hadn’t had a death in over 25 years in the country&lt;b&gt;."&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Other parents and teachers agreed with the district’s efforts to comply with state requirements. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Denise Cremlin, a Spanish high school teacher at Newton North, said she was glad the school is taking action to protect students who might be undergoing chemotherapy treatments or have medical conditions that prevent them from getting vaccinated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s not just about me being vaccinated, it’s about how do I keep the other people in my community safe, who might be at more risk than I am,” Cremlin said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jonathan Brenner, 59, a pediatrician and parent of a fourth grader and, said he was surprised it took so long for the district to notify families about the unvaccinated students, and didn’t know exemptions during the pandemic period that allowed students to matriculate without all vaccine requirements hadn’t been updated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“When you have a pocket of unimmunized children, these infectious diseases can spread,” Brenner said. “So I’m fully in support of the reinstatement of these vaccine requirements, and I’m also fully in support of the district’s position that they will not allow students back at school in the fall unless they admit the vaccine requirements.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jessica Weed, 45, has a second grade student in the system. Weed is a stay-at-home mom who wasn’t aware of any chicken pox outbreaks, but agreed with the vaccine reinforcement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Especially for measles, I guess COVID or flu is more of a choice, but measles for sure,” Weed said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Researchers have now shown that, despite individual differences in neuron activity, a shared underlying structure guides the brain toward unified decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By training macaques in a color-choice task and recording neural activity, scientists discovered that neuron responses are shaped by a common “potential landscape” that varies with task difficulty. This study offers a new model for how the brain organizes complex decisions and may inform future understanding of psychiatric conditions that disrupt decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Structure:&lt;/strong&gt; Diverse neurons follow a common potential landscape that shapes their collective decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty Modulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Easier decisions show steeper neural “slopes,” promoting quick choices; harder ones flatten the landscape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding this coordination may shed light on disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Princeton University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every decision begins invisibly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before someone acts, the brain is already hard at work gathering evidence, weighing options, and gradually committing to a choice. But even when faced with the same evidence, people can arrive at different outcomes, especially when the decision is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two different drivers in rush hour traffic, for example, see the same congested road, yet one might speed up to merge while another cautiously brakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the brain, made up of billions of specialized cells, makes these split-second decisions has largely been a mystery, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, new findings from Princeton University, in collaboration with researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Stanford University, and Boston University, shed light on how diverse brain cells come together to guide a unified decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that while individual neurons have perplexingly complex responses, their activity is shaped by a shared structure that ultimately guides the brain toward a unified choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; on June 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classic experiments in neuroscience have shown that the brain maps simple sensory information, like basic shapes or sounds, in predictable ways. A black rectangle rotated at a 45-degree angle will activate a specific group of cells in the visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change the angle slightly, though, and a different group lights up. But decisions, especially when tied to action, are more complicated than distinguishing slightly different tones or shapes, making it difficult for researchers to identify the neural code that guides decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome this challenge, the research team trained rhesus macaques to determine which color (red or green) was more dominant on a checkered screen. Easy trials were clear-cut, but ambiguous ones required careful deliberation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the monkeys considered their choice, researchers recorded activity from nerve cells in the dorsal premotor cortex, a brain region involved in translating decisions into actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that neurons responded very differently, even within the same trial, suggesting a high degree of “heterogeneity” or variability, in the neural code for decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The widespread assumption is that this heterogeneity reflects the complex dynamics involved in cognition,” said Tatiana Engel, Ph.D., associate professor at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But surprisingly, we found that this apparent complexity arises from a very different neural coding principle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explain this diversity, the team developed a flexible computational model that revealed two critical features driving each neuron’s behavior: 1) tuning: when and to what kind of decision a neuron tends to respond; and 2) neural dynamics: represented by a “potential landscape” that guides activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this model, valleys in the landscape represent stable decision that’s been made. As neural activity unfolds, it’s like a ball rolling across the terrain: steeper slopes push activity more decisively toward a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fitted to real data, the model showed that tuning remained consistent across easy and hard trials, but the shape of the potential landscape changed. In easier tasks, the landscape was steep, leading to quicker, more confident decisions. In harder tasks, the terrain was flatter and more susceptible to noise, increasing the chances of mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though each neuron had a different individual response, they all appeared to share the same underlying potential landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of it like a group of skiers descending a mountain,” Engel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each prefers a slightly different path, but all are shaped by the same slope beneath them. Similarly, each neuron has its own preference and activity, but the group of cells collectively in the premotor cortex takes a coordinated journey and gradually settles into a stable state that represents the decision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how neurons collaborate to make decisions could offer deeper insight into fundamental brain function, and how it goes awry in disorders such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, where decision-making processes are altered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a new model in hand, Engel and her colleagues now plan to explore how different types of neurons, and the ways they connect, contribute to the diverse tuning and distinct phases of decision-making they observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every decision is unique,” Engel said. “But by digging down to the level of single trials and single neurons, we can start to make sense of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this decision-making and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2541531411141d6555574c4b4640514a4b0b404150" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Daniel Vahaba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://princeton.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Daniel Vahaba – Princeton University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09199-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The dynamics and geometry of choice in the premotor cortex&lt;/a&gt;” by Tatiana Engel et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dynamics and geometry of choice in the premotor cortex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain represents sensory variables in the coordinated activity of neural populations, in which tuning curves of single neurons define the geometry of the population code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the same coding principle holds for dynamic cognitive variables remains unknown because internal cognitive processes unfold with a unique time course on single trials observed only in the irregular spiking of heterogeneous neural populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show the existence of such a population code for the dynamics of choice formation in the primate premotor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed an approach to simultaneously infer population dynamics and tuning functions of single neurons to the population state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applied to spike data recorded during decision-making, our model revealed that populations of neurons encoded the same dynamic variable predicting choices, and heterogeneous firing rates resulted from the diverse tuning of single neurons to this decision variable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inferred dynamics indicated an attractor mechanism for decision computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results reveal a unifying geometric principle for neural encoding of sensory and dynamic cognitive variables.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 20:59:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE01QlJoR0ZuQmdSUG00Ym91VloxYkV3U0pNaHVNMmxIeXk1TmRSVTMzcTFRaFRYYXo3Rk9aYjU3Q3lONjBhcm1tcGNHXzJ6dUJMTXhzT2tQeDl0NTZvaGN1V0pFT0pjRnM5TF9IUVREZ3VpTzEtYmVBWXpTMA</guid></item><item><title>握力揭示早期精神病背后的大脑线索-神经科学新闻 | Grip Strength Reveals Brain Clues Behind Early Psychosis - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE91RTVGOXdkRC1CRnRpX3pNRmNfaXpuV3V4d185aEVxMWhGdlpNU0tiU1ducnBkYzZ4UVRINHBJT2RHS3lSZDB4ZGtaa0kzWDNDLVlFRGRBYzh5bzQ1YkthTllYVGdaRzd4WGhZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Psychosis may start not with hallucinations, but with subtle motor changes like reduced grip strength. A new study reveals that lower grip strength in people with early psychosis is linked to altered brain connectivity, particularly in networks that govern both movement and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes affect regions like the anterior cingulate cortex, sensorimotor cortex, and cerebellum, offering a more accessible way to detect and understand psychosis. The findings open the door to new interventions, from brain stimulation to physical training, that may strengthen these neural pathways and improve mental health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motor Clues:&lt;/strong&gt; Poor grip strength in early psychosis links to reduced brain connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Targets:&lt;/strong&gt; Disrupted communication in the default mode network may underlie both movement and mental symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Interventions:&lt;/strong&gt; Treatments like TMS or motor training could boost brain function and well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Indiana University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychosis often begins not with characteristic disturbances of the mind – delusions like paranoia or hallucinations – but with disturbances in the way we move our body. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For researchers like Indiana University Assistant Professor Alexandra Moussa-Tooks in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, these motor disturbances offer critical insights into the condition of psychosis itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111186"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a hand gripping a ball." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The analysis confirmed that participants with early psychosis had lower grip strength and well-being scores than healthy controls. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study published on June 25 in the&lt;em&gt; American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, senior-author Moussa-Tooks and first-author Heather Burrell Ward, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, explore one such motor ability – grip strength – to uncover the mechanisms linking motor disturbances to psychosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Moussa-Tooks explains: “Poor grip strength has been associated with many negative outcomes in a variety of people: lower well-being, higher risk of mortality, poor day-to-day functioning, poor quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Grip strength seems to capture that things are not going well. But it hasn’t been well studied in relation to brain function or early psychosis. Our study looks at how grip strength may be an important sign of brain and psychological health in early psychosis.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is the first to suggest that grip strength and overall well-being share common patterns of brain connectivity. It shows that impairment in grip strength and well-being may reflect alterations in what researchers call “resting-state functional connectivity,” a measure of brain network function that may be key to understanding psychosis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a novel neuroimaging analysis, Moussa-Tooks and her collaborators demonstrate that brain networks with important roles in both motor and cognitive function play key roles in gripping ability and mental well-being. Their findings lay the groundwork for interventions aimed at improving functioning and wellness in early psychosis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A unifying brain circuit explanation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s data came from the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis, a large initiative conducted from 2016 to 2020 across multiple sites, among them the IU School of Medicine. It included 89 individuals in the first five years of psychotic illness and 51 healthy controls for whom age- or medication-related motor decline could be ruled out.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis confirmed that participants with early psychosis had lower grip strength and well-being scores than healthy controls. These metrics related to three key brain regions —the anterior cingulate cortex, sensorimotor cortex, and cerebellum— each of which were shown to be connected to the default mode network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher grip strength and greater well-being correlated with greater connectivity between these regions and the default mode network.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying brain targets for new treatments  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings are particularly exciting because they identify potential brain targets for new treatments for psychosis,” Ward said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, both researchers see enormous potential in transcranial magnetic stimulation. If in psychosis there is poor communication within the default mode network, TMS is a non-invasive tool that can be used to directly increase that connectivity. Motor training, like exercise, to strengthen brain networks indirectly can offer another promising strategy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Grip strength and other motor functions,” Moussa-Tooks explains, “are easily assessed and more readily interpretable than complex tasks often used to study psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work is showing that these seemingly simple metrics can help us understanding disturbances not only in the motor system, but across complex brain systems that give rise to the complex symptoms we see in psychosis.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the following analogy, she suggests: “If psychosis is a house on fire, symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations are the smoke. In a fire you don’t target the smoke, you target the fire and its source. And yet, currently that’s not how we approach treatment for psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Motor disturbances help us get closer to identifying where the fire may have started and spread. They are more fundamental in the sense that they’re easier to link to different disturbances in the brain.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this new study researchers are getting closer to the fire. By drawing a line between motor function and mental health – from grip strength and well-being to patterns of brain connectivity with a key role in psychosis – they are mapping out new paths for understanding and treating an elusive disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychosis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#04766b7760616d7067446d712a616071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Liz Rosdeitcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://iu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Indiana University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Liz Rosdeitcher – Indiana University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.20240780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Grip Strength as a Marker of Resting-State Network Integrity and Well-Being in Early Psychosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Alexandra Moussa-Tooks et al. &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grip Strength as a Marker of Resting-State Network Integrity and Well-Being in Early Psychosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Objective:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychomotor function is a critical marker of risk and outcome of psychosis. Grip strength is one aspect of psychomotor function that is known to be linked to structural neural integrity and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study sought to determine whether grip strength is a marker of alterations in resting-state connectivity and well-being in psychotic disorders in order to further clarify the mechanisms by which psychosis phenomenology is related to psychomotor processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors analyzed resting-state functional MRI and grip strength in 89 individuals with early psychosis and 51 control subjects without psychiatric disorders from the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis. Participants ranged in age from 16 to 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using multivariate pattern analysis of whole-connectome data, the authors identified brain correlates of grip strength and then replicated this analysis using the NIH Toolbox well-being measures and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psychosis group exhibited reduced grip strength, well-being, and GAF scores compared to the control group. Grip strength was linked to resting-state connectivity in the sensorimotor cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum. Connectivity correlated with the default mode network (DMN) (r&lt;sub&gt;sensorimotor&lt;/sub&gt;=0.22, r&lt;sub&gt;cingulate&lt;/sub&gt;=0.30, r&lt;sub&gt;cerebellum&lt;/sub&gt;=0.24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the analysis was repeated for GAF and well-being, overlapping regions in the sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum were connected to the DMN and related to GAF (r&lt;sub&gt;sensorimotor&lt;/sub&gt;=0.17, r&lt;sub&gt;cerebellum&lt;/sub&gt;=0.28) and well-being (r&lt;sub&gt;sensorimotor&lt;/sub&gt;=0.16, r&lt;sub&gt;cerebellum&lt;/sub&gt;=0.16). Relationships were driven by the psychosis group for cerebellum and cingulate nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data-driven, connectome-wide analysis identified shared brain correlates of grip strength, overall function, and well-being in a sample of young adults with psychosis and healthy control subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that grip strength may be a marker of DMN connectivity, which may in turn be an important marker of overall health, even in young adult populations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 20:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE91RTVGOXdkRC1CRnRpX3pNRmNfaXpuV3V4d185aEVxMWhGdlpNU0tiU1ducnBkYzZ4UVRINHBJT2RHS3lSZDB4ZGtaa0kzWDNDLVlFRGRBYzh5bzQ1YkthTllYVGdaRzd4WGhZ</guid></item><item><title>FDA要求更新有关COVID疫苗罕见心脏病风险的警告-美联社新闻 | FDA requires updated warning about rare heart risk with COVID shots - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPdVFWMjJLTElqbkpWLWxVRDdEN0RxekFsU1BuMkVCZHhkWUJXRXJmYmZWbGxsTE4tREgybk0yeTFNZ00wNUJUbUtELWRzVFdlMEg4eTlxamNaNXJ1ZHlWQXF5elpnaTZwVkQxNWVNZ1VKSHF6eWdNRkNaNkptdlp2NkluNk95cEhITXVKSDdiblJZZ0dsQWdSOGxyYmhSQUZRcEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 20:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPdVFWMjJLTElqbkpWLWxVRDdEN0RxekFsU1BuMkVCZHhkWUJXRXJmYmZWbGxsTE4tREgybk0yeTFNZ00wNUJUbUtELWRzVFdlMEg4eTlxamNaNXJ1ZHlWQXF5elpnaTZwVkQxNWVNZ1VKSHF6eWdNRkNaNkptdlp2NkluNk95cEhITXVKSDdiblJZZ0dsQWdSOGxyYmhSQUZRcEE</guid></item><item><title>FDA要求更新有关COVID疫苗罕见心脏病风险的警告-雅虎 | FDA requires updated warning about rare heart risk with COVID shots - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxOejVGWjQwekQ0bVlLYnpOZndCTjF4OTM1OHJjaVhMazhna3dvakMyMG5ERktkb1V1UF94cjM0RHdya1ROYTREQ2g3RmtNQkp4RVdhNDlVOHJuaVEtYVFBY1g0aXRHaTBZd3g5WGJpVXl3dEo1Tm9yTmdOSEZWazZnZQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-food-and-drug-administration" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Food and Drug Administration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; said Wednesday it has expanded existing warnings on the two leading COVID-19 vaccines about a rare heart side effect mainly seen in young men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Myocarditis, a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-552859079506" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type of heart inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;type of heart inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that is usually mild, emerged as a complication after the first shots became widely available in 2021.

Conflict is another factor. The outbreak of civil war in Sudan in 2023 led to one key coverage measurement — the number of children receiving the first dose of the DTP vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis — falling from almost 90 percent to about half of that, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UJ3JMTH5QRBQ7JC4R7W7RWWB2Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Planned budget cuts to vaccines “are likely to disproportionately affect low-income and middle income countries,” the study said, but richer countries are also likely to be affected by higher costs caused by increasing outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EAW4OI45IJFUVG7N3Z56MDN5DM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study’s findings echo a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-04-2025-increases-in-vaccine-preventable-disease-outbreaks-threaten-years-of-progress--warn-who--unicef--gavi" target="_blank"&gt;warning this spring&lt;/a&gt; from the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who noted outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases were increasing around the world, “putting lives at risk and exposing countries to increased costs in treating diseases and responding to outbreaks.” He urged countries with limited resources to “invest in the highest-impact interventions — and that includes vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MEZQPBZHCZBPNMN4GTUSXQUVHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study, which was funded by the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, was published in the Lancet medical journal.
