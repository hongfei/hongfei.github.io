The gut microbiome of vaginally born babies tended to match that of their mothers, confirming that bacteria are passed mostly from the mother's gut, not her vagina. Meanwhile, babies born via C-section had more bacteria associated with hospital environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"&lt;i id="e.-faecalis" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;E. faecalis&lt;/i&gt; is a bacteria that's associated with opportunistic infection. So if your immune system is not working very well, it can cause disease," says Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The researchers found the differences in gut bacteria between vaginally-born and caesarean-delivered babies largely evened out by the time the infant turned one. However, there were signs that having good bacteria from day one gave babies a health advantage. The team tracked over 1,000 of the babies to see if any were admitted to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We were able to see that babies whose guts were dominated by &lt;i id="b.-longum" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B. longum&lt;/i&gt; were about &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(24)00340-9/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;half as likely&lt;/a&gt; to be admitted for a respiratory tract infection within the first two years of life, when compared to the &lt;i id="b.-brevae" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B. brevae&lt;/i&gt; babies and the &lt;i id="e.-faecalis" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;E. faecalis&lt;/i&gt; babies," says Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In other words, having &lt;i id="b.-longum" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B. longum&lt;/i&gt; seemed to protect some vaginally-born infants from respiratory conditions. It's possible that the absence of beneficial gut bacteria like &lt;i id="b.longum" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B.longum&lt;/i&gt; could explain why babies born via C-section have a slightly &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(24)00645-7/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;elevated risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing certain inflammatory conditions such as asthma, allergies, autoimmune disorders and obesity, although more work is needed to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 09:58:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQYm5BWS1rbUo3OXR5SnVNd2FWZ2ZPZzBfUUk4Y0l1U3hnd0tBSDRDbTVkbm00Y0g2bEJNSEJOOTZndmdmVzFzQUtNVkhuRnhtVko1bVR1M0JGcHE2WjZLdjI2a1E3WG1xZlVEdG5SRUtrcEdIMFZDMndRMl9tWndvN1JkSDJLWE1TbjQtMFRtbV9PUmdlRlRJVVVRZFpBU2JLa0dFRUFhQVo</guid></item><item><title>肿瘤学家说，肺癌不仅仅是一种吸烟者疾病，并在这个宣传月的早期迹象中发出警告-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/lung-cancer-isnt-just-a-smokers-disease-say-oncologists-and-warn-on-early-signs-this-awareness-month/articleshow/125074035.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;November marks Lung Cancer Awareness Month, a time to pause, breathe, and talk about one of the world’s most serious yet misunderstood cancers. It’s not just a “smoker’s disease” non-smokers are increasingly being diagnosed too, thanks to air pollution, passive smoke, and genetic factors. The scary part? Early symptoms often feel harmless, a lingering cough, breathlessness, or fatigue that most people brush off. But catching it early makes all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month is about spreading awareness, encouraging regular screenings like low-dose CT scans for those at risk, and reminding everyone that quitting smoking really does save lives. Even better, lung health can bounce back with time, good nutrition, and clean air habits. So if you’ve been ignoring that cough or skipping your health checks, maybe November’s the perfect time to start paying attention,because your lungs are literally your life’s breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;8 yoga poses to improve lung capacity and strengthen respiratory muscles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We at TOI spoke to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr Anadi Pachaury&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Associate Director &amp;amp; Unit Head, Surgical Oncology, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Shalimar Bagh and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Chairman, Surgical Oncology, Andromeda Cancer Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the early warning signs and symptoms of lung cancer that people often overlook?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr Anadi Pachaury: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people dismiss the early signs of lung cancer because they resemble common chest or seasonal issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cough that lingers for weeks, mild chest discomfort, hoarseness, or breathlessness on routine activities can all be early indicators. Some may notice fatigue or recurrent chest infections. Even small traces of blood in sputum should never be ignored and need medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early stages, lung cancer is often hard to detect as the symptoms are considered to be minor. The symptoms include a cough which persists for more than three weeks, blood in sputum, shortness of breath without explanation, frequent chest infections, pain in the chest or back, changes in the voice, loss of weight, or tiredness. These symptoms should always be taken seriously, particularly by smokers or those living in polluted areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does smoking increase the risk of lung cancer, and are non-smokers equally vulnerable?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Both the experts say:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cigarette smoke contains thousands of harmful chemicals — many of which are carcinogens that damage DNA in lung cells. The longer and heavier a person smokes, the greater their chance of developing lung cancer. But non-smokers aren’t completely safe — prolonged exposure to air pollution, secondhand smoke, or genetic factors can also trigger cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the most effective ways to reduce the risk of developing lung cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most powerful step to prevent lung cancer is to quit smoking completely—there’s no safe limit. Avoid secondhand smoke, reduce exposure to air pollution and workplace chemicals, and keep your home well-ventilated. Use air purifiers, clean-burning fuels, and wear protective masks on high-pollution days. People with a history of heavy smoking should discuss annual low-dose CT scans with their doctor for early detection. Regular health checkups and vaccinations for flu and pneumonia further support long-term lung health. Striking out smoking and improving air quality together create a strong defense against lung damage and cancer," advise the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does diet, exercise, and overall lifestyle influence lung health and cancer prevention?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr Anadi Pachaury: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good nutrition and regular exercise make a real difference. Foods rich in antioxidants—like leafy greens, fruits, and nuts—help protect cells from damage. Physical activity keeps the lungs strong and supports better oxygen flow. Avoiding processed foods, alcohol, and polluted environments also goes a long way in preserving lung health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life that is well-balanced is the main factor to lung immunity. Include antioxidant-rich food such as fruits, green leafy vegetables, turmeric, and nuts in your diet and at the same time cut down on fried or processed foods. Dedicate 30 to 45 minutes for daily exercise which will increase your lung capacity. If you are at a healthy weight, restrict alcohol intake, and practice relaxation methods and deep-breathing exercises such as pranayama, then your lungs will be stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What should ex-smokers do to lower their long-term lung cancer risk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do not start smoking again and have yearly lung check-ups. People between 50-80 years old with a history of heavy smoking may consider getting low-dose CT scans. Along with this, eating healthy, staying active, and avoiding exposure to pollutants and smoke from others are some of the measures that can be taken. These actions will bring down the risk of lung cancer in ex-smokers and promote good respiratory health," recommends Dr Goel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even after quitting, it’s important to stay committed to a healthy lifestyle. Eat well, exercise regularly, and go for periodic health checks. Discuss lung screening with your doctor, especially if you smoked for several years. The body continues to heal over time—lung function and risk both improve steadily after quitting," advises Dr Pachaury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the biggest myths or misconceptions about lung cancer that you’d like to correct?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common myth is that lung cancer only affects smokers, but anyone can develop it — though smoking remains the leading cause. Non-smokers face risks from air pollution, secondhand smoke, and genetic factors. Another misconception is that quitting smoking doesn’t help once damage is done, which is completely false. The benefits of quitting begin within weeks, and the risk keeps dropping every year. Early detection offers the best chance of cure, and newer therapies continue to improve survival. Persistent cough or breathlessness should never be ignored, and no herbal remedy can reverse the DNA damage caused by smoking, say the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwJBVV95cUxNY2RQVFd1ZVlzdHRSQTQ4TEJjbGQzLW5QWUd2TFNLSWh1Tm5sUzloVllLUmFKTUFpeEF3RkVSVkM1WWZ0THBKOTdNNWNoOGZySDREejBpVXdYV1ZKUkNMeWpGZ2NsWHJxWng4QnJBWWpsbXg5cFdfZzlxUzlfdVVQMFNfbVQ1Q01kaDFHZk5ITG5OYl94UHI3Z0g0c2ZlNkNTVzVHWEFtcHBnZVYxQ3htVnd3YWhDdjgyclRLLTEyUWJBbERWWEZRMnJic2kwdWZaNC1DNFZsam41TmdURHNTM2RpSG5tbWhGb01yeGwyR2M3NlhfZVFDTmxSeG5FRGROanNqdzhTbTdicHdlblp2WFFlUkxsVmxDNERhcnczT0FEZEFQZmtF</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，分区可能是您大脑的冲洗周期- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/zoning-out-may-be-your-brains-rinse-cycle-study-finds</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We're all familiar with the feeling of zoning out, especially when &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-dangers-of-sleep-deprivation-are-very-real-expert-warns"&gt;we're sleep-deprived&lt;/a&gt;. A new study suggests these brief wanderings of attention are our brain's attempts to catch up on maintenance that usually happens while we snooze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), used brain measurements taken by both electroencephalogram (EEG) caps and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"&gt;functional magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fMRI) scanners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Periods of zoning out – or "attentional failures", in the words of the study – were accompanied by a wave of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-vital-fluid-protects-your-most-important-organ-what-happens-if-it-fails"&gt;cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt; (CSF) flowing out of the brain, before it returned a second or two later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fragments-of-bacteria-in-our-gut-may-lull-our-brains-to-sleep-at-night"&gt;Fragments of Bacteria in Our Gut May Lull Our Brains to Sleep at Night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patterns matched the waves of CSF that usually happen during &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-stage-of-sleep-seems-critical-for-reducing-risk-of-dementia"&gt;deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;. The thinking is that this nightly fluid flow helps wash away waste products that build up during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you don't sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn't see them," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/your-brain-without-sleep-1029"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; MIT neuroscientist Laura Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, they come with an attentional trade-off, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179946" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179946" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CerebralSpinalFluidFlowWhenAwake-642x314.png" alt="A graph with two lines, one red and the other blue, charting fluid flows in the sleep-derived versus well-rested brain.

(Yang et al., Nat. Neurosci., 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study participants were each tested twice: after a night of restful sleep and after a night in the lab with no sleep at all. Unsurprisingly, their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superager-brains-defy-cognitive-decline-we-finally-know-their-secret"&gt;cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt; during the study tests was generally worse when they hadn't gotten any shut-eye the night before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While zoning out occasionally happened &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-explain-what-a-good-nights-sleep-actually-looks-like"&gt;after a full night's slumber&lt;/a&gt;, it was much more common after the participants had stayed awake all night. It's almost as if the brain is trying to catch up with a burst of microsleep, at the temporary cost of your mind's focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179832" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179832" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CSFFlow.jpg" alt="Brain scan charts" class="wp-image-179832 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CSFFlow.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CSFFlow-600x493.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179832" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at CSF flow and periods of zoning out ("omissions") after a full night of sleep and after a night of no sleep. Higher flows were recorded when reaction times slowed down (C; data from one test run is shown). (Yang et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Neurosci.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/your-brain-without-sleep-1029"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Zinong Yang, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your brain's fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that sleep is absolutely essential to our health and well-being. Missing out on these periods of rest increases &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sleep-deprivation-can-be-deadly-here-s-what-sleeping-less-than-7-hours-per-night-does-to-your-body-and-brain"&gt;our risk of disease&lt;/a&gt;, causes impairments in certain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-found-an-alarming-pattern-in-the-brains-of-sleep-deprived-kids"&gt;parts of the brain&lt;/a&gt;, and changes our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/being-sleep-deprived-actually-changes-the-way-we-see-other-people"&gt;perspective on the world&lt;/a&gt;.

The Virginia Department of Health is also reporting significant increases in emergency department and urgent care visits for hand, foot and mouth disease. Compared with previous years, in Virginia and West Virginia, there has been a notable increase in reported outbreaks, with schools and day care centers accounting for the majority of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;SEE ALSO:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/150-unvaccinated-students-south-carolina-quarantining-measles-exposure/17998234/"&gt; Over 150 unvaccinated students in South Carolina quarantining after measles exposure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;What is hand, foot and mouth disease, and what causes it?

What steps can families take to help prevent infection?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University, previously served as Baltimore's health commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN: &lt;/strong&gt;What is hand, foot and mouth disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease is a highly contagious viral illness that primarily affects infants and young children. It's caused by a group of viruses known as enteroviruses, most commonly coxsackievirus A16. It is not the same as foot-and-mouth disease, which affects farm animals like cattle, sheep, pigs and goats and does not infect humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease gets its name from the small blister-like sores it causes on the hands and feet and inside the mouth. While the illness can be uncomfortable, it is generally mild and resolves on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN: &lt;/strong&gt;How is it spread, and who is most at risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease spreads very easily through close personal contact and contaminated surfaces. A person can become infected after being exposed to droplets released when someone with the illness coughs, sneezes or talks. It can also spread through touching an infected person, such as during hugging, kissing, or sharing cups and utensils.&lt;br class=" "&gt;The virus is present in stool as well, so changing diapers or helping a sick child in the bathroom can lead to infection if hands aren't washed thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It can also spread when someone touches objects or surfaces like toys or doorknobs that have the virus on them, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth. Rarely, people can become infected by swallowing contaminated recreational water, such as from a pool that hasn't been properly treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Young children are most at risk because their immune systems are still developing, and they are more likely to struggle with personal hygiene and share toys and have close contact with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; What are the symptoms, and how long do they last?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;The first sign of the disease is usually a fever, followed by a sore throat and a general feeling of being unwell. These flu-like symptoms typically start three to five days after catching the virus. A day or two later, small painful spots can develop inside the mouth, often on the tongue, gums or inner cheeks. These spots can turn into tiny blisters or ulcers, making it uncomfortable for children to eat or drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Around the same time, a rash can appear on the hands and feet, and sometimes on the buttocks, legs or arms. The rash may look like flat red spots or small bumps that can form blisters, but it typically doesn't itch.&lt;br class=" "&gt;Some children have the mouth sores without the rash, while others have the rash without any sores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Most cases are mild and clear up on their own in about a week to 10 days. During that time, it's important to keep children well hydrated, since mouth pain can make them less willing to drink fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Can adults also get it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, although it's much more common in young children. Because most people are first exposed during childhood, adults often have some immunity. Still, anyone who hasn't been infected before or whose immune system is weakened can catch it through close contact with someone who is sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;When teenagers or adults do get hand, foot and mouth disease, symptoms are usually mild or may not appear at all. Some adults may have only a sore throat or mild rash without the typical mouth sores or blisters. However, they can still spread the virus to others, including young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; How is hand, foot and mouth disease diagnosed and treated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Health care providers usually diagnose the disease based on the characteristic symptoms and recent exposure to other sick children. A physical exam is typically enough to confirm the diagnosis. In rare cases, if the illness looks unusual or severe, the clinician may collect a throat swab or stool sample to test for the specific virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There is no specific medicine that cures hand, foot and mouth disease. Because it's caused by a virus, antibiotics do not help. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can reduce fever and mouth pain, and cool, soft foods or cold drinks can make eating and drinking more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Staying hydrated is the most important part of care, since mouth sores can make swallowing painful and dehydration can develop quickly in young children. Most cases clear up on their own without complications, but parents should contact a doctor if a child cannot keep fluids down, has a high fever lasting more than a few days or seems unusually drowsy or irritable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN: &lt;/strong&gt;Should parents keep children home from school or day care?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Because hand, foot and mouth disease tends to be mild, children don't need to stay home for the entire illness. The guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is that they can return to school or day care once they no longer have a fever, feel well enough to take part in normal activities, and can manage any mouth sores without excessive drooling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Parents should also check with their school or day care, since specific policies may vary. The CDC cautions that in some situations, such as during an outbreak, the local health department may ask families to keep affected children home temporarily to help limit further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there steps families can take to help prevent infection?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Regular and thorough handwashing is one of the most effective protective measures. Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or changing a diaper, before preparing or eating food, and after blowing the nose or coughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Covering coughs and sneezes, ideally using a disposable tissue or the crook of the elbow, can help stop the spread of virus-laden droplets. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects. And people should also avoid close personal contact with infected individuals. This means no sharing of drinks, utensils, toothbrushes or towels, and keeping hugs or kisses to a minimum if someone is ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;The-CNN-Wire &amp;amp; 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

"One of my gym friends is on [weight loss] jabs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Baxi says he refused, asking him what he would do after losing 10kg on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Stop, and the weight comes back. Keep going, and without exercise you'll start losing muscle instead. These medicines aren't a substitute for a proper diet or lifestyle change," he told him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Such conversations are becoming increasingly common as demand for weight-loss drugs explodes in urban India - a country with the world's second-largest number of overweight adults and more than 77 million people with Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Originally developed to treat diabetes, these drugs are now being hailed as game changers for weight loss, offering results that few previous treatments could match. Yet their growing popularity has also raised difficult questions - about the need for medical supervision, the risks of misuse and the blurred line between treatment and lifestyle enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"These are the most powerful weight-loss drugs we've ever seen. Many such drugs have come and gone, but nothing compares to these," says Anoop Misra, who heads Delhi's Fortis-C-DOC Centre of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Two new drugs dominate India's fast-growing weight-loss market. One is semaglutide, sold by Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk as Rybelsus (oral) and Wegovy (injectable) - while Ozempic (injectable) has been approved for diabetes in India but is not yet available for obesity. The other is tirzepatide, marketed by American drugmaker Eli Lilly as Mounjaro, primarily for diabetes but increasingly used for weight loss in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Both belong to a class known as GLP-1 drugs, which mimic a natural hormone that regulates hunger. By slowing digestion and acting on the brain's appetite centres, they make people feel full faster and stay full longer. Taken once a week, most of these drugs are self-injected in the arm, thigh or stomach. They curb cravings - and in Mounjaro's case, also boost metabolism and energy balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/24a7/live/e2c24190-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/24a7/live/e2c24190-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/24a7/live/e2c24190-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/24a7/live/e2c24190-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/24a7/live/e2c24190-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/24a7/live/e2c24190-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/24a7/live/e2c24190-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/24a7/live/e2c24190-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Close up of a woman's hands holding a weight loss injection pen.

Prolonged use without exercise or strength training can also strip away muscle along with fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Also, not everyone responds to GLP-1 drugs, and most plateau after losing about 15% of their body weight. Side effects range from nausea and diarrhoea to rarer risks such as gallstones, pancreatitis and muscle loss. India's high-carb, low-protein diet already fuels sarcopenic obesity - the loss of muscle alongside fat gain - and weight loss without adequate protein or exercise can make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"With all the media hype and social media buzz, these drugs have become something of a craze among affluent Indians eager to shed a few kilos," says Dr Baxi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The frenzy, a Delhi-based physician recalls, was evident even at a recent medical conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Three months after the launch of a new drug, I'd treated about a hundred patients. A colleague said he'd done over a thousand - most using imported jabs bought on the black market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;India's anti-obesity drug market has surged from $16m in 2021 to nearly $100m today - a more than sixfold jump in five years, according to Pharmarack, a research firm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Novo Nordisk leads the market with its semaglutide brands, with Rybelsus alone accounting for nearly two-thirds of the market since its 2022 launch, according to the firm. Eli Lilly's tirzepatide (marketed as Mounjaro), launched earlier this year, had become India's second-bestselling branded drug by September, according to Pharmarack. Each monthly injectable pen - four weekly doses - of these drugs costs between 14,000-27,000 rupees ($157–300), steep for most Indians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Prashanth Vishwanathan/Bloomberg via Getty Images A Public Health Foundation of India worker conducts a blood glucose test for a patient during a free door-to-door screening program funded by Eli Lilly &amp;amp; Co. at a home in the farming village of Thana kalan, Haryana, India, on Thursday, July 13, 2017.

Come March, the patent for semaglutide - the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy - expires here, potentially unleashing a flood of cheaper generics and making them more accessible. Jefferies, an investment bank, calls it a "magic pill moment" for India, predicting the semaglutide market could reach $1bn with the right pricing, uptake, and government incentives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"What we have heard is that nearly a dozen companies are already ready with generic versions of Rybelsus, the oral drug," says Sheetal Sapale, vice-president at Pharmarack. "But as affordability improves, the risk of misuse rises too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Doctors tell stories of patients being put on high dosage of weight-loss drugs by gym trainers, dieticians and beauty clinics with no authority to prescribe them. Some online pharmacies are delivering drugs after a cursory phone consultation in the absence of a prescription. Beauticians offer "bridal packages" promising rapid slimming before the big day. There are fears of spurious medicines flooding the market. Federal minister Jitendra Singh has &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2157298" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;"advised caution"&lt;/a&gt; on the new drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"One patient asked me if these new medicines could help his daughter lose seven kilos before her wedding - in three months," recalls Dr Bhaumik Kamdar, a Mumbai-based chest physician. "He wanted to know if they really work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One challenge in India, doctors say, is the way people perceive obesity - and how that shapes attitudes toward weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Most don't realise that obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease," says Dr Muffazal Lakhdawala, a Mumbai-based bariatric surgeon.  "Many people with chronic obesity try crash diets, lose some weight, then regain even more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Here, if you're overweight, people assume you're well-fed and affluent. We've gone so far in avoiding the elephant in the room that we've normalised it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Obesity, doctors warn, is a gateway to a host of diseases. "It's linked to at least 20 cancers, infertility, osteoarthritis and fatty liver - now one of the leading causes of cirrhosis," says Dr Lakhdawala. Yet, despite it affecting nearly one in eight people globally, there's still no universal consensus on how to define or classify obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The arrival of these drugs has changed the conversation - obesity is now being treated as a disease, not just a lifestyle issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Doctors across specialities are now turning to weight-loss drugs for more than just obesity or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Two men performing squats with dumbbells in an open outdoor environment.

From just 200 procedures in 2004, the number soared to 40,000 in 2022 - a 200-fold rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Surgeons like Dr Lakdawala now run multidisciplinary programmes where patients on weight-loss drugs are first guided by endocrinologists, nutritionists, and psychologists for three to six months. "We don't hand out drugs casually," he says. "Those who don't respond to the drugs or have severe obesity are then considered for surgery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;His message to the growing number of urban Indians seeking quick fixes is blunt: "Don't use the drugs for cosmetic weight loss - use it for life-threatening weight gain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And for those chasing quick fixes to shed just five or 10kg?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He has simpler advice: "Cut out sugar - it's the biggest evil.

			&lt;p&gt;Specially engineered 'young' immune cells could help to reverse the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-critical-age-when-your-thinking-begins-to-decline"&gt;effects of aging&lt;/a&gt; and the damage to brain cells caused by diseases such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="179027" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new study in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their natural state, these immune cells are known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononuclear_phagocyte_system"&gt;mononuclear phagocytes&lt;/a&gt;, and they flow around the body, cleaning up waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we get older, however, these immune-cell cleaners &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2020.12.003"&gt;get a bit sloppy&lt;/a&gt;, clearing away less cellular debris and triggering more inflammation than before. Inflammation and protein aggregation are features of many age-related diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-signal-hidden-in-the-brain-may-reveal-alzheimers-years-in-advance"&gt;including Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So researchers from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in the US produced replacement squads of mononuclear phagocytes, using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell"&gt;human induced pluripotent stem cells&lt;/a&gt; – starter cells that can be reprogrammed into many different cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-and-cancer-may-soon-be-treated-with-sounds-we-cant-hear"&gt;Alzheimer's And Cancer May Soon Be Treated With Sounds We Can't Hear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previous studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mice-hippocampus-enzyme-discovery-anti-aging-therapy"&gt;transfusions of blood&lt;/a&gt; or plasma from young mice improved cognitive decline in older mice, but that is difficult to translate into a therapy," &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/young-immune-cells-could-treat-alzheimers-aging-symptoms/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Clive Svendsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our approach was to use young immune cells that we can manufacture in the lab – and we found that they have beneficial effects in both aging mice and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179030" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LearningTask.jpg" alt="Immune cells graph" class="wp-image-179030 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LearningTask.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LearningTask-600x608.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179030" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Older mice injected with 'young' immune cells (Aging iMP) performed as well as younger animals (injected with saline as a control) on novel object location tasks.

They help reduce damage and waste in the brain, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54779-w"&gt;become depleted&lt;/a&gt; in older brains and the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-autopsies-revealed-a-potential-culprit-behind-alzheimers"&gt;those of people with Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another observed benefit was an increase in the number of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossy_fiber_(hippocampus)"&gt;mossy cells&lt;/a&gt; that help the brain's memory control center, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;, function properly. Like microglia, these mossy cells can be hit by old age and Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers of mossy cells decline with aging and Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/young-immune-cells-could-treat-alzheimers-aging-symptoms/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist and lead author Alexandra Moser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did not see that decline in mice receiving young mononuclear phagocytes, and we believe this may be responsible for some of the memory improvements that we observed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers originally hypothesized that mononuclear phagocytes could be part of the reason that blood plasma and bone marrow transfusions have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.3569"&gt;the rejuvenating effects&lt;/a&gt; they do, and that idea was supported by the results here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the engineered immune cells that Moser and colleagues injected into mice didn't appear to reach the animals' brains, so the researchers figured the observed effects must be down to something produced by fitter, stronger mononuclear phagocytes circulating in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 'young' cells may have released anti-aging proteins or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_vesicle"&gt;tiny parcels involved in cell-cell communication&lt;/a&gt;, called extracellular vesicles, that made their way to the brain, reducing inflammation and boosting the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;New Alzheimer's Treatment Clears Plaques From Brains of Mice Within Hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that most of the benefits observed here were in the older mice, not the mice engineered to display signs of Alzheimer's disease. There was also plenty of Alzheimer's-related brain damage, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;amyloid-beta protein&lt;/a&gt; buildup, that wasn't repaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-brains-develop-in-unique-ways-that-explain-some-mysteries-left-by-mice-models"&gt;no guarantee we'll see the same effects&lt;/a&gt; in human brains either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite those limitations, the early signs of this approach are promising. If derived from a patient's own cells, engineered mononuclear phagocytes could alleviate some of the drawbacks of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-new-blood-group-after-a-50-year-mystery"&gt;blood plasma&lt;/a&gt; transfusions and bone marrow transplants, so there's plenty of potential for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings show that short-term treatment improved cognition and brain health, making them a promising candidate to address age- and Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive decline," &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/young-immune-cells-could-treat-alzheimers-aging-symptoms/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Cedars-Sinai Medical Center neuropathologist Jeffrey Golden, who wasn't directly involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202417848"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They just told me I have stage 4 pancreatic cancer.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three short weeks later, Mark lost a very short battle with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="YouTubeEmbed_youTubeEmbed__ygKv1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The silent killer shows very few symptoms before diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would say maybe 2-3 weeks prior to diagnosis.  His acid reflux had gotten tremendously more aggressive," Lynita said.   "He was belching more.  He had fatigue.  Then, like a week or two prior, we noticed bloating in his stomach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had no clue it would literally be three weeks from the time he was diagnosed to the time that he passed," Lynita said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO: &lt;a href="https://wset.com/news/local/mark-spain-beloved-abc13-anchor-and-community-figure-dies-after-battle-with-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Spain, beloved ABC13 anchor and community figure, dies after battle with cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer is rare; just 1.6% of us are at risk of being diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you don’t often see symptoms early on, according to Centra oncologist Dr. Susannah Cooper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_imageEmbed__5mYLo"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mark Spain with his longtime anchor partners, Danner Evans and George Flickinger." class="ImageEmbed_image__qZBo_" src="/resources/media2/16x9/1920/986/0x316/90/60c63b2f-9f81-4ffa-bf2b-db149c68e756-thumbnail_IMG_2085.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageEmbed_caption__gAtoE"&gt;Mark Spain with his longtime anchor partners, Danner Evans and George Flickinger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think something that's really important to remember for pancreatic cancer or anything is that you really have to listen to your body," Cooper said. "I wouldn't ignore any symptoms.  Especially symptoms that persist."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to symptoms like sudden weight loss, abdominal pain, clay-colored bowels or chronic diarrhea, jaundice, or yellowing of the skin or eyes, fatigue and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a family history of pancreatic cancer, genetic counseling can be a tool for early detection and treatment, according to Kelsey Newell, a genetic counselor with Centra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ideally, genetic testing would be offered to those patients very shortly after their diagnosis so we can try to get a better understanding of any genetic mutations they carry that can help us be better informed of their treatment plan," Newell said.  "And identify targeted options for their therapy.  Also, provide that risk information to their family members."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgery to remove the cancer and chemotherapy can help survival rates, but only 15-20% of cases are diagnosed at an early enough stage to be treated before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even when I started in oncology, we had very little treatments for pancreatic cancer," said Dr. Cooper ."Over the last 5-10 years, we've gotten better and better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooper said they've come a long way in developing innovative ways to help survival rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We actually have medications that can block those mutations and work specifically to attack your tumor," Cooper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Kunk, an oncologist at UVA's cancer center, said cancer vaccines are also in clinical trials right now to help cure more patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having those patients undergo the same chemotherapy and then injecting a personalized cancer vaccine as well as an immune therapy medication to help rev up one’s immune system  to recognize those cancer proteins and mount a response to them and go after and kill all of them," Kunk explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer you should consider: cigarette smoking, obesity, physical inactivity and chronic pancreatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to your doctor about potentially being screened if you are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_imageEmbed__5mYLo"&gt;&lt;img alt="Anchor Mark Spain with his family (Credit: Mark Spain, ABC13)" class="ImageEmbed_image__qZBo_" src="/resources/media/e72c0a07-da0d-430a-b2ed-bb0cb87f15ff-large16x9_AnchorMarkSpain2.png?1652040520167"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageEmbed_caption__gAtoE"&gt;Anchor Mark Spain with his family (Credit: Mark Spain, ABC13)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynita doesn't know when Mark's cancer started--just that his symptoms presented too late in the game to offer any chance of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was one of the most aggressive cases they had seen in a while," Spain said.

Reporting in the journal Neurology Open Access, the team also warned that people with&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;both gum disease and cavities are at an 86 per cent greater risk of a stroke compared with those who have good dental habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/flossing-your-teeth-once-a-week-cuts-risk-of-stroke-by-one-fifth-d8lcqbb3q" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flossing your teeth once a week ‘cuts risk of stroke by one fifth’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The latest study monitored 5,986 adults in their fifties and sixties, none of whom had suffered a stroke when the investigation started, over 20 years. After accounting for variables such as age, body mass index and smoking, which all affect oral health, they found that those who visited their dentist regularly were 81 per cent less likely to have the gum disease and cavities tied to serious cardiovascular events, such as fatal heart disease and stroke, which cuts blood supply to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“This study reinforces the idea that taking care of your teeth and gums isn’t just about your smile; it could help protect your brain,” said Souvik Sen, a professor of neurology and lead author of the paper. “People with signs of gum disease or cavities should seek treatment not just to preserve their teeth, but potentially to reduce stroke risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Taking good care of your teeth could even reduce your risk of dementia. A study in Neurology found gum disease and tooth loss were tied to shrinkage in the hippocampus, the part of the brain that plays a role in memory and Alzheimer’s disease. There’s evidence, too, that the delicate bacterial balance in the mouth, known as the oral microbiome, may be implicated in memory loss and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In a study of 115 midlifers published this year&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Anne Corbett, a professor of dementia research at the University of Exeter, found that certain types of bacteria in the mouth are associated with better memory, focus and attention, while others are linked to poor brain health and dementia. In future, she says, it could lead to the development of DIY tests to detect early signs that someone is at elevated risk of cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/the-foods-to-eat-and-avoid-for-maintaining-healthy-teeth-mpbsw2jq8" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The foods to eat and the ones to avoid for healthy teeth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“The potential for profiling dementia risk through at-home sampling is exciting,” Corbett says. “It is possible that the [oral] microbiome could form part of a battery of tests that would be used for this purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Oral hygiene — brushing twice a day and using floss or interdental brushes — remains the most important step, but thinking beyond that with steps that can improve our teeth and gums is increasingly considered a powerful way to protect against disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“People see their general health as separate from their oral health,” Sikka says. “They don’t see the mouth as connected to the body, yet the mouth-body connection is extremely strong.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Here’s how you can improve the health of your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Make sure you get plenty of omega-3 fats in your diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id="3.13"&gt;&lt;div id="30c4c9d4-a187-47cf-ba51-f1240d283fb5"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Omega-3 fats found in oily fish such as salmon have anti-inflammatory effects on the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;We are all encouraged to eat more fatty fish for general health, but many of us don’t realise that the benefits of the essential healthy omega-3 oils they contain extend to improvements in our oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Omega-3 fats found in oily fish such as salmon, sardines and mackerel have anti-inflammatory effects on the body,” Shahid says. “Some studies show that when people with gum disease take omega-3s alongside dental treatment, their gums heal a little better.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;One recent investigation in the journal Scientific Reports suggested that combining omega-3 supplementation with regular exercise had a potent effect on lowering inflammation and helping the immune system to fight off chronic tooth root infections. It also helped to protect teeth from bone loss. The NHS recommends we eat at least one portion of oily fish a week. “Other good sources of omega-3 fats include flaxseed and walnuts,” Shahid says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Take a daily beetroot shot and eat your leafy greens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Some beneficial oral bacteria are known to play a key role in turning nitrate to nitric oxide, which has been shown in numerous studies to relax and widen blood vessels and improve blood flow around the body, including to the brain. Research by Anni Vanhatalo, professor in the faculty of health and life sciences at the University of Exeter, and Corbett has shown that eating plenty of nitrate-rich foods, including beetroot, can help with that process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In ongoing studies looking at the effects on oral health of taking a daily beetroot shot for 12 weeks Vanhatalo and Corbett have found that nitrate supplementation causes changes in mouth bacteria that are associated with healthier blood vessels and brain function as we age. They have also seen that levels of many harmful species of bacteria linked to inflammation decrease when beetroot shots are consumed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“We have shown that chronic nitrate supplementation [with beetroot shots] increases the proportion of nitrite-producing oral bacteria,” Vanhatalo says. “This change is particularly beneficial in older people because as we age, our ability to produce nitric oxide via alternative pathways decreases.” Beetroot shots are one option, but leafy greens such as spinach, rocket and other salad leaves are also good sources of dietary nitrate. “We know that a nitrate-rich diet such as the Mediterranean diet or Dash diet is an effective intervention to reduce the proportion of potentially harmful oral bacteria,” Vanhatalo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Regularly exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Staying fit has benefits for your oral health, as a recent review in the Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care demonstrated. Dental researchers looked at the effects of regular intense physical exercise — running, cycling, swimming and competitive sports — and found that the physically active “have lower levels of inflammatory biological markers, which is linked to better oral health”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;They also revealed that regular exercise has a positive effect on salivary antigens, substances in saliva that can trigger a positive immune response, as well as improved oral muscle strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Exercise improves blood flow, lowers levels of inflammation in the body that exacerbate gum disease, and helps control conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure that can make gum problems worse,” Shahid says. “While a workout in the gym won’t clean your teeth, staying active supports the gums and tissues that keep them in place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more expert advice on healthy living, fitness and wellbeing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Get plenty of fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Few of us get the recommended 30g of fibre a day that the NHS says we need for good health. We tend to think of fibre as improving our gut health and digestion, but its effects are far-reaching and by increasing our intake with more wholegrains, fruit and vegetables, we may inadvertently boost the health of our teeth and gums. A review by dental experts from Australia, New Zealand and India found that people who consumed 22-30g of fibre daily had less swelling of the gums, less plaque build-up and stronger tissues surrounding the teeth. It suggests “a fibre-rich daily diet may offer promise as a complementary approach for the prevention and management of periodontal diseases”, the researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Crunchy foods such as celery, raw carrots and peppers promote oral health not just because of the immune enhancing antioxidants they contain, but because they physically scrub the teeth as you chew them. Think of them as nature’s own interdental brushes, Sikka says. “All high-fibre foods act a bit like a natural cleanser as they rub against your teeth when you chew,” he says. “In addition, the chewing they require stimulates saliva production, which, in conjunction with good brushing and flossing habits, helps to remove plaque from the teeth.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Eat cheese after a meal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id="3.33"&gt;&lt;div id="f2f1573e-c34a-417a-b1f3-38a2d47f51b0"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Cheese helps to neutralise acid levels in the mouth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Cheese is good news for your oral health. “It is not only rich in calcium and phosphorus, which strengthen your tooth enamel, but cheese also helps to neutralise acid levels in the mouth,” Sikka says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Consuming a small piece of cheese after eating acidic foods or drinks — ultra-processed foods and fizzy drinks — can help to raise pH levels in the mouth, reducing levels of bacteria that over a long term can lead to decay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In a small trial at Western Kentucky University researchers gave participants 28g of mild cheddar 60 seconds after they had sipped some cola. Tests showed that the cheese helped to “provide a protective shield around the teeth that fights the release of acids”, the researchers wrote. Cheese also increases the flow of saliva, preventing bacteria from sticking to tooth surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Consider a deep-cleaning treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Data from the latest Adult Oral Health Survey commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care suggests that in England 19 per cent of adults and up to 28 per cent of those aged 55-64 said they had been told they had gum disease. Gum disease can be treated on the NHS — national guidelines include deep cleaning under local anaesthesia as part of the programme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Marco Orlandi, honorary associate professor at the UCL Eastman Dental Institute, recently published findings of a two-year clinical trial in the&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;European Heart Journal that found that this type of deep cleaning can reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease by 10 per cent each year compared with those who underwent a routine scale and polish. By reducing the amount of gum inflammation and bacteria entering the bloodstream, the deep cleaning helped to slow the thickening of the carotid arteries, the blood vessels supplying oxygen to the brain, face and neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Our trial did not include measures of cognitive function,” Orlandi says. “But it is plausible that arterial changes could support a modulation of the risk of neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

In severe cases, it can lead to abscesses, perforation, or bowel obstruction, which could require surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age for developing diverticulitis is over 50, with studies showing mean ages of around 52 to 64 for diagnosed cases. But trends could be shifting, the new study shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From looking at more &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.lww.com/dcrjournal/abstract/2025/05000/national_trends_in_hospital_admissions,.13.aspx"&gt;than 5.2 million&lt;/a&gt; hospitalizations included in the National Inpatient Sample, the researchers found a troubling surge in severe diverticulitis cases among Americans younger than 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that the proportion of younger patients admitted with complicated diverticulitis rose from 18.5 percent to 28.2 percent, a 52 percent relative increase over the 15-year period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, roughly 16 percent of the 5.2 million patients hospitalized for diverticulitis in that timeframe were under 50, classifying them as early-onset cases. Past research suggests the Western diet, with processed foods and a high red meat consumption, could be to blame for the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Diverticulitis is the inflammation or infection of small pouches called diverticula that form in the wall of the colon. It typically causes abdominal pain, fever, and changes in bowel habits (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the researchers in the new study noted that the reasons behind the rise in early-onset diverticulitis remain unclear, other studies have made the link to certain lifestyle factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A large‑scale lifestyle and genetics study by Mass General Brigham in 2025 found that individuals with a healthier lifestyle (non‑smoking, a BMI less than 25, higher physical activity, higher fiber intake, lower red meat consumption) had substantially lower risk of diverticulitis, even if they had a high genetic predisposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile several studies, particularly a large-scale twin 2012 study conducted in Sweden, have linked diverticulitis to genetics, with estimates suggesting that 40 to 53 percent of the risk is heritable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study further highlighted differences between younger and older patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset patients generally had lower mortality rates, shorter hospital stays - about a quarter of a day less on average - and lower hospital costs, roughly $1,900 less per admission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, younger patients were more likely to need invasive interventions, with 29 percent higher odds of a colectomy (a surgery to remove part or all of the colon) and 58 percent higher odds of needing the area to be drained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A colectomy is a surgical solution for severe, complicated, or recurrent diverticulitis, not a solution for all cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For milder cases, treatment typically involves antibiotics and lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the proportion of younger patients undergoing colectomy decreased from 34.7 percent to 20.3 percent, suggesting that more cases are being managed successfully earlier on without surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author and fourth-year medical student at UCLA Shineui Kim said of this finding: 'While younger patients generally have better survival outcomes and shorter hospitalizations, they're paradoxically more likely to need invasive interventions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This suggests their disease may be more aggressive or that treatment approaches differ based on patient age and overall health status.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Actor Josh Gad, 44, said using a GLP-1 drug for weight loss caused him to get diverticulitis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that further research is 'urgently needed' to explore exactly what is behind the boom in early-onset diverticulitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study appears in the journal Diseases in the Colon &amp;amp; Rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trend, the researchers said, mirrors similar increases in colorectal cancer among younger Americans, raising public health concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An investigation by the American Cancer Society (ACS) found that after a stable 15-year trend, diagnoses of local-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) rose dramatically in adults aged 45 to 49 years old between 2019 and 2022 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among this age group, cases were increasing one percent annually from 2004 to 2019, but that increase accelerated to 12 percent per year from 2019 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In people 20 to 39 years old, CRC incidence has increased steadily by 1.6 percent annually since 2004 and by two percent and 2.6 percent annually since 2012 among adults 40 to 44 and 50 to 54 years old, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, from 2021 to 2022, there was a 50 percent relative increase in diagnoses, rising from 11.7 per 100,000 people to 17.5 cases per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This steep increase was driven by the detection of early, local-stage tumors, which increased from 2019 to 2022 by 19 percent per year for colon cancer and by 25 percent per year for rectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Monica - who does not give her last name - found it difficult to get doctors to listen to her health concerns. The Australian, who is currently living in Croatia, was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last year when she was 31 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study's lead author Elizabeth Schafer attributed the rise in colon cancer diagnoses to new recommendations that lowered the screening age for the disease. A second ACS report found CRC screening among US adults 45 to 49 years of age increased by 62 percent from 2019 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recommended age to begin CRC screening was lowered from 50 to 45 by the ACS in 2018 and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) followed suit in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early onset colorectal cancer has become the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men under 50 and the second-leading cause for women under 50 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 50,000 Americans are expected to die from colorectal cancer this year, while 150,000 are predicted to be diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It involves waking up in the morning and jumping 50 times—that’s it. People swear it does everything from reduce bloat and fatigue to lower your blood pressure, and some say it even makes them feel more joyful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept seems to have started with Kathryn Smith, who is a trainer who helps with surgeries. “I’m a lazy person by nature,” she said in a July &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@kathhrynsmithh/video/7529493716998884622" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.tiktok.com/@kathhrynsmithh/video/7529493716998884622"}' href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kathhrynsmithh/video/7529493716998884622" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TikTok video&lt;/a&gt;, noting that it’s taken “baby steps” for her to be more active. One way she did it? By what she calls “morning jumping.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I get out of bed, my feet touch the ground, I jump 50 times,” she said. “What does your brain require first thing in the morning? Oxygen. How do you increase oxygen to your brain? Blood flow. How do you increase your blood flow? Increase your heart rate. Jump up and down.” She also noted that this can be good for lymphatic drainage and bone density. “If you have the ability to jump, you should do it every day,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, plenty of other people have shared videos of themselves jumping up and down, and they seem pretty happy about it.

But doctors and a fitness trainer say morning jumping is a fitness hack worth trying. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How jumping can impact your health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s suddenly popular, jumping up and down isn’t a new thing, per se. “This is essentially glorified jump roping,” &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/dr-eric-michael-ascher-do-1255718748" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/dr-eric-michael-ascher-do-1255718748"}' href="https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/dr-eric-michael-ascher-do-1255718748" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eric Ascher, DO&lt;/a&gt;, family medicine physician at Northwell’s Lenox Hill Hospital, tells SELF. “But we know that jumping and jumping rope are wonderful means of managing blood pressure, fatigue, and bloating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jumping can raise your heart rate, along with elevate your body temperature and increase blood flow and fluid movement in the body, &lt;a href="https://kines.rutgers.edu/faculty/faculty/faculty-profile/317-full-time-faculty/1122-malin-steven-k" target="_blank"&gt;Steven K. Malin, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the Department of Kinesiology and Health at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, tells SELF. “The higher body temperature helps along with increased blood and fluid movement to loosen joints, tendons, and muscles for flexibility,” he says. Moving your body can also help with getting your lymphatic system moving, which can help remove waste from your body, Dr. Ascher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SELF Magazine</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 21:50:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTFBtaFpEbEI4UWIzNThDS0o2cmU0R20tWFVTWFJhQTlNMENIWFloWWpBV1lfNE0wMkVSMnpwd19hWWxJU2Z0VlZfSnhrVTdrajZ0bmFILVF2NXUtYzZDQU92Z2hzY2M1QQ</guid></item><item><title>这种“永恒”的饮食模式可以帮助降低血压，即使是高风险人群-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/this-timeless-eating-pattern-can-help-lower-blood-pressure-even-in-high-risk-individuals/photostory/125063250.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet isn’t a strict meal plan but rather a style of eating inspired by the traditional cuisines of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, such as Greece, Italy, and Spain.

The study suggested that eating more minimally processed plant-based proteins may lower the risk for high blood pressure. One of the senior authors of the study Dr. Marcia Otto said, “Our study focused on foods, not the plant-based supplements that can be found on store shelves”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another important finding was that minimally processed animal proteins could be included in weekly meal plans without significantly affecting a person's high blood pressure risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>每年有170万美国老年人死于这种疾病。如何在十大死因中幸存下来？ - Money Talks新闻</title><link>https://www.moneytalksnews.com/million-older-americans-die-like-this-every-year-what-can-you-do-to-survive-the-top-causes-of-death/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Money Talks News</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 21:20:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxOX21pcmczS1RIaV9xZFFYOHpBS003YU9fZjJDODlkTUZvbUJoSjZHQk1RYnk0YUtCMHFSbWxyeWFxT1ZZczN4TXNYOXA1elpnQkttUkw2M2tkb0pvYUJ6SlRBU1d0U1cwZ3pOMUdFLThGWWpHVEdwVVpjcEc2VDBOZ29JSXZXcTBVLUF1STFZSWpkbTNpQzVtVk9Mc3hOMVpCaVYxaUxoNy1Bc09UbE5idllrdE9iWjJLeGxjcmlqYnRVUEppTDdWUmtPUQ</guid></item><item><title>1人在Marcy暴露于Rabid Raccoon - WKTV</title><link>https://www.wktv.com/news/local/1-person-in-marcy-exposed-to-rabid-raccoon/article_e9375f9e-9e6f-4187-9015-74049f73b13c.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I'm a lab scientist. Had a guy come in at the end of the day for chest pain that’s been bothering him 'all weekend.' The emergency doc ordered a troponin blood test, which helps rule in/out heart attacks. If the test runs above 0.03, we consider that a sign for a heart attack and act accordingly. This guy’s very first troponin was 21.00. TWENTY-ONE. The highest we’ve ever had up till then was an 8.00. The guy should’ve been dead ages ago, but he somehow pulled through.

        &lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2, the cause of covid-19, isn’t the only coronavirus in the world we should be keeping our eye on. Scientists appear to have just discovered a new branch of coronaviruses in Brazilian bats that could have the tools needed to spill over and infect humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A large team of researchers in Japan and Brazil identified the possible zoonotic threat in a preliminary study released last week. The viral relative appears to be genetically distinct from other coronaviruses yet shares a feature with SARS-CoV-2 that may allow its kind to infect human cells. The findings suggest there are plenty of native bat coronaviruses in the wild with the potential to cause new epidemics in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The high diversity of viruses in bats therefore positions them as a key taxonomic group for zoonotic disease surveillance,” the authors &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.24.684489v1"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in their paper, presented as a preprint on the website bioRxiv.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A key similarity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even prior to the emergence of covid-19 more than five years ago, scientists had been worried about &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/were-not-ready-for-the-next-pandemic-1839169413"&gt;coronaviruses&lt;/a&gt; causing the next big pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, its earlier ancestor SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are coronaviruses that successfully became human pathogens over the past two decades; all three belong to the betacoronavirus genus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the study researchers, however, almost everything we know about the diversity of this genus is based on data collected from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, with little genetic sequencing of such viruses in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To help remedy this gap in knowledge, the team analyzed gut tissue samples collected from 70 bats in three sites across Brazil between May and August 2019. They found the new virus in a Parnell’s mustached bat (&lt;em&gt;Pteronotus parnellii&lt;/em&gt;) and completely sequenced its genome.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Based on their analysis, the virus—which they coined BRZ batCoV—is different enough genetically to represent a previously unknown subgenus of betacoronavirus. Until now, five subgenera had been identified.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the virus also appears to have something important in common with SARS-CoV-2: a functional furin cleavage site (FCS) at the S1/S2 junction of its spike protein. In fact, the FCS in BRZ batCoV is only different by a single amino acid compared to the one in SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;How worried should we be?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FCS in SARS-CoV-2 is one of the features that helps it to infect humans. So finding something very similar in this new virus is certainly troubling. The researchers also note that other bat betacoronaviruses are known to have an FCS in the same location, suggesting it’s relatively easy for this feature to pop up in these viruses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another concerning aspect is that since there’s so little surveillance of Brazil and other areas in the Americas, it’s more than possible that BRZ batCoV and similar viruses have been circulating under our noses for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The new research hasn’t been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet, a vital part of vetting any new study. The researchers also point out that they haven’t directly examined the infectivity of BRZ batCoV, a caveat that limits how much we can know about its risk to humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hence, although the presence of an FCS is clearly significant, any discussion of the zoonotic potential of this virus should be limited,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, this sort of research should be seen as an early warning signal. While the origins of SARS-CoV-2 are still being debated—even if &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/virologists-and-epidemiologists-back-natural-origin-covid-19-survey-suggests"&gt;most virologists&lt;/a&gt; are in the natural camp—many human diseases do first start off as zoonotic germs that successfully jump from animals to people (case in point, the&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1472041/#:~:text=Additional%20SARS%20cases%20resulted%20from,virus%20to%20humans%20(60)."&gt; original SARS&lt;/a&gt;). Bats and the viruses they carry are a prime suspect for causing the next big pandemic, and it’s urgent that we better track what’s out there, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Our study provides a broader understanding of the phylogenetic and functional diversity of bat coronaviruses as well as their zoonotic potential,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reducing the risk of a life-altering neurodegenerative disease by almost half sounds like it should require some sort of miraculous medicinal intervention, but an increasing number of scientific studies suggest it could be as simple as listening to music. In October 2025, the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gps.70163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published a study that found an incredibly strong association between mental health in old age and one’s connection to music. The study observed participants who both listened to music and played an instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
            
        
            &lt;p id="sv-video-container"&gt;
              
            &lt;/p&gt;
        
                
            



&lt;p&gt;Scientists discovered a 39% reduction in &lt;a href="https://americansongwriter.com/the-surprising-scientific-link-between-dementia-and-hit-songs-by-elvis-presley-abba-and-spice-girls/"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; in individuals who reported they “always” listened to music as opposed to “never,” “rarely,” or “sometimes.” Those who documented themselves as “often” or “always” playing a musical instrument saw a 35% reduction in dementia risk. Individuals who did both showed a 33% reduction. Listening to and playing music also helped reduce the risk of non-dementia cognitive decline. Interestingly, the study found stronger correlations between decreased dementia risk and music in individuals with over 16 years of education, as opposed to those with 15 years or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a study published three months earlier, a different group of researchers found that the brains of older individuals who regularly played an instrument responded to stimuli in a manner that more closely resembled that of younger brains. Their non-musical counterparts, on the other hand, showed greater cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Just like a well-tuned instrument doesn’t need to be played louder to be heard, the brains of older musicians stay finely tuned thanks to years of training,” the study’s co-author, Dr. Yi Du, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/brain-musical-instrument" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;told BBC Science Focus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-music-with-this-added-might-reduce-dementia-risk-even-more"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music With This Added Might Reduce Dementia Risk Even More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Listening to music of any kind can help reduce the risk of dementia in older individuals. But multiple studies suggest that listening to a specific frequency in tandem with one’s favorite music could be even more effective in minimizing the potential for cognitive decline. Researchers have long touted the benefits of 40 Hz stimulation with both light and sound can reduce Alzheimer’s disease pathology and symptoms in both mice and humans. In 2024, scientists at the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197457224000223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johns Hopkins School of Nursing&lt;/a&gt; found that combining participants’ favorite music with a 40 Hz stimulus further reduces the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Johns Hopkins researchers asked the study participants to listen to their “40 Hz music” for a minimum of one hour per day, preferably three hours before bed. By combining individuals’ favorite music with 40 Hz therapy, participants were more receptive to the treatment, which appears to minimize or reduce dementia-like symptoms. According to the study, this can “improve usability and practical enjoyment” of this specific type of therapy. (Because if a therapy is so unpleasant that no one wants to use it, then what’s the point?)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are lots of things we can do to maintain our health as we age, and not all of them are always pleasant. And while we’re by no means undermining the importance of eating specific foods, avoiding others, abstaining from alcohol or other drugs, and regularly exercising, listening to music seems to have just as many benefits for our mental health and is arguably way more enjoyable than some of those aforementioned risk-reduction activities. Happy listening!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spending too much time being sedentary is the number one habit to break to burn visceral fat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smart exercise strategies such as starting small, setting a timer and variety can help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nutrition, sleep and stress management are all helpful in reducing visceral fat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Plank Challenge may be all over social media. But there’s another reason to burn off belly fat that has nothing to do with sculpting killer abs. Belly fat, technically known as visceral fat, can spell bad news for your health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve never heard of visceral fat before, this type of fat burrows deep into your abdomen, where it surrounds organs like the liver and intestines. That doesn’t just make your belly rounder. Visceral fat also cranks out inflammatory proteins that increase the risk of chronic illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and some cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, your lifestyle habits can have a big impact on the amount of visceral fat you carry. If you’d like to trim belly fat and improve your health in the process, read on to learn the No. 1 habit to break to reduce visceral fat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re sitting down reading this, then stand up immediately. Then get ready for this … being too sedentary is the No. 1 habit you need to break ASAP to reduce visceral fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why? Most of us are not nearly active enough (and spend way too much time sitting!).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While physical activity guidelines recommend engaging in at least 150 minutes of activity per week, less than half of us actually meet these recommendations.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yet, research reveals that increasing physical activity may be one of the best ways to stop the progression of diseases triggered by excess body fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “By increasing movement, you can build lean body mass, which helps to increase overall resting metabolism, promoting more favorable body composition,” says &lt;a href="https://erinpalinski.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. “Movement also enhances fat metabolism and regulates insulin levels, helping the body burn stored fat more effectively.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Burning visceral fat may require some strategies. Here are some expert tips on how to do it:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Small: &lt;/strong&gt;Visceral fat may be stubborn, but you don’t have to run a marathon to get rid of it. “If you're new to regular movement, start with just 10 to 15 minutes of an activity you enjoy, like a walk around your neighborhood, dancing or yoga,” says &lt;a href="https://www.patriciabannan.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Bannan, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Fit in movement throughout the day in small ways, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator, parking farther away, or taking the long way to the coffee machine at work to add more steps to your day,” adds Palinski-Wade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buddy Up:&lt;/strong&gt; The best way to make it a habit is to repeat it daily until it’s as normal as brushing your teeth. Bannan recommends teaming up with a friend to make your movement habit stick. “Celebrating small wins, like reaching a daily step goal, can build momentum and make it easier to stay active in the long term,” she says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a Timer: &lt;/strong&gt;“Every 30 to 60 minutes, set a reminder to stand up, stretch or walk around for a couple of minutes,” says Bannan. “This breaks up long periods of sitting and helps stimulate circulation and muscle activity.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pace Around the House:&lt;/strong&gt; Palinski-Wade recommends walking while talking on the phone instead of sitting. “This way you are using time you already have to fit more movement into your busy day,” she adds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pump Some Iron: &lt;/strong&gt;“Strength training is one of the best things you can do to offset visceral fat,” says Palinski-Wade. “Aim to add strength training one to two times per week, focusing on major muscle groups to improve strength and lean body mass.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix Up Your Workouts: &lt;/strong&gt;Strength training isn’t the only way to burn visceral fat. Research has found that three aerobic or interval workouts per week are also effective for reducing belly fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips-for-reducing-visceral-fat"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Other Tips for Reducing Visceral Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yes, moving is key, but there are even more steps you can take to lose visceral fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Log Those Zzz’s. &lt;/strong&gt;“Just one poor night of sleep can increase appetite and insulin resistance, making you more likely to eat excess calories and triggering your body to store more visceral fat versus burning it,” says Palinski-Wade. In addition to practicing good sleep hygiene, these&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291992/6-sleep-habits-that-can-help-you-lose-weight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; healthy sleep habits&lt;/a&gt; can also help with weight management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chill Out.&lt;/strong&gt; “Mindfulness activities, such as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290947/mindful-eating-the-key-to-eating-what-you-want-and-fully-enjoying-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;mindful eating &lt;/a&gt;or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-relieve-stress-in-10-minutes-8739935" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;stress-reducing practices&lt;/a&gt;, like meditation or deep breathing, can help lower cortisol levels, a hormone linked to visceral fat accumulation,” says Bannan. “Managing stress through mindfulness can be an effective way to support your body’s ability to burn fat, particularly in the abdominal area.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enlist Fiber. &lt;/strong&gt;“Adding more fiber to your diet can help to balance blood sugar, which in turn can lessen insulin resistance that stores visceral fat,” says Palinski-Wade. “In addition, dietary fiber helps to curb appetite and may promote weight loss, further lowering visceral fat levels.” Plus, high-fiber foods are often rich in antioxidants, which may offset inflammation and reduce stress hormones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Skimp on Fat.&lt;/strong&gt; It may sound counterintuitive, but in order to lose visceral fat, you have to eat healthy fats. “&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fish-to-eat-for-weight-loss-8670654" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/a&gt; is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce inflammation and improve fat metabolism,” says Bannan. “Including salmon or other fatty fish, like mackerel, sardines, herring or trout in your diet a couple of times a week can support your efforts to reduce visceral fat while also promoting heart and brain health.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no magic pill to reduce visceral body fat. However, nutrition experts agree that simply moving more can improve your body composition and reduce visceral body fat. And you don’t have to log hours in the gym to see results. While strength training and aerobic activity are excellent ways to burn belly fat, going for regular walks with a friend or scheduling movement breaks into your workday are great ways to incorporate more activity into your day. The goal is to rack up those 150 minutes of physical activity each week. And if you still want to do the Plank Challenge, well, that’s great too!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sun Pharmaceutical Industries of New Jersey recalled certain bottles of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules, a generic version of Vyvanse that was sold nationwide.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Class II classification indicates that the recalled medication “may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences,” but the risk of serious health consequences is low.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sun Pharmaceutical Industries recalled the medication due to “failed dissolution specifications,” meaning the drug did not dissolve as expected in laboratory settings, which could make it less effective.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The manufacturer did not issue a press release about this recall, so there are no specific instructions for medication users.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, it's not recommended to stop ADHD medication abruptly, as it could cause withdrawal symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Check your medications at home, and if you have any bottles affected by the recall, don’t take them.

&lt;p class="custom-html embed-container mv-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle isn’t the only city that’s faced difficult neighborhood conversations when deciding where to locate services aimed at helping people in mental health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan King County Council &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/mental-health/king-county-council-approves-plans-funding-for-capitol-hill-crisis-center/" class="content-link"&gt;voted last month to place a walk-in mental health crisis center on Capitol Hill&lt;/a&gt; — a location that sparked discussions in the surrounding neighborhood and heated public comments at council meetings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of the center say the facility is needed in the neighborhood, which struggles with disorder tied to homelessness, drug use and mental health. But some local residents, business owners and real estate owners voiced concern about how the center might affect public safety in the surrounding area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://dchsblog.com/2025/10/01/listening-to-local-voices-community-engagement-for-the-seattle-crisis-care-center-location/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;King County says it has held nearly 60&lt;/a&gt; community conversations, presentations, walking tours and other events focused on the Capitol Hill location, some in the neighborhood say the county hasn’t sufficiently engaged with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other U.S. cities have also navigated community relationships and dealt with pushback as they seek to build centers adjacent to residential areas and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can Seattle learn from other cities’ experience? Similar centers in Denver and Milwaukee can provide lessons on managing relationships and operating a center successfully. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-19008117-1353473057" class="st-image-gallery standard-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"standard-embed","images":[{"id":19008117,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=300x226 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=1024x772 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=768x579 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=1536x1158 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=2048x1544 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=780x588 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=1020x769 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=1560x1176 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=2040x1538 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=375x283 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=780x588","caption":"King County plans to site a new mental health crisis center on Capitol Hill, at a former Polyclinic building located at 1145 Broadway.

Almost half of residents are below the poverty line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Valley has a lot of publicly subsidized affordable housing, and a lot of families, said Jeanne Granville, president of the Sun Valley Community Coalition. Census data shows that more than half the population is under the age of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city’s vision for the center had a lot in common with &lt;a href="https://www.desc.org/what-we-do/crisis-response/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;DESC’s Crisis Solutions Center&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle — it would accept people via referrals from law enforcement and other first responders. People could access services including behavioral health assessment, counseling and inpatient treatment during short-term stays in the crisis stabilization unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city contracted with WellPower, a large mental health provider in Colorado, to operate the center. WellPower also partners with the Denver Police Department to send mental health professionals to calls alongside police. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were not necessarily the program that the neighborhood wanted,” said Ellen Todd, WellPower’s associate director for crisis services. “They wanted a youth program coming in, and this was not it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-19008046-2031076544" class="st-image-gallery standard-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"standard-embed","images":[{"id":19008046,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=300x200 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=1024x683 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=768x512 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=1536x1024 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=2048x1365 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=780x520 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=1020x680 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=1560x1040 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=2040x1360 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=375x250 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=780x520","caption":"Inside the Behavioral Health Solutions Center in Denver, patients can access services including behavioral health assessment, counseling and inpatient treatment during short-term stays in the crisis stabilization unit.

They didn’t really understand how the center would be structured or what it would do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a better understanding of who it was going to be, how it was going to serve folks, how it was going to operate was really important,” Granville said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the center opened, the community coalition and the provider worked with a mediator from the city to draft a &lt;a href="https://www.denvergov.org/files/assets/public/v/1/public-health-and-environment/documents/cbh/solutioncenter_goodneighboragreement.pdf" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Good Neighbor Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It outlined requirements WellPower (formerly named the Mental Health Center of Denver) and the city of Denver must follow, including 24/7 security staffing, the creation of a neighborhood advisory committee, and regular reporting on the center’s use. It also banned the center from admitting registered sex offenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King County will require every center’s operator to create a good neighbor agreement with the surrounding community. For Capitol Hill, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell &lt;a href="https://harrell.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2025/08/COS-CCC-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;has also asked the county&lt;/a&gt; to partner with Seattle police on a security assessment and plan for ongoing safe operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The good neighbor agreements are really a useful tool to sit down and walk through those concerns and be proactive,” Granville said. “If there are things that come up, how will they be addressed quickly?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wellpower.org/behavioral-health-solutions-center/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;The Behavioral Health Solutions Center opened in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and has had “very little effect” on the neighborhood, Granville said. Initially, WellPower held monthly meetings the neighborhood could attend; now they’re just quarterly “because things have been going so well,” Todd said. &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;There’s a key difference from the center planned in Capitol Hill: Patients can’t walk in on their own. WellPower operates a walk-in crisis center in another part of the city, which served about 2,300 people in 2024.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granville thinks a walk-in center would have been a “very different situation” that the Sun Valley community wouldn’t have been receptive to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the solutions center served 777 people. WellPower creates a discharge plan for every patient and offers Lyft rides or bus tickets to the next location they’re going to, Todd said. If they need shelter, they can stay in adjacent temporary housing for up to 30 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patient transportation and discharge planning have also been questions in King County. The county has said money is designated for postdischarge stabilization, which will include staff to take patients to follow-up appointments and transportation to get them to their home, a shelter or another treatment facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granville said the Sun Valley neighborhood’s safety concerns haven’t come to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We already know that there are people who are experiencing behavioral health and substance use crises in your neighborhood,” Todd said. “We are here to help them and to provide those services. Without us, people are walking around and they’re still experiencing a behavioral health or substance use crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingPostscript" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Credible messengers&lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A unique requirement of Wisconsin’s involuntary treatment system led to a new emergency mental health center in Milwaukee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin has a law that applies to large counties: People brought in on an involuntary mental health hold (which in Wisconsin, can only be initiated by police) must be assessed by a physician within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means a mental health-specific emergency center plays a key role in streamlining the system, said Michael Lappen, Milwaukee County’s behavioral health administrator. It allows law enforcement to bring patients to a facility that’s specifically designed to evaluate and treat them, without putting that burden on generalized hospital emergency rooms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milwaukee County had for decades run a crisis emergency department as part of a larger mental health complex in Wauwatosa, a suburb west of the city. In 2018, it decided to outsource inpatient psychiatric care to Universal Health Services — but the private company declined to take responsibility for the emergency department, &lt;a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/solutions/2019/08/16/milwaukee-county-could-lose-its-psychiatric-crisis-center/1819222001/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the old mental health complex moved toward closure, the county had to figure out how to open a designated emergency center — “the thing that makes the system work here,” Lappen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A parcel was available next to the county’s human services building in the King Park neighborhood. The neighborhood is mostly residential and has some low income housing; it’s close to downtown, but separated by Interstate 43. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The available property was also in the center of the need for mental health care. Data showed that 70% of people admitted to the county’s mental health crisis center were from the 53205 ZIP code (where the property is located) or one of nine adjacent ZIP codes, Lappen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Lanier, a pastor in Milwaukee, was part of the county’s Mental Health Board and had previously launched a &lt;a href="https://wjlanier.com/miracle-mental-health-2/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;mental health ministry&lt;/a&gt; working to decrease stigma in the city’s Black community. He helped the county spread the word about the center with the community through listening sessions and outreach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It increased their credibility and relationship with the community because we were credible messengers,” Lanier said. “That strong relationship with our network bore a lot of relational fruit. It’s extra significant in a city like Milwaukee that’s known for being highly segregated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Lappen and Lanier said there wasn’t much pushback from the neighborhood community where the center was planned. Lanier appreciated the county’s intentionality in engaging during the planning process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes that community engagement is thought of as an afterthought or an appendage to a process that’s already foregone,” Lanier said. “Because of our relationships and advocacy, that allowed for a richer process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://mentalhealthmke.org/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Mental Health Emergency Center&lt;/a&gt; opened in September 2022 and has averaged about 8,000 visits per year. Adults and youth can access medication and short-term care to help them stabilize; the average adult stay is seven hours, Lappen said. If patients need more intensive treatment, the center will help transfer them to inpatient care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of patients come in voluntarily and half are brought in on involuntary treatment holds. The county pays half of the operating costs and the rest is split among local hospital systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being adjacent to downtown is helpful, Lappen said, because people are able to access other services to get meals or shelters. There’s a large hospital two blocks away, where patients can be transferred if they need more intensive medical care. It’s also much faster for law enforcement and other first responders to bring patients in for evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We went from being where nobody was to where 70% of the patients actually live,” Lappen said. “That’s why it’s working out so well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They haven’t seen increased crime or negative outcomes around the center, Lappen said. The effects have actually been positive: Fewer people living outside in the neighborhood, fewer people in crisis, less crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anything, Lanier said, the community has said the facility should be bigger so it could serve more people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For us, this is the bridge to get to service, and it makes the community better and healthier,” Lappen said. “If your community embraces that getting help actually shouldn’t be stigmatized, it should be celebrated, then you’ll see a culture where that’s accepted.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It was, as my sports medicine doctor counseled, “time”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Since I was a teen, it had been my primary form of exercise and stress relief. But for months, I had been ignoring small signs of encroaching decrepitude: the popping and grinding in my right knee and hip joints whenever I stood up, bent down or took the stairs. The medical term for this is crepitus, yet I kept stubbornly persuading myself that I was still a “young” fiftysomething.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I had imbibed the common positive ageing message: “50 is the new 30.” Yet as far as the cells that make up my knee and hip tendons and cartilage are concerned, 50 is still very much 50. So much for the popular idea that our overall “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/well/live/biological-age-testing.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt;” can be far younger than our chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For decades, I had done everything experts recommend – eat well, sleep well, exercise – and yet my doctor was still telling me it was time to adapt to my changing body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;My physiatrist told me that many of his gen X patients, now in their late 40s and 50s, have bought into the idea that age shouldn’t be a factor when it comes to what exercise they do or how they do it. Each trendy sport or exercise sends a new wave of us into his office and others like it. For instance, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31796221/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a 2020 study&lt;/a&gt; found that nearly 91% of people showing up to the emergency room with injuries related to playing pickleball were over 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many people approach their physical fitness as if they were a decade or two younger. My GP told me that patients over 50 are often frustrated by any suggestion that their routines might have to change. I started to see this denial of physical realities everywhere. One of my colleagues injured her shoulder doing CrossFit, then re-injured herself a few months later doing the same routine. A friend who has practiced yoga for decades fractured her chin in a fall from crow pose. When I suggested she modify her routine, she scoffed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2df18a7b-fa8b-4fdd-b834-51d3c9492827" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"How do I stay healthy in my 50s, 60s and 70s?","elementId":"2df18a7b-fa8b-4fdd-b834-51d3c9492827","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/jul/23/how-stay-healthy-50s-60s-70s-ageing-tips-advice"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As a medical anthropologist, I wondered: had anti-ageing messaging accidentally created a new problem? Was our generation at risk not from under-exercising, like the boomer and silent generations before us, but from over-exercising?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-our-bodies-change-as-we-age" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How our bodies change as we age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Emily Finkelstein, a geriatrician at Weill Cornell Medicine, loves that people in their 40s, 50s and 60s have internalized that exercise is important for healthy ageing and longevity. That being said, there are some practical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Our muscle mass and our performance peak in our mid-30s,” Finkelstein said, “and start to naturally decline after that. We do need to be flexible in terms of what we’re doing and expecting of ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As we edge past 45, we begin to lose critical muscle mass, which can decrease our strength and balance. Decreases in bone density can leave us more vulnerable to stress fractures from repetitive motions and stress. The cartilage in our joints thin, while tendons and ligaments stiffen. All of this means we’re more prone to injuries during physical activity. Recovery takes longer too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The thing that people don’t know and don’t learn,” Dr Rosanne Leipzig said, “is that ageing begins at birth, and your abilities are definitely going to change.” Leipzig knows quite a lot about this process, both as a professor of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and as someone in her 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You reach a maximum for your muscle mass, bone strength, ability to remember a list of words, all in your 30s. And everything starts to decline after that,” she said. “Ageing doesn’t mean that you can’t do what you did previously, but you probably can’t do as much in the same time period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;One of the best things we can do for our own healthy ageing is to be flexible and adaptable&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most experts agreed that messages like “50 is the new 30” can be helpful if they convince people not to write themselves off as they age. It’s OK to push ourselves a bit physically. But the flip side is an assumption that a 50-year-old body isn’t different from a 30-year-old body. It is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“One of the best things we can do for our own healthy ageing is to be flexible and adaptable,” Finkelstein said. “We need to change our expectations and we need to change how we exercise as we get older.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-adapt-to-ageing-bodies-and-avoid-injury" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to adapt to ag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ing bodies and avoid injury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In midlife, we should all learn to be more in tune with our bodies. That might mean taking more recovery time between intense workouts, doing more stretching and integrating more weights into our fitness routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A healthy adaptive approach to exercising as we age might involve regular self-monitoring and assessment of how our bodies feel both during and after workouts, and seeking input from a qualified medical professional when we start to notice any signs or symptoms of an encroaching problem, such as pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Leipzig suggests that physicians begin conversations about adjustments by asking patients what it is they love about an activity they’re holding on to. A tennis player might really love the social aspect. In that case, they could switch to pickleball – which is less taxing, but similar – with a complementary strength-training and stretching regimen to prevent injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But since risk of injury naturally rises as we age, it’s also important to have a backup plan for if and when we overdo it. When I talked to Dr Melissa Leber, associate professor of orthopedics and emergency medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine, she had just finished working at the US Open. Leber has a lot of experience dealing with athletes – both professional and amateur – who have pushed themselves a bit too hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Some people are really good at adjusting and they’re comfortable with their bodies changing,” Leber said. “Others go hardcore. I’ve seen some patients who don’t even want a day off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-23" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So, if you’re a runner with an injury, try a modified strength-training routine and a lower-impact activity, like swimming. Then, when you start running again, run fewer times a week or for shorter distances. To avoid injury or overuse, experts recommend one or two rest days a week, at minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Strength training is also very important. “The stronger you are,” Leber said, “the more you will avoid injury and falls. And when you do fall, you will fall differently. Your balance will be better, and you’ll recover from injury faster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As a rule, Leber advises that someone in their 50s should spend 50% of their total exercise time on strength training and 50% doing cardio. By age 60, that metric should be 60% strength and 40% cardio.

That being said, Finkelstein pointed out that most general physicians aren’t all that well-trained in exercise physiology. For specific recommendations pertaining to exercise regimens, it’s better to see a physiatrist, specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation or certified physical trainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I wish we were all better trained in that,” Finkelstein said, “because it’s so important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ ","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"3b504e44-3a8d-480c-b083-5ebef6a11c4c","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="3b504e44-3a8d-480c-b083-5ebef6a11c4c" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To compound this, conversations about how to maintain muscle mass, bone health, aerobic capacity and cardiovascular fitness take more time than the average physician can spend with their patients. Many people fill that gap with advice from fitness influencers online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="cultivating-realistic-expectations-of-ageing" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivating realistic expectations of ag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Finkelstein worries about the effect of the media – especially social media, with its legions of wellness and anti-ageing influencers. “Take these supplements, do this exercise program, join this fitness routine: you name it, people are serving it up,” she said. “I worry a lot about that in terms of the reliability of those people and the science behind what they’re offering, and people being vulnerable to that because you want to do what you can to stay healthy and youthful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Popular media also loves to feature “superagers” – people whose mental and/or physical abilities are comparable to people 20-30 years younger. And while it’s good to see, say, an 87-year-old running a marathon, it may lead to false expectations about normal ageing. Superagers are rare; only about 10% of the general population fit all the criteria for inclusion in the category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;In our society, we have a huge problem with accepting … that things are going to change&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In other words, it’s not very realistic for those of us in our middle age or older to think we’ll rack up those personal bests forever. As the experts kept pointing out, the best approach to exercising as we age is realistic and adaptive. A runner who adapts to the changes of their ageing body and trains effectively may still be able to run the Boston marathon, but the time it takes for them to cross the finish line will necessarily lengthen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Part of the problem might be optimism bias. While we may logically understand that bodies change, we don’t think we are actually changing. Maybe that’s because we’re living in a culture that is obsessed not only with longevity, but with looking younger. The number of cosmetic procedures has &lt;a href="https://americanmedspa.org/news/isaps-releases-2024-global-survey-results-ranks-surgical-and-nonsurgical-procedure-popularity" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increased 42.5% globally&lt;/a&gt; over the last four years, and Americans spent an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/cosmetic-surgery-market" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$20bn on cosmetic surgery&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In our society, we have a huge problem with accepting the fact that things are going to change,” Leipzig said. “People are in better shape in general than they ever have been, if they’re privileged enough to be able to take care of their needs, but it leads them to think they will never die. It leads to ageism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And that’s the rub: being overly concerned with how much “younger” you are for your age is just another form of bias – one that you can hold against your future self. “Fifty is the new 30” simply underscores our misconception that being healthy means not ageing at all. It would be healthier if we occasionally reminded ourselves that ageing is a privilege; that “50 is 50” and “80 is 80” – and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 17:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOQWVTNzBBM215N2tUUUxmN2FKcDRKbXdDSzBibHZDU25QUnlacmRIMFlyN2hsMXVYMWM0SlphX09qNjhuS1BFSTQyRjc0ZGRMbGdEZFFJdlJYT0NJbnZyUlprQUZRZWFrSmw3Q3JmY2xhYlFxbEc0cVpoX2MyYmMzNEx5ZVB0cEhjUjZLTEpDRQ</guid></item><item><title>VEXAS综合征炎症和髓样偏倚的独立机制-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09815-0</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Abs1-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somatically acquired mutations in the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme &lt;i&gt;UBA1&lt;/i&gt; within hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were recently identified as the cause of the adult-onset autoinflammatory syndrome VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X linked, autoinflammatory, somatic)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;i&gt;UBA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations in VEXAS lead to clonal expansion within the HSPC and myeloid, but not lymphoid, compartments. Despite its severity and prevalence, the mechanisms whereby &lt;i&gt;UBA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations cause multiorgan autoinflammation and hematologic disease are unknown. Here, we employ somatic gene editing approaches to model VEXAS-associated &lt;i&gt;UBA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations in primary macrophages and HSPCs. &lt;i&gt;Uba1&lt;/i&gt;-mutant macrophages exposed to inflammatory stimuli underwent aberrant apoptotic and necroptotic cell death mediated by Caspase-8 and RIPK3-MLKL, respectively. Accordingly, in mice challenged with TNF or LPS, the UBA1 inhibitor TAK-243 exacerbated inflammation in a RIPK3-Caspase-8-dependent manner. In contrast, &lt;i&gt;Uba1&lt;/i&gt; mutation in HSPCs induced an unfolded protein response and myeloid bias independently of RIPK3-Caspase-8. Mechanistically, aberrant cell death of &lt;i&gt;Uba1&lt;/i&gt;-mutant macrophages coincided with a kinetic defect in Lys63/Met1 (i.e., linear) polyubiquitylation of inflammatory signaling complexes. Collectively, our results link VEXAS pathogenesis with that of rarer monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes; highlight specific ubiquitin-associated defects stemming from an apical mutation in the ubiquitylation cascade; and support therapeutic targeting of the inflammatory cell death axis in VEXAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 16:45:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1qZ2Nicm5PR0NBSTNCZ185eEotYkZpZDdqeUo0MzJ4UU84Y1pNTHJGdUxtY0t6UmphSVloUTl6dzVvVjBvMTZ5VlNkQWc3SUpQOUhjdHNDemtNWUx4N0Nj</guid></item><item><title>新的研究将褪黑激素与心力衰竭联系起来，但专家表示不要惊慌失措-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/03/melatonin-heart-failure-sleep-aid/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6ILAJW3UZBCKRJD6OQXSXDLR7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A study that reviewed health records for tens of thousands of adults with chronic insomnia found that people who took prescribed melatonin for more than a year had a higher chance of heart failure over five years compared with people who were identified as nonusers, the American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/long-term-use-of-melatonin-supplements-to-support-sleep-may-have-negative-health-effects?preview=6f74&amp;amp;preview_mode=True" target="_blank"&gt;announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;.

It is considered extremely rare, with its true incidence unknown because it is often misdiagnosed or overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This doesn't just trick a breathalyzer. Fermenting yeast, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11354181/Fatal-fungi-releases-list-dangerous-fungal-pathogens-growing-threat.html"&gt;typically Candida albicans&lt;/a&gt;, creates real alcohol in the bloodstream, leading to the same stumbling, slurring and mental impairment as if Jane had been drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dean Mitchell, a prominent &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-ad7bf510-b42f-11f0-8154-a97bfc676553"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; immunologist who works with ABS patients, told the Daily Mail: 'It's quite powerful to have somebody that literally didn't take a drink of alcohol and is failing a breathalyzer test.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell pointed to a clear pattern in his auto-brewery syndrome patients. Every single one had recently taken antibiotics, which are known to disrupt the gut's natural balance of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;After taking antibiotics and acid reflux medicine, teacher and mother Jane began fermenting carbs into alcohol in her gut. This condition caused her to fail breathalyzer tests twice while completely sober (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antibiotics wipe out both harmful and beneficial gut bacteria, creating a void that allows Candida yeast to proliferate unchecked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One day, after grabbing a cupcake to eat on her way home, a quick burst of sugar to carry her through dinner time, Jane soon felt bloated in her stomach and her concentration had become cloudy. Before she knew it, she had run a red light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A police officer pulled her over, suspecting she was drunk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her denial, a breathalyzer test confirmed his suspicion, leading to a citation and a court summons for a DUI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a second, equally baffling incident in which a police officer pulled her over, she was desperate for a medical explanation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It would be weeks before Jane’s doctor could issue and explain the diagnosis, auto-brewery syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A specific yeast in her gut, Candida, was fermenting the carbohydrates in her food, effectively brewing alcohol inside her own body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it all may have stemmed from antibiotic use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Once she was diagnosed with ABS, Jane finally had an explanation for her crippling fatigue, her brain fog and slurred speech, especially after eating carb-heavy foods (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Dr Dean Mitchell, a prominent New York City immunologist, told the Daily Mail that nearly all of his patients with Candida overgrowth have a history of long-term antibiotic use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell told the Daily Mail that widespread over-prescription of antibiotics ‘is a little bit heartbreaking.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: ‘I see a lot of young people who've been on tetracycline for six months for acne, or I see people for chronic Lyme disease, the chronic sinus and bronchitis patients and the urinary tract patients. I'm not a believer that long-term antibiotics help those patients.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients journey to his New York City clinic reporting the same core symptoms: stubborn fatigue, brain fog, and bloating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For some, this progresses to full-scale intoxication, including dizziness, slurred speech, and blood alcohol levels sufficient to fail a breathalyzer test despite complete sobriety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He first rules out conditions like anemia. If standard tests are normal and the patient has a history of triggers like antibiotics or acid blockers, he uses a 15-questionnaire to help confirm a diagnosis of Candida overgrowth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He categorizes the condition into four stages. It typically begins with digestive issues like bloating after high-carb meals, then progresses to localized problems such as chronic sinusitis, vaginitis and unexplained rashes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell said: ‘Patients that I would see with chronic sinusitis and sometimes the other symptoms, like the GI symptoms, they're like, oh my god, I’ve seen an [ear, nose and throat doctor] for two years. He keeps on giving me antibiotics, he gives me steroids and I've had two operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And then all of a sudden, I treat them for the Candida overgrowth and their sinuses get better and their fatigue gets better.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Candida albicans, the yeast that causes ABS, is now a WHO "priority pathogen" because of its drug resistance. Though normally harmless in the gut, it becomes dangerous in immunocompromised individuals &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The third stage involves debilitating neurological symptoms, such as severe brain fog that can be so intense that patients have had to leave their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell added: ‘I have these 20-year-olds say, ‘I have to leave my job. I'm working in finance and I can't do the rigors of what I need to do,’ and I work with them and they get better.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most severe stage encompasses systemic illness, including profound chronic fatigue and body-wide pain similar to fibromyalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell's treatment begins with antifungal medication and a strict 30-day, low-carb diet to starve the yeast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then repairs the gut using targeted vitamins and nutrients to reduce inflammation and repopulate the microbiome with beneficial bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

None of them had signs of cognitive impairment at the beginning of the study. Over a period of up to 14 years, the team periodically assessed the participants — whose ages ranged from 50 to 90 — using cognitive tests and brain scans. Participants were also asked to wear pedometers to measure how many steps they took each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brains of people at a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease usually show an abnormal build-up of two proteins: &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02535-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02535-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;amyloid-β and tau&lt;/a&gt;. Although the relationship between the two proteins is not fully understood, amyloid-β levels begin to increase first, followed by tau levels. Cognitive decline seems to be more closely tied to the accumulation of tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of taking 3,000 to 7,500 steps per day were apparent only for participants with high baseline levels of amyloid-β in their brains. Their mental decline was slowed — by 3 to 7 years — compared with participants who were sedentary. The researchers didn’t see any further slowing of mental decline in participants who took more than 7,500 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But what does that mean exactly? It’s a term experts want to demystify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people can eat high-FODMAP foods without issue, as these are generally healthy foods that encourage growth of good bacteria,” says Samantha Dieras, RD, director of ambulatory nutrition services at Mount Sinai Hospital. “Persons with IBS can be more sensitive [to certain foods], and using a low-FODMAP diet to gain control of their symptoms may be helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, the experts break down everything you need to know about low-FODMAP foods and figuring out whether this is the healthiest diet for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is FODMAP?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FODMAP is an acronym: fermentable, oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. According to Dieras, FODMAP refers to short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in your small intestine and fermented by gut bacteria in the large intestine, which can lead to water being drawn into the large intestine. Eating foods with high amounts of FODMAP can cause issues such as bloating, gas, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, as well as more sensitivity for anyone with IBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/"}' href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Monash University&lt;/a&gt; in Melbourne, Australia, has created &lt;a data-offer-url="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monash-fodmap-diet/id586149216" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monash-fodmap-diet/id586149216"}' href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monash-fodmap-diet/id586149216" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an app&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to learning more about FODMAP, and it breaks down &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/"}' href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the acronym&lt;/a&gt; even further as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fermentable: something that can be fermented&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oligosaccharides: carbohydrates composed of simple sugars that can be found in foods like wheat, rye, and some legumes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disaccharides: found in dairy products, like milk, cheese, and yogurt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monosaccharides: also known as fructose; found in things like corn syrup&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Polyols: sugar alcohols known as sorbitol and mannitol that you can find in things like artificial sweeteners and also some vegetables and fruits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are low-FODMAP foods?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking at a FODMAP list, you’ll notice that many food categories have both low- and high-FODMAP foods. If you’re looking for low-FODMAP options, you can turn to the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Vegetables&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vegetables such as eggplant, beans, cucumber, and bok choy are some of the low-FODMAP options Dieras recommends adding to a low-FODMAP diet. You can eat them on their own, cook them as a side dish, or incorporate them into a salad, among other uses. The options are many, making this one of the easiest low-FODMAP food options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Fruits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monash University lists cantaloupe, kiwi, mandarin, and orange as &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/"}' href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some of the fruits&lt;/a&gt; low in polyols, making them low-FODMAP foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Meats and poultry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you like meat, Dieras advises going as plain as possible. Plain chicken, beef, turkey, lamb, or pork are the best options for low-FODMAP diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Nuts and seeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a snack or garnish, low-FODMAP nut and seed options include macadamias, peanuts, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/pumpkin-seeds"&gt;pumpkin seeds&lt;/a&gt;, and walnuts, &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/"}' href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to Monash University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should consider a low-FODMAP diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A FODMAP diet is a way for individuals with IBS or those experiencing digestive issues—such as bloating, gas, abdominal pain, or diarrhea—to identify which foods they can tolerate better, says Dieras. This will also allow the gut to rest and heal. If you aren’t experiencing much discomfort when you eat, then you are mostly okay to continue with your regular diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are there any risks to a low-FODMAP diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dieras says that a low-FODMAP diet can be restrictive, which comes with its own set of problems. “Restricting foods or food groups brings the risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, which may contribute to other health consequences,” she says. Balance here is key. You may be able to tolerate small portions of certain high-FODMAP foods or do a reintroduction phase so you don’t have to cut those foods off completely. It’s best to work with a registered dietitian or a health-care provider to determine the best and safest steps for your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the most common high-FODMAP foods?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, Dieras says it’s essential to note that high-FODMAP foods are considered healthy and shouldn’t be eliminated permanently unless necessary. However, if they are causing you issues, you need to learn how to adjust your diet in a way that suits you to improve your digestion. That said, the three most common high-FODMAP foods are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Wheat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show that wheat is &lt;a data-offer-url="https://repository.rothamsted.ac.uk/item/97788/fodmaps-in-wheat" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://repository.rothamsted.ac.uk/item/97788/fodmaps-in-wheat"}' href="https://repository.rothamsted.ac.uk/item/97788/fodmaps-in-wheat" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;high in&lt;/a&gt; oligosaccharides, so if you’re looking for better food replacements, Dieras says you can opt for quinoa and rice. Monash University also lists corn flakes, oats, and wheat-, rye-, and barley-free breads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Dairy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because dairy is &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/dairy-bone-health"&gt;a source of disaccharides&lt;/a&gt;, you might be better off with dairy alternatives. Dieras lists almond milk, lactose-free options, rice milk, cashew milk, and aged hard cheeses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Artificial Sweeteners&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners contain both monosaccharides and polyols, which makes them high on the FODMAP food list. Better alternatives include dark chocolate and maple syrup, Dieras says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 15:59:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1EcUk1RW9tTktaV0w4aEt1Z0tiWmo4cjdqQlMyS2Y0ZGd2ZUJsMS1DOUlSX0lZMDd3MXB4NlNGaXpSQ2tZTXZnaWowWHNxWDVEV3c4UUhvazBiUQ</guid></item><item><title>怀孕期间的新冠肺炎是否与自闭症有关？一项新的研究显示了什么，它没有什么- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-pregnancy-autism-research-study/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A large study from Massachusetts found that &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/9900/neurodevelopmental_outcomes_of_3_year_old_children.1392.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;babies whose mothers had COVID-19 while pregnant&lt;/a&gt; were slightly more likely to have a range of neurodevelopmental diagnoses by age 3. Most of these children had speech or motor delays, and the link was strongest when the mother was infected late in pregnancy and in boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in risk was small for any one child, but because millions of women were pregnant during the pandemic, even a small increase matters. The study doesn't prove that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy causes autism or other brain conditions in the fetus, but it suggests that infections and inflammation during pregnancy can affect how a baby's brain grows, something scientists have seen before with other illnesses. It's reason to help pregnant women avoid COVID-19 and to keep a close eye on children who were exposed in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital examined medical records from more than 18,000 mothers and their children born between March 2020 and May 2021, before vaccines were widely available. Because everyone giving birth during that period was tested for COVID, the team could clearly see which pregnancies were exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 5% of those mothers had COVID while pregnant. Their children were modestly more likely to be diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental condition by age 3 than those whose mothers weren't infected, even after accounting for differences in maternal age, race, insurance status, and preterm birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link appeared strongest when infection occurred in the third trimester and among boys. Still, the vast majority of children in both groups showed typical development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This was a very clean group to follow," said Dr. Andrea Edlow, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Mass General and one of the study's authors. "Because of universal testing early in the pandemic, we knew who had COVID and who didn't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say COVID, which causes a powerful immune response in some people, fits the biological pattern seen with other infections in pregnancy. Dr. Alan Brown, a professor of psychiatry and epidemiology at Columbia University, who studies maternal infection and brain development, explained, "COVID would be a very strong candidate for it to happen because the amount of inflammation is very extreme."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How might infection affect brain development?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are still piecing together how various types of infections in pregnancy affect fetal development. Severe illness can cause inflammation that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3978" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;disrupts brain growth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1307582110" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;trigger preterm birth&lt;/a&gt;, which carries its own risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a long history of evidence showing that maternal infection can slightly raise the risk for many neurodevelopmental disorders," said Dr. Roy Perlis, the vice chair for research in psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital and co-author of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edlow's lab is investigating how infection and inflammation may interfere with brain development. In a healthy brain, immune cells help shape developing neural circuits by trimming away extra or unnecessary connections, a process known as "synaptic pruning," which sculpts the brain's wiring. When a mother's immune system is activated by infection, inflammatory molecules can reach the fetal brain and alter the pruning process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aag3194" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Animal studies&lt;/a&gt; support Edlow's hypothesis. When scientists trigger inflammation in pregnant mice, their offspring often show changes in how brain cells grow and connect, changes that can alter learning and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why late pregnancy and why boys?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Edlow and Perlis' study, the link between COVID and developmental delays was strongest when infection occurred late in pregnancy, during the third trimester. That's also when the fetal brain is growing most rapidly, forming and refining millions of neural connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we think of organ development, we think earlier in pregnancy, but the brain is an exception in this regard, where there's a massive amount of brain development in the third trimester. And that continues after birth," said Perlis. "It is entirely plausible that the third trimester is a period of vulnerability specifically for brain development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not everyone agrees the third trimester is uniquely vulnerable. Dr. Brian Lee, a professor of epidemiology at Drexel University, cautioned that because most mothers in the study were tested at delivery, there were simply more late-pregnancy infections to analyze. "That gives the study more power to find a difference in the third trimester," he said. "It doesn't prove earlier infections aren't important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found stronger effects in boys. That pattern is familiar: boys are generally more likely than girls to have speech or motor delays and to be diagnosed with autism. Researchers suspect that male fetuses may be more sensitive to stress and inflammation before birth, though the biology isn't fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study can and can't show&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edlow and Perlis are careful to say the study shows an association, not proof that COVID infection in pregnancy causes developmental problems. &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(22)00264-4/abstract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Many other factors&lt;/a&gt; could explain the link.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mothers who get sick with COVID may also have other health issues, like obesity, diabetes or mental health conditions, that increase the risk of developmental delays in children. "Persons with &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.20806" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;mental disorders&lt;/a&gt; are much more likely to get COVID. Women with mental disorders are much &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1536042/full" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;more likely to have kids with neurodevelopmental problems&lt;/a&gt;," Lee said. "Mothers with &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2785000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;worse physical health&lt;/a&gt; are also at higher risk of having children with neurodevelopmental problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee's research has shown that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889159114004528?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;even infections before or after pregnancy can be linked to autism&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that shared genetics or environment, rather than the infection itself, could be at play. That's why experts say much larger, longer studies are needed to understand the extent of any risk from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edlow, Perlis and their team plan to follow the children in their study as they grow older to see whether early differences persist or fade. They're also studying how inflammation during pregnancy affects the placenta and fetal brain, and how to counteract those effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about vaccination?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this study followed pregnancies from early in the pandemic, before vaccines were widely available, it doesn't answer whether vaccination changes the risk. But other research offers reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large national study in Scotland &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352464225000082" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;found no difference in early developmental outcomes&lt;/a&gt; between children whose mothers were vaccinated and those who weren't. Another study in the U.S. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2814106" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;found the same&lt;/a&gt;: no link between prenatal COVID vaccination and developmental delays through 18 months. Both align with decades of data showing that vaccination during pregnancy is safe for both the mother and the baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccination is a short spike… your immune system revs up, then it goes back to normal," said Edlow. "COVID [infection] is much more prolonged, unpredictable, and people can get… a dysregulated immune phenomenon that really doesn't exist in vaccine responses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for parents and clinicians&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since late 2020, there's been widespread confusion and misinformation about the safety of COVID vaccination during pregnancy. Some women have hesitated to get vaccinated out of fear it might harm their baby. But the evidence since then has been clear: the COVID vaccine is safe in pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;strongly recommends COVID vaccination&lt;/a&gt; to protect &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-pregnancy-protects-newborn-babies-cdc-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;both mother and child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say the broader lesson is that pregnancy is a period of vulnerability, and prevention matters, not only &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-pregnancy-study-unvaccinated-pregnant-women-stillbirth/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;for COVID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but other infections as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Janet Currie, a professor of economics at Yale University, said these risks remain "underappreciated," despite decades of evidence. "Even though the flu vaccine is recommended for pregnant women, very few pregnant women get it," she said. "Physicians seem to be reluctant to vaccinate pregnant women."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Gil Mor, scientific director of the C.S. Mott Center for Human Growth and Development at Wayne State University, put it, "Protecting the mother is protecting the long-term health of the offspring. … The best intervention is vaccination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A century-old echo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that what happens in the womb can shape life after birth began with studies of famine, like the Dutch Hunger Winter in the final months of World War II. Between 1944 and 1945, as German forces blockaded the western Netherlands, rations fell to just a few hundred calories a day. Thousands died of starvation, and women who were pregnant during that period gave birth to babies who later faced higher risks of &lt;a href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/84/6/595" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)07244-9/abstract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/495981" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;. The episode became a cornerstone of the "&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(89)90710-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;fetal origins&lt;/a&gt;" idea, that deprivation or stress in pregnancy can have lifelong effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.25.3.153" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;1918 flu pandemic&lt;/a&gt; broadened that idea to infection. Babies exposed to influenza in utero later showed small but lasting &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/507154" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;differences in education and earnings&lt;/a&gt;, one of the first signs that illness during pregnancy could affect brain development. Research in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24997382/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2727135" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953611006368" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19691044/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28371628/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; found similar impacts. Some argued that those findings reflected the &lt;a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24725" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;disruptions of World War I&lt;/a&gt;, not the flu itself. But &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24725" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;later studies&lt;/a&gt;, including those from the &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41304838" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/494237" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, have strengthened the case for a biological effect, reinforcing that the infection itself, not wartime upheaval, was the key driver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It isn't simply influenza that can alter fetal neurodevelopment," Dr. Kristina Adams Waldorf, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UW Medicine, explained. "Many types of infections… in the mother can be transmitted as a signal to the fetus, which can alter its brain development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A century later, the same question has returned with COVID: could infection during pregnancy subtly shape how children grow and learn? The new Massachusetts General Hospital study offers an early look at the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

Across workplaces, classrooms, and homes, young adults are increasingly reporting difficulty focusing, recalling information, and staying mentally sharp. With modern life demanding constant multitasking, late-night scrolling, and high stress, our attention spans are paying the price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A peer-reviewed study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251102011158.htm" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease (2025)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; revealed that self-reported cognitive disabilities among US adults nearly doubled between 2013 and 2023, climbing from 5.1% to 9.7% for those under 40. Researchers say the rise is linked to chronic stress, digital overload, and social inequality, suggesting that modern habits are reshaping how young brains process memory and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 creative activities to boost brain power, sharpen memory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The growing link between young adults and memory loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was once brushed off as a distraction or burnout has evolved into a widespread cognitive concern. Young adults today face a constant barrage of notifications, deadlines, and digital input, leaving the brain with little time to recharge. This overstimulation weakens short-term memory and the ability to retain new information, while also reducing the brain’s natural downtime needed for consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that reported cases of decision-making and memory difficulties almost doubled over a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health professionals warn that this trend reflects more than lifestyle change; it’s a sign that the brain’s adaptability is being stretched beyond its limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How lifestyle and environment are reshaping young brains&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average adult spends over seven hours a day on screens. Blue light exposure, coupled with irregular sleep cycles and sedentary behaviour, disrupts the circadian rhythm, which plays a vital role in learning and memory. Continuous digital engagement also conditions the brain for instant gratification, making deep focus increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental stressors add to the problem. Air pollution, poor diet, and lack of natural sunlight have all been linked to impaired cognitive performance. Over time, these factors alter neural pathways responsible for attention control and memory retrieval, leading to what many describe as “mental fatigue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The social and economic roots of early &lt;keyword id="20097971" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="cognitive-decline" source="keywords"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent spike in cognitive difficulties cannot be understood without addressing the pressures of modern living. Economic instability, competitive workplaces, and the “always-on” culture are major triggers of chronic stress, which releases cortisol, a hormone that, in excess, damages the hippocampus, the brain’s memory centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to researchers, lower-income individuals showed the sharpest increase in cognitive complaints. Limited access to mental healthcare, nutritious food, and restful environments amplifies the risk. These findings highlight how memory health is not only a personal issue but also a social one, shaped by inequality and lifestyle demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recognising the early signs of memory strain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many young people overlook early cognitive symptoms, mistaking them for tiredness or anxiety. Warning signs include frequently forgetting recent conversations, difficulty concentrating on tasks, or losing track of time and details. Others experience emotional irritability, indecisiveness, or feeling mentally “foggy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend keeping a record of such symptoms. If forgetfulness or poor concentration lasts for more than a few weeks, it may signal deeper issues like chronic stress or sleep deprivation. Early intervention, through rest, therapy, or lifestyle changes, can help restore mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to protect your brain from digital and stress overload&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventing early memory decline starts with restoring balance. Neuroscientists suggest maintaining a consistent sleep routine, engaging in daily exercise, and prioritising nutrient-rich foods like leafy greens, berries, and fatty fish. Reducing evening screen exposure and scheduling “digital detox” hours can give the brain time to reset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness practices such as deep breathing and journaling also lower stress hormones, supporting better recall and emotional regulation. The key, experts say, is not perfection but consistency; small, daily habits compound over time to protect long-term cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The bigger picture of memory loss among young adults&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rapid rise in memory issues among young adults is a wake-up call for modern society. It reflects how our tech-driven lifestyles, high expectations, and restless routines are reshaping the mind. But it also offers hope: the brain remains adaptable and capable of healing with the right habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By rethinking how we work, rest, and connect, we can slow and even reverse this early decline. The challenge isn’t just remembering more, but living in a way that gives our minds room to breathe, focus, and thrive. When we prioritise presence over productivity and balance stimulation with stillness, we create the conditions for lasting mental clarity, emotional resilience, and genuine creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

The research indicates that using playful or childish terms for genitals in everyday life is linked to more negative outcomes, while using vulgar terms during sex is connected to more positive sexual experiences. The findings were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-025-01619-w" target="_blank"&gt;Sex Roles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many scholars and educators believe language shapes our body image, this idea has rarely been put to the test. A team of researchers led by Tanja Oschatz of Johannes-Gutenberg-University and Rotem Kahalon of Bar-Ilan University aimed to provide the missing scientific evidence, particularly regarding the terms women use for their genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For years, both feminist scholars and sex educators have emphasized that language matters—that the words we use to talk about our bodies can shape how we feel about them. Yet, despite this widely accepted idea, there was surprisingly little empirical evidence showing how this plays out with regards to women’s genitals,” Oschatz told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although there were studies from 20 year ago that catalogued the many terms women use to describe their genitals, no one had examined whether using different terms is actually linked to women’s feelings, attitudes, or behaviors. Our first goal was to close this gap.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Secondly, we wanted to update previous findings on women’s genital naming. Language is constantly evolving—especially around gender, sexuality, and the body. What women call their genitals today may carry different meanings and social implications than it did two decades ago, and we wanted to capture this contemporary picture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct their study, the researchers surveyed 457 women from the United States with diverse ages. Participants were asked what terms they most commonly use to refer to their genitals in two different scenarios: a general, non-sexual context and a partnered, sexual context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women also completed a series of questionnaires designed to measure their feelings and attitudes. These included scales assessing their genital self-image, their overall sexual pleasure, orgasm frequency, attitudes toward oral sex, and certain health-related behaviors, such as the use of vaginal cleaning products and their openness to labiaplasty, a type of cosmetic genital surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After collecting the terms, the researchers performed a content analysis and grouped the words into nine distinct categories. These categories included anatomical (e.g., “vagina,” “vulva”), vulgar (e.g., “pussy”), playful/childish (e.g., “hoo-ha,” “vajayjay”), and euphemisms (e.g., “down there,” “private parts”), among others. The team then used statistical analyses to see if using terms from a particular category was associated with the participants’ self-reported attitudes and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, non-sexual contexts, the study found that a majority of women, about 75%, reported using at least one anatomical term, with “vagina” being the most frequent. However, playful/childish terms and euphemisms were also common, each used by roughly 15% of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that genital naming among women is very diverse—and that it depends strongly on the context,” Oschatz explained. “For example, when women were asked, ‘What term do you generally use?’, the majority mentioned at least one anatomical term such as ‘vagina’ or ‘vulva.’ In contrast, when asked what term they use in a sexual context, most women reported using more informal or vulgar terms like ‘pussy.’ Compared to data from twenty years ago, we also found that the term ‘vulva’ (referring to the outer parts of women’s genitals) and words referring to the clitoris have become more common, suggesting a more differentiated and anatomically informed vocabulary today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that women who used playful/childish terms tended to report a more negative genital self-image. This connection appeared to extend to other areas as well. The use of these terms was also linked to a lower perception of a partner’s enjoyment of giving oral sex, a greater likelihood of using vaginal cleaning products, and a higher interest in getting labiaplasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that a more negative genital self-image helped explain the connection between using playful terms and the greater openness to labiaplasty, as well as the lower perceived partner enjoyment of oral sex. This suggests that the negative feelings women have about their genitals may be a key factor driving these other outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that the words women use are indeed related to their attitudes and experiences,” Oschatz told PsyPost. “Women who used childish terms such as ‘hoo-ha’ or ‘vajayjay’ tended to report more negative feelings about their genitals. These terms were also linked to sexual and health behaviors and attitudes—such as a more negative perception of partner’s oral sex enjoyment, greater use of vaginal cleaning products, and higher openness to labiaplasty.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers analyzed the terms women used in a sexual context with a partner, the linguistic landscape changed significantly. In this setting, the most common category was vulgar terms, with nearly 45% of women reporting their use. The most frequent word in this category was “pussy.” Anatomical terms were the second most common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that using vulgar terms during sex was associated with positive sexual outcomes. Women who used these terms reported experiencing greater general sexual pleasure, more frequent orgasms, and a stronger desire to receive oral sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Context really matters,” Oschatz emphasized. “The associations between language and attitudes differed depending on when the terms were used. For instance, childish terms were linked to more negative feelings only when used in non-sexual contexts, but not during sexual ones. Interestingly, using the word ‘pussy’ in sexual contexts was associated with greater sexual pleasure and more frequent orgasms. This suggests that a word once considered derogatory may now be reclaimed by many women and carry an element of empowerment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what researchers expected, the use of euphemisms was not associated with a negative genital self-image or any other adverse outcomes in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find that using euphemisms—vague and indirect terms like ‘own there’ or ‘private area’—was not associated with more negative attitudes toward women’s own genitals,” Oschatz said. “We had expected that these terms might carry an element of shame or discomfort, which could be linked to a more negative genital self-image. However, our findings suggest otherwise. Instead, it was really the use of childish language that was related to negative feelings and attitudes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, the study has some limitations. The participants were predominantly white and highly educated, so the findings may not apply to women from other racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic backgrounds where language and cultural norms may differ. The research was also focused exclusively on cisgender women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, because the study shows a correlation, it cannot determine causation. It is unclear if using certain words influences a woman’s feelings and behaviors, or if her existing feelings and behaviors influence her choice of words. It is also possible that the relationship works in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore these dynamics in more diverse populations and use methods that help establish the direction of the relationship over time. Researchers also suggest a deeper exploration into the complex nature of reclaimed terms to better understand how and when they contribute to a sense of genuine empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors note that the findings have practical implications, particularly for health and education.

    &lt;p&gt;When someone has a heart attack or heart failure, heart muscle cells are lost and the heart cannot replace them and there is no current way to grow new heart muscle cells after damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than one million people in Britain are living with heart failure, with around 200,000 new cases diagnosed each year and the only options are medications to help manage symptoms, stents, valve repairs, heart bypass or a transplant. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/heart-disease/"&gt;Heart diseases&lt;/a&gt; are currently the second-largest cause of death in Britain each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new technique harnesses the power of a naturally-occurring gene called Cyclin A2 or, CCNA2, which plays a critical role in cell division and growth during foetal development but ceases activity shortly after birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reactivating this gene enables the production of new cardiomyocytes – heart muscle cells – which can repair damaged areas of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team inserted the gene into a harmless virus and tested it directly in living adult human heart cells in culture from 41 and 55-year-old hearts. They used time-lapse imaging to analyse the heart cells with CCNA2 and saw that they began to divide successfully, keeping their structure and function and demonstrating normal protein and calcium activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that CCNA2 helps heart cells “turn back the clock” by reactivating growth genes so they can divide and repair the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Chaudhry said: “This is the culmination of nearly two decades of work. We pioneered the concept that the heart could be regenerated by reawakening dormant cell division genes, and now we’ve brought that vision one step closer to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to deliver a therapy that allows the heart to heal itself after a heart attack or in heart failure, reducing the need for transplants or mechanical devices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists are now seeking approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to begin clinical trials of CCNA2 therapy in patients with heart disease. The research was published in the journal Regenerative Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

Because energy needs change continuously, mitochondria must constantly fine-tune their activity to keep up. This adaptability depends in part on the nutrients available to the cell. Yet until recently, scientists did not fully understand how nutrients influence this process of energy adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A research group led by Professor Dr. Thorsten Hoppe at the University of Cologne's Institute for Genetics and the CECAD Cluster of Excellence on Aging Research has now identified a new biological pathway showing how the amino acid leucine strengthens mitochondrial performance. Their work reveals that leucine stabilizes important mitochondrial proteins, enhancing the organelle's ability to produce energy. The study, titled "Leucine inhibits degradation of outer mitochondrial membrane proteins to adapt mitochondrial respiration," was published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Leucine Supports Energy Production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leucine is one of the essential amino acids, meaning it must be obtained through food. It is a key component of protein synthesis and is abundant in protein-rich foods like meat, dairy products, and legumes such as beans and lentils. The researchers found that leucine helps protect certain proteins on the outer membrane of mitochondria from breaking down. These proteins are vital because they transport other metabolic molecules into the mitochondria to generate energy. By preserving them, leucine allows mitochondria to work more efficiently, resulting in higher energy output within the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were thrilled to discover that a cell's nutrient status, especially its leucine levels, directly impacts energy production," said Dr. Qiaochu Li, the study's first author. "This mechanism enables cells to swiftly adapt to increased energy demands during periods of nutrient abundance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that a protein called SEL1L plays an important role in this process. SEL1L is part of the cell's quality control system that identifies and removes faulty or misfolded proteins. Leucine seems to reduce the activity of SEL1L, which decreases the breakdown of mitochondrial proteins and improves mitochondrial performance. "Modulating leucine and SEL1L levels could be a strategy to boost energy production," said Li. "However, it is important to proceed with caution. SEL1L also plays a crucial role in preventing the accumulation of damaged proteins, which is essential for long-term cellular health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Implications for Health and Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the wider impact of their findings, the researchers studied the process in the model organism &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;. They discovered that problems in leucine metabolism can impair mitochondrial function and even cause fertility issues. When the team examined human lung cancer cells, they found that certain mutations affecting leucine metabolism actually help cancer cells survive, highlighting an important factor for future cancer treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These discoveries show that the nutrients we consume do more than simply fuel the body -- they actively influence how energy is produced inside cells. By uncovering how leucine affects mitochondrial metabolism, the study points to potential new therapeutic targets for conditions linked to reduced energy production, including cancer and metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research received support through Germany's Excellence Strategy as part of CECAD and from several Collaborative Research Centers funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Additional funding came from the European Research Council via the ERC Advanced Grant "Cellular Strategies of Protein Quality Control-Degradation" (CellularPQCD) and from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Equids, members of the horse family including horses, donkeys and zebras, share curious features called chestnuts. Found on every horse, they appear as toughened growths on their limbs, and can be clipped back if they grow too large. Anyone following the charming and rugged farrier Sam Wolfenden on TikTok will have seen his expert chestnut clipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chestnuts are fascinating little entities – &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41012771/"&gt;remnants of toe pads&lt;/a&gt; that were present in the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/prehistoric-520"&gt;prehistoric&lt;/a&gt; relatives of both domestic and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/wild-horses-44720"&gt;wild horses&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also unique to each animal; you can think of them as an individual fingerprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chestnuts are made of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0079642515000596"&gt;keratin&lt;/a&gt;, the same material found in the outer layer of skin. It’s protective, waterproof and durable, giving resilience and strength. It’s also found in hair and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-your-nails-can-tell-you-about-your-health-232687"&gt;nails&lt;/a&gt;, which allow for important functions like trapping heat and providing sensory information to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Samuel Wolfenden is a farrier who often shares social media posts of chestnut removals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hooves and horns of animals are no different. Keratin-based and developed from the skin, they are designed for functions such as protection or even as weapons in battle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keratin therefore plays an important role across both human and animal species. And since we’re all built from similar biological materials, it may not surprise you that humans can develop horns too – though not quite like a horse or goat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Human horns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcds.org.uk/clinical-guidance/cutaneous-horn"&gt;Cutaneous horns&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;cornu cutaneum&lt;/em&gt;, are compacted keratin masses that grow outward from a person’s skin. Their typically curved shape and hardened texture make them look like the horns of a goat, sheep or cow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can vary in colour from yellow to brown to grey. Their relative shade depends on the amount of pigment and dead cells trapped within the keratin as it builds up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutaneous horns develop from skin lesions of various kinds, and many are harmless. Several common benign lesions such as &lt;a href="https://patient.info/skin-conditions/warts-and-verrucas-leaflet/seborrhoeic-warts"&gt;seborrhoeic keratoses&lt;/a&gt; – warty swellings extremely common in older people – can develop into these “horns”. So can other warts, including those caused by the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/hpv-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-common-virus-linked-to-cancer-263678"&gt;human papilloma virus (HPV)&lt;/a&gt;, a group of viruses that infect the skin and mucous membranes and can lead to either warts or, in rarer cases, cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Around &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39896306/"&gt;16-20%&lt;/a&gt; of cutaneous horns are malignant, developing from skin cancers such as &lt;a href="https://www.kingstonandrichmond.nhs.uk/patients-and-families/patient-leaflets/squamous-cell-carcinoma-scc"&gt;squamous cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt;. This form of cancer starts in the outer layer of the skin and can invade deeper tissues if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others arise from premalignant conditions: skin changes that have not yet become cancerous but have the potential to do so. A prime example is an &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/actinic-keratoses/"&gt;actinic (or solar) keratosis&lt;/a&gt;, which can later develop into squamous cell cancer, sometimes forming a horn but often not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these cases, the cells within the lesion become denatured, losing their normal structure and function. This uncontrolled growth can lead to excessive keratin production, occasionally resulting in the formation of a horn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who develop cutaneous horns, whether benign, premalignant or cancerous, tend to share some &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cutaneous-horn"&gt;similar risk factors&lt;/a&gt;. These horns are far more common in older adults and in those with fair skin, and they often appear on sun-exposed areas such as the head or face, suggesting that ultraviolet (UV) light plays a major role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun damage is a key cause of all skin cancers including &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/melanoma-skin-cancer/"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt;, the most dangerous form. Unlike squamous cell cancer, melanoma originates in pigment-producing cells and spreads more aggressively through the body if not caught early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Grow to astonishing sizes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cutaneous horns appear in stranger places, including the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11719372/"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; and even the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40896729/"&gt;genitals&lt;/a&gt;. And because they can sometimes be linked to cancer, anyone who notices one should see a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their appearance can be distressing, especially when they form on visible areas like the face, and they may also cause discomfort or irritation. &lt;a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/cutaneous-horn"&gt;Treatment&lt;/a&gt; usually involves surgical removal of the horn and a small amount of surrounding skin, a procedure known as excision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cutaneous horns can grow to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36742859/"&gt;astonishing sizes&lt;/a&gt;. In 2024, an elderly woman in China made headlines because of a &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/107-year-old-chinese-grandmas-devil-horn-credited-for-her-long-life/"&gt;large cutaneous horn&lt;/a&gt; that grew from her forehead, reaching ten centimetres over seven years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others have earned nicknames like “unicorn horns” when they sprout from the centre of a person’s forehead. Alternatively, &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7473687/Indian-man-74-four-inch-devil-horn-removed-head.html"&gt;a patient in India&lt;/a&gt; was reported to have a “devil’s horn” growing from the top of his head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the record for the biggest cutaneous horn probably &lt;a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/114789-longest-human-horn"&gt;belongs to Madame Dimanche&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Widow Sunday, in the early 19th century. This French woman’s horn stretched nearly 25cm, hanging past her chin before it was removed. A wax cast of both her face and the horn are now displayed among other anatomical curiosities in the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever notice a hard, growing bump that looks even faintly horn-like, don’t wait. Get it checked by your GP in order to guide the most appropriate treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Caffeine and sugar-spiked energy drinks promise a quick pick-me-up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yet experts say that frequently consuming these drinks could be harming your liver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you need a little extra energy, try a cup of unsweetened coffee or tea instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reaching for a caffeinated drink can help kickstart your day or power you through an afternoon slump. In fact, 90% of us consume caffeine on a daily basis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But if you usually get your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8061814/are-energy-drinks-healthy/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;caffeine kick from an energy drink&lt;/a&gt;, it could spell trouble for your liver health. “Energy drinks are defined as over-the-counter commercial beverages with high caffeine content that are advertised to boost energy, including mental alertness and physical performance,” says &lt;a href="https://atlanticcoastgastro.com/physicians/sandhya-shukla-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sandhya Shukla, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;  While they may seem like harmless, fizzy alternatives to coffee, they affect your body–and your liver–very differently than the average cup of joe. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Read on to find out what the experts have to say about energy drinks and your liver health, plus their suggestions for healthier alternatives to keep you energized. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-energy-drinks-may-be-harming-your-liver"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Energy Drinks May Be Harming Your Liver &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Can Deliver Lots of Caffeine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Caffeine is a natural stimulant that can help you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-for-more-energy-today-11770029" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;feel more energized and alert&lt;/a&gt;. But you can have too much of a good thing. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that adults consume no more than &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009784/how-much-caffeine-is-too-much/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;400 milligrams of caffeine per day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A 12-ounce energy drink can contain anywhere from 40 mg of caffeine on the low end, to 250 mg on the high end (and 16-ounce cans may pack even more). So, if you down a couple of cans a day, you could be consuming &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-sources-of-caffeine-8647888" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;unhealthy amounts of caffeine&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What does all of this mean for your liver? As your body’s primary detoxification system, your liver has to process that flood of caffeine. While the occasional energy drink isn’t likely to cause liver problems, regularly drinking large amounts of highly caffeinated ones could lead to liver injury over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Coffee, by comparison, has been linked to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-better-liver-health-11800733" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better liver health&lt;/a&gt;, most likely due to its more than 1,000 bioactive compounds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To complicate matters, energy drinks can be marketed as supplements. When they are, they aren’t required by law to list their caffeine on the Nutrition Facts panel. That means you could be getting a lot more caffeine than you bargained for.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Can be Packed with Added Sugars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It doesn’t help that energy drinks are super-sweet, says &lt;a href="http://gooseberry-health.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Isabel Balady, RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike naturally bitter coffee or tea, it’s easy to guzzle a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/102230/shocking-levels-of-sugar-in-8-popular-beverages/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sugary-sweet energy drink&lt;/a&gt; just like soda. Those sugars may be great for providing an initial rush of energy. But it’s usually short-lived and can leave you feeling drained later on. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since your liver is responsible for ensuring that your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-ways-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check-11791785" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood sugar levels remain steady&lt;/a&gt;, consuming too much added sugar day after day can adversely impact your liver health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, research has found that regularly drinking sugar-sweetened beverages–like energy drinks–can cause fat to build up in the liver. This may lead to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/having-diabetes-can-increase-your-risk-of-liver-disease-heres-what-you-can-do-to-help-8399481" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nonalcoholic fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt; (NAFLD).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Over time, this can impair liver function and cause inflammation,” explains &lt;a href="http://www.oswalddigestiveclinic.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marcie Vaske, M.S., LN, CNS&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How much sugar are we talking about? Some energy drinks pack 54 to 62 grams of sugar per 16-ounce can. To put that into perspective, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting added sugar to no more than 10% of daily calories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s roughly 12 teaspoons (or 50 grams) of added sugar for someone who eats about 2,000 calories a day. So, should you be reaching for a sugar-free energy drink instead? While these may seem like a healthier choice, there’s new evidence that even &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-surprising-drink-that-could-increase-your-risk-of-heart-disease-11705434" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;artificially-sweetened drinks&lt;/a&gt; may raise your odds of liver disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Can Contain Harmful Doses of Supplements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Energy drinks often contain a cocktail of supplemental ingredients like vitamins and minerals, as well as herbs like guarana and ginkgo biloba. These ingredients are often marketed as “natural,”  which makes them seem wholesome. But it’s your liver's job to process them all. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One seemingly innocent ingredient commonly added to energy drinks is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-vitamin-b-complex-8669791" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, B vitamins play an active role in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291451/will-vitamin-b12-give-me-energy/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;energy metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. However, energy drinks often contain considerably more than we really need, even to the point that they may be harmful to your liver. For example, niacin is an important B vitamin, but too much of it can potentially lead to liver toxicity. Some research has even linked high-niacin energy drinks to the development of hepatitis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-healthier-alternatives"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Healthier Alternatives &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The occasional energy drink is OK for most healthy people. However, if you’re frequently relying on their higher wattage to keep you awake and alert, it may be time to find a healthier alternative, like one of these: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee:&lt;/strong&gt; Many people love the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;caffeine boost of a cup of joe&lt;/a&gt;. Coffee also happens to be packed with loads of health-promoting compounds. Some of these may actually lower the risk of liver disease when consumed in moderate amounts, says Balady.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tea: &lt;/strong&gt;While green and black tea have less caffeine than coffee, they contain an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7866840/foods-to-eat-to-stay-energized/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;energy-boosting amino acid&lt;/a&gt; called L-theanine. This amino acid has been shown to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7907172/what-are-nootropics/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;promote attention and focus&lt;/a&gt;, without the jitters of caffeine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water: &lt;/strong&gt;Being dehydrated can leave you sluggish. Instead of reaching for caffeine, try a glass of water first. If plain water is a turn-off, Vaske recommends &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-ingredient-to-upgrade-your-water-fruit-11783370" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;water infused with a little fruit&lt;/a&gt; to support hydration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-Fat Milk&lt;/strong&gt;: Sure, milk doesn’t contain caffeine. But that doesn’t mean it can’t give you a bit of the energy you’re looking for. Thanks to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-electrolytes-8645417" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;electrolytes, like potassium&lt;/a&gt;, milk is an excellent choice for fending off dehydration. Plus, its &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;natural sugars&lt;/a&gt; can boost energy levels while its protein helps sustain them for longer. A winning combo if you ask us! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Marketed as energy in a bottle with enticing flavors like “Watermelon Wave”, “Sherbet Swirl” or “Punched Hardcore Apple,” it’s no wonder energy drinks are skyrocketing in popularity. While they may seem like innocent alternatives to coffee, experts warn that their combination of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-do-if-you-drink-too-much-coffee-in-the-am-11758446" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excessive caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, added sugars and supplemental ingredients can pose potential health risks for your liver. While the occasional quick fix of an energy drink is OK for most of us, making them your go-to could spell trouble for your health, especially your liver. Next time you need a kick, grab a cup of unsweetened coffee or tea. They’re loaded with compounds that protect your liver and are likely lower in caffeine than most energy drinks. Plus, they’re naturally sugar-free. No matter which drink you choose for energy, don’t forget the basics, like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-disturb-your-sleep-8551851" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, adequate hydration and plenty of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290550/10-everyday-superfoods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy, whole foods&lt;/a&gt;. They’ll keep your energy levels up in the long run, far better than any drink can.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EatingWell</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE1FVU4wVXlSdTJHdVl3Q08zTTYzT2VZTXZBYkZWYjZBbWtNSzJGVjU2bWNoTkJwNWlJdzhmZHBNY1BtYXAxQW1RaE1ZdnBUM2RDZVZYenZGODY5VXV3cDUwRUZITUVZWkRzOUQ1OHl1dDFCb1Q2YmRjbDFiVEY5QQ</guid></item><item><title>健康影响者依赖垃圾科学- UnHerd</title><link>https://unherd.com/newsroom/wellness-influencers-are-relying-on-junk-science/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pianocontentwrapper"&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;There’s a new kind of health revolution happening online. Forget rushed GP appointments and overbooked clinics — today’s health experts are wellness gurus who wear yoga pants, talk cortisol levels, and sell empowerment. Last week, the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/birth-control-hormone-health-78f15942?mod=hp_lead_pos10" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was the latest outlet to show how “hormone balance” and “wellness” have become both diagnosis and cure, promising that better sleep, clearer skin and calmer moods can be achieved through supplements and an unwavering commitment to this new lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent1" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before people dismiss this movement, it’s important to remember that beneath the soft lighting and wellness tonics lies a harder truth — a growing number of women have justifiably lost faith in medicine. They’re tired of being misunderstood, overprescribed, or told that their problems are “just hormones”. And into that space has swept the wellness industry — part rebellion, part exploitation of women’s worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s little wonder that many women are looking elsewhere for answers, not from experts in white coats, but from each other. Former athlete and registered nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/whatthemenopause/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Jessica Barac&lt;/a&gt; was hit with crippling anxiety, extreme fatigue, and sudden crying jags during an unexpected perimenopause in her late 30s. Unimpressed by the information available, she began sharing her experiences of the non-medicalised wellness industry online. Now, more than a million people follow her advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories like hers explain why the wellness economy has exploded. Wellness isn’t a medical revolution so much as a beautifully branded rebellion. The dull, sensible advice of your harried GP — sleep well, eat healthily, exercise often — has been replaced by glossy promises of health and happiness through supplements and tonics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wellness industry has extended far beyond vitamins and minerals. Los Angeles photographer Masha Maltsava has cleared her home of “forever chemicals”, swapped her cookware for cast iron, and banished her polyester leggings. She now tracks her stress levels with an Oura ring and uses AI to interpret her lab results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But herein lies the problem with relying on the wellness industry. What began as a justifiable search for better information has morphed into a multi-million-pound industry. This is where “first, do no harm” collides with “buyer beware”. The tragedy is that women aren’t wrong to seek better or non-pharmaceutical care for certain ailments — the worry is that they’re being sold certainty in place of science. It’s easy to mock those who turn to influencers instead of doctors, but in a world that demands answers, someone will always be waiting to sell you one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take 28-year-old content creator Carly Hataway, who spoke to the &lt;i&gt;WSJ&lt;/i&gt; about her experience. After years of trying to understand her hormones and why she seemed to be so affected by fluctuations, she wasn’t convinced when her doctor told her to go back on the pill. So she turned instead to an alternative health practitioner who ordered a battery of blood and urine tests. “I finally figured out that my cortisol was really high and that my progesterone and my oestrogen [sic] were low,” said Hataway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, of course, she posted the results to her 70,000 TikTok followers. The flood of support that followed shows why this world is so seductive: rejecting your doctor’s bad advice feels like independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great irony in all this is that the wellness ecosystem is driven by profit. Influencers with something to sell thrive on creating a sense that their target market is missing something in their lives. All the while, the efficacy of the wellness industry is increasingly questionable. Little of this is evidence-based, and most of the research is extremely limited. Influencers often lean heavily on phrases like “preliminary findings” and “emerging science”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this trend exposes is a broader collapse of trust in expertise. In this case, the old medical paternalism hasn’t been replaced by better self-guided care, but by naked consumerism resting on junk science.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;/div&gt;

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), "An estimated 1.4 billion adults aged 30–79 years worldwide had hypertension in 2024; this represents 33% of the population in this age range." However, high blood pressure often doesn't show clear symptoms until it is too late. "An estimated 600 million adults with hypertension (44%) are unaware that they have the condition," the WHO states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so, your lifestyle-- which includes your everyday diet plays a huge role in managing it. Certain foods can help relax blood vessels, reduce sodium levels, and improve heart health, while others can silently push your blood pressure higher. Thus, making simple changes in your food habits can show great effects on your overall well-being. Here we list some of the best foods one should have and the worst foods one should avoid for high blood pressure (BP):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 13:14:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-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</guid></item></channel></rss>
