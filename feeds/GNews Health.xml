			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydralazine"&gt;Hydralazine&lt;/a&gt; has been used to treat &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-pressure-guidelines-mean-you-may-now-have-hypertension"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; for many decades, even though it's never been exactly clear how it works. Now a new study answers some key questions about the medication – and adds an intriguing new link to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-7-warning-signs-of-brain-cancer-you-might-easily-miss"&gt;brain cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a closer look at the effects of hydralazine on human and mouse cells, researchers led by a team from the University of Pennsylvania found that it blocks a particular enzyme called 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same enzyme, as it happens, is thought to play a role in aggressive &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/brain-tumours/types/glioblastoma"&gt;glioblastoma brain cancers&lt;/a&gt;. This new understanding of hydralazine could lead the way to new  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="182732" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatments, as well as improve the drug's effectiveness for its current targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/serotonin-could-play-an-unexpected-role-in-cancer-scientists-discover"&gt;Serotonin Could Play an Unexpected Role in Cancer, Scientists Discover&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hydralazine is one of the earliest vasodilators ever developed, and it's still a first-line treatment for preeclampsia – a hypertensive disorder that accounts for 5-15 percent of maternal deaths worldwide," &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-chemistry-serendipitous-find-leads-lifesaving-discoveries"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; physician-scientist Kyosuke Shishikura, from the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It came from a 'pre-target' era of drug discovery, when researchers relied on what they saw in patients first and only later tried to explain the biology behind it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182735" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182735" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CancerDiagram.jpg" alt="Cancer action diagram" class="wp-image-182735 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CancerDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CancerDiagram-600x415.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182735" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The ADO enzyme catalyzes reactions that produce hypotaurine, which increases cancer growth. (Shishikura et al., &lt;em&gt;Sci. Adv.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers describe ADO as an "alarm bell" that alerts the body to dropping oxygen levels. It triggers a chain reaction, tightening blood vessels by destroying so-called RGS proteins (short for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulator_of_G_protein_signaling"&gt;regulators of G-protein signaling&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41420-020-00398-5"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that glioblastoma tumors are often high in ADO, hijacking it to produce a chemical called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotaurine"&gt;hypotaurine&lt;/a&gt;, which helps the cancer cells spread, survive for longer, and tolerate stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no ADO inhibitors were known prior to this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydralazine effectively mutes ADO, the team found: RGS proteins aren't attacked, blood vessels aren't squeezed, and blood pressure drops. In experiments with human &lt;span&gt;glioblastoma&lt;/span&gt; cells, hydralazine halted &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breast-cancer-spreads-more-aggressively-at-night-startling-new-study-finds"&gt;tumor growth&lt;/a&gt; by blocking ADO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's very early days – t&lt;span&gt;he effects of hydralzine still need to be tested in people with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-deadliest-kind-of-brain-cancer-may-have-a-promising-new-treatment"&gt;glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt; in clinical trials – &lt;/span&gt;but these are promising findings that could unlock a way to control the spread of these &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nasal-drops-could-help-fight-a-common-and-deadly-brain-cancer"&gt;notoriously hard-to-treat&lt;/a&gt; brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly uncovered mechanism also explains why hydralazine is an effective treatment for preeclampsia, a high blood pressure condition in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pregnancy-ages-a-persons-cells-but-some-may-undergo-an-unexpected-rejuvenation"&gt;pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;. That means the drug can be better engineered and personalized, to reduce side effects and improve results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding how hydralazine works at the molecular level offers a path toward safer, more selective treatments for pregnancy-related hypertension – potentially improving outcomes for patients who are at greatest risk," &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-chemistry-serendipitous-find-leads-lifesaving-discoveries"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; chemist Megan Matthews, from the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discoveries here mean better drugs for both &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-pressure-guidelines-mean-you-may-now-have-hypertension"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and brain cancer can now be developed, carefully balancing the need to hit particular pathways in cells while minimizing harm to healthy parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And since hydralazine is already widely used, understanding its mechanism of action gives scientists something of a head start if they want to build more treatments based on the compound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further down the line, we might be able to take out one of the key defenses of glioblastoma, adding to the treatments &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-therapy-obliterates-deadly-brain-tumor-in-days"&gt;already in development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's rare that an old cardiovascular drug ends up teaching us something new about the brain," &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-chemistry-serendipitous-find-leads-lifesaving-discoveries"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Matthews, "but that's exactly what we're hoping to find more of – unusual links that could spell new solutions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adx7687"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                Fever is part of the immune system's response to a pathogen, one that's shared with many animal species.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For centuries, the nature of a fever — and whether it's good or bad — has been hotly contested.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In ancient Greece, the physician Hippocrates thought that fever had useful qualities, and could cook an illness out of a patient. Later on, around the 18th century, many physicians regarded fever as a distinct illness, one that could actually cook the patient, and so should be treated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These days, researchers understand that fever is part of&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/12/nx-s1-5580487/immune-health-test-immunome-precision-medicine" target="_blank"&gt; the immune system's response&lt;/a&gt; to a pathogen, one that's shared by many animal species. And while there's accumulating evidence that fevers can help kick an infection, precisely how they can help remains mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"There's a cultural knowledge that there's this relationship between temperature and viruses, but at a molecular level, we're quite unsure how temperature might be impacting viruses," says Sam Wilson,&lt;a href="https://www.immunology.cam.ac.uk/staff/professor-sam-wilson" target="_blank"&gt; a microbiologist at the University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;There are two main ideas, he says. The heat of a fever itself could be harming the virus, akin to Hippocrates' hypotheses. Alternatively, the heat is a means to an end, either stoking our immune system to work better, or simply a regrettable, but unavoidable byproduct of fighting off an infection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The fact that there weren't definitive answers to these questions piqued my interest," says Wilson. That interest &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq4691?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D82649840174138400580474904999936302642%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1764178729" target="_blank"&gt;led to a study, published Thursday&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, that suggests — at least in mice — that elevated temperature alone is enough to fight off some viruses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Reaching this conclusion was tricky, says Wilson, since it's very difficult to disentangle the effects of a fever itself from the immune response that usually comes with it. "The stars had to align," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To put this question to the test, Wilson and his colleagues first needed a pathogen. They settled &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5600125/bird-flu-risk-outbreak-trump-administration" target="_blank"&gt;on bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, because birds run hotter than humans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The influenza A viruses that infect birds target their guts, which are a few degrees warmer than the airways favored by human influenza viruses. "This means that bird flus are adapted to replicate at a higher temperature, a temperature equivalent to that of a human fever," says Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The researchers pinpointed a part of the bird flu genome that helps the virus thrive in this warm environment, called PB1. They then inserted this heat-tolerant snippet into a human flu virus. This gave them two nearly identical versions of influenza, a normal human one, and a heat-tolerant one.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Those two strains allowed the researchers to ask what impact this ability to replicate at different temperatures might have on disease. They needed an animal to test the question, and laboratory mice turned out to be ideally suited.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It just so happens mice don't mount their own fever to an influenza infection," says Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So the team simulated one by housing some mice at slightly elevated temperatures. Then they exposed the mice to either the normal human influenza virus, or the heat-tolerant version.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Under normal laboratory temperatures, mice infected with both strains got sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But when the team turned up the heat, a key difference emerged. Mice infected with the heat-resistant strain got sick, but those infected with the normal strain seemed relatively unscathed, suggesting the heat itself helped fight off the flu.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This study reinforces the idea that temperature alone is an important and effective," part of the body's attempt to respond to infection, says Daniel Barreda, &lt;a href="https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/dbarreda" target="_blank"&gt;a microbiologist at the University of Alberta&lt;/a&gt; who wasn't involved in the research. But he says the study doesn't rule out that fever also helps the immune system work better, which could be important for fighting off viruses that aren't as sensitive to temperature as influenza.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Joe Alcock,&lt;a href="https://vivo.health.unm.edu/display/n7040" target="_blank"&gt; an emergency physician and researcher&lt;/a&gt; at the University of New Mexico, also praises the study. But he points out that we shouldn't assume fevers work the same way in humans as they do in mice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, Alcock says the study adds to the growing body of evidence that fever evolved for a reason. As a physician trained by a health care system that's often quick to treat fevers, that gives him pause.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We treat fevers as almost like a knee jerk reaction, giving medicines like acetaminophen or tylenol," he says. Of course, in many circumstances treating fever is appropriate, since those high temperatures can damage human cells, too. But he says it should raise questions about when we should reach for Tylenol or ibuprofen when we've got a viral cold.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Is it possible that by taking Tylenol or ibuprofen for a viral infection, that I might be actually making it tougher for my body to get rid of the infection?" says Alcock. "That's as yet an unanswered question."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move Over, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/health/what-the-science-says-about-tylenol-autism-ahead-of-rfk-jr-report/"&gt;Tylenol&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/advance-article/doi/10.1210/clinem/dgaf596/8339900?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that a common — but often overlooked — pregnancy complication may increase your chances of having a child with &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/09/health/the-4-new-subtypes-of-autism-explained/"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt; (ASD).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news? If you treat it, the risk doesn’t seem to rise. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Researchers are exploring how various prenatal conditions might affect the risk of autism.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;pressmaster – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers looked at more than 51,000 women in Israel who gave birth between 2011 and 2017. Of them, 4,409 had abnormal thyroid hormone levels — some before pregnancy, some during and some both. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team followed the women through January 2021 and found that thyroid dysfunction before and during pregnancy more than doubled the chances of their child having autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;1 in 31 children age 8 and older in the US&lt;/a&gt; has been diagnosed with ASD, a disorder affecting learning, behavior, communication and social interaction.  &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered that the longer the thyroid problems lasted, the higher the likelihood of autism became. For example, children whose mothers had low thyroid hormone levels through all three trimesters faced more than three times the risk of being diagnosed with autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there’s a silver lining: when thyroid problems were properly controlled during pregnancy, the risk didn’t rise significantly.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We found that while adequately treated chronic thyroid dysfunction was not associated with increased autism risk in offspring, ongoing imbalance across multiple trimesters was,” &lt;a href="https://www.idanme.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Idan Menashe&lt;/a&gt;, a senior lecturer at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and one of the study’s authors, said in &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1106734" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hyperthyroidism occurs when the gland is overactive and produces too many hormones, whereas hypothyroidism occurs when it produces too few. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;amazing studio – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland at the front of your neck, just below the Adam’s apple. It produces hormones that regulate your metabolism, energy levels and other vital functions.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Those hormones are also critical for fetal brain development, especially early in pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They help neurons grow, move and form connections, which is essential for communication in the brain. Thyroid hormones also support the development of brain structures and the production of myelin, the fatty coating that helps nerve signals travel quickly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thyroid disease — an umbrella term for conditions that affect the gland’s ability to produce hormones — is the second most common endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When left untreated during pregnancy, thyroid problems have been linked to miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, premature birth, low birth weight and potential long-term effects on the child.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet in the US and many countries, routine thyroid testing isn’t part of standard pregnancy care, according to &lt;a href="https://www.palomahealth.com/learn/tylenol-vaccines-maternal-hypothyroidism-adhd-autism?srsltid=AfmBOor9ZS32uuxEScUiyWLc7LY590y_Bk0YVVphuztRE_9RdGx1pEVH" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Paloma Health&lt;/a&gt;, a virtual clinic specializing in patients with thyroid conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Autism is a developmental disorder that can lead to social, communication and behavioral challenges.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;ÃÂ¡ÃÂ²ÃÂµÃâÃÂ»ÃÂ°ÃÂ½ÃÂ° ÃÅÃÂ¸Ãâ°ÃÂµÃÂ½ÃÂºÃÂ¾ – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors usually only check if a woman has risk factors — like a personal or family history of thyroid problems, autoimmune conditions or past pregnancy complications — or if she shows symptoms like fatigue, weight changes or a rapid heartbeat. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That leaves a lot of women flying under the radar. In fact, up to 60% of people with thyroid disease don’t even know they have it, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.thyroid.org/media-main/press-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Thyroid Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;As a result, many moms-to-be may have untreated thyroid problems, which could put their child at a higher risk for autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These findings underscore the need for routine monitoring and timely adjustment of therapy to maintain normal thyroid hormone levels throughout pregnancy,” Menashe said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Untreated thyroid issues during pregnancy have also been linked to other neurodevelopmental disorders, like &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/23/health/1-in-9-us-children-diagnosed-with-adhd/"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0040-1717073" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;large US study in 2020&lt;/a&gt; found that children whose mothers had underactive thyroids with low hormone levels shortly before or early in pregnancy were 24% more likely to develop ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our findings make clear that thyroid health likely has a much larger role in fetal brain development and behavioral disorders like ADHD than we previously understood,” Dr. Morgan R. Peltier, a professor at NYU Long Island School of Medicine and the study’s lead author, said in &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/reduced-hormone-supply-pregnant-mothers-linked-adhd-their-children"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We know &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-5-minute-workout-each-day-can-still-make-a-huge-health-difference"&gt;exercise is good for us&lt;/a&gt;, but scientists are still figuring out why, at the most fundamental and molecular level. A new small but long-term study may have yielded a crucial answer, identifying the metabolite betaine as a key driver of the benefits of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betaine, a small molecule found in foods like sugar beets and spinach, has previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01070"&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to improved health, but it hasn't been connected to exercise before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, a team led by researchers from the Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University in China found that long-term exercise boosts levels of betaine in the body, via the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, betaine can mimic some of the beneficial effects of exercise, especially the slowing of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-five-simple-habits-are-key-to-slowing-aging-experts-reveal"&gt;biological aging&lt;/a&gt; (aka geroprotection). It may be that this molecule could help us live healthier lives for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-form-of-exercise-improves-sleep-the-most-study-finds"&gt;One Form of Exercise Improves Sleep The Most, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study gives us a fresh way to turn how our body works into something we can target with chemicals," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251113071620.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biophysicist Liu Guang-Hui, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It opens the door to geroprotective treatments that can tweak how multiple organs work together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183071" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183071" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/LiverPicture.jpg" alt="Liver disease picture" class="wp-image-183071 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/LiverPicture.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/LiverPicture-600x298.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183071" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;One of the effects of betaine in mice was to reduce fat buildup in the liver (right) compared to untreated controls (left). (&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/1079811"&gt;Guang-Hui Liu's lab&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at the effects of exercise on 13 healthy male volunteers, using an approach called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiomics"&gt;multi-omics&lt;/a&gt; to measure changes in the body happening at the most basic levels, across genes, proteins, the immune system, and small molecules such as betaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a single 5-kilometer (3.1-mile) run, the researchers noticed a sharp, short stress response. However, after a month of regular running, there was a more permanent upgrade in several areas, including reduced cell aging and damage, and a healthier gut microbiome and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-discovered-a-special-type-of-immune-cell-that-slows-aging"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key discovery: The kidneys in these volunteers were producing much more betaine. Through tests on mice, the researchers established that betaine blocks an enzyme called TBK1, which has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmed.2016.04.006"&gt;already been linked&lt;/a&gt; to inflammation and aging in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, higher betaine levels aren't just a consequence of sticking to steady, long-term exercise – these chemical boosts are actually a driving force behind some of the benefits that exercise brings with it, especially when it comes to anti-aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study delineated the molecular blueprint through which exercise reshapes human physiology, providing mechanistic insights into its health benefits," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.07.030"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The identified exercise-induced factors, including betaine, offer potential for developing 'exercise in a pill' to promote healthy aging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to acknowledge that the researchers aren't suggesting that we could all soon be popping pills instead of visiting the gym. There are plenty of exercise benefits not covered in this research, including increased &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-links-muscle-strengthening-activities-to-a-lower-risk-of-dying"&gt;muscle strength&lt;/a&gt; and better &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-5-minute-workout-each-day-can-still-make-a-huge-health-difference"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is the potential to use betaine and the other biological changes discovered here to inform the development of medications that could reduce the risk of age-related disease and keep the body in better shape – whether that's for people getting older or for those who &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-with-long-covid-show-abnormalities-in-muscle-structure"&gt;can't exercise&lt;/a&gt; for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much more work needs to be done here, in studies across much larger groups of people and covering much longer &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-at-one-stage-of-life-may-cut-dementia-risk-by-up-to-45"&gt;periods of exercise&lt;/a&gt;. But the discovery of betaine's vital role is a promising lead that researchers could explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This redefines 'exercise as medicine'," Guang-Hui &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251113071620.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.07.030"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But for the time being, you can happily walk in the forest, eat chicken and eggs and enjoy your life. The pandemic risk is a possibility.

It’s something no parent ever wants to see, especially after a week filled with medical teams, machines, and emotional exhaustion. So &lt;strong&gt;Prince&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/fluffy-golden-retriever-making-rounds-senior-home-pure-sunshine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;therapy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/dogs/golden-retriever-names" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, was called in to do what he does best: bring joy when it’s needed most. And wow, did he deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Not only did he manage to pull out a smile from this sweet, blonde toddler once, but he also stuck around for more of Rockford’s physical therapy sessions, offering comfort in the way only a dog can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You can see the moment that might make you a little teary in this &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRVNh_eifX0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Instagram video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Instagram video&lt;/a&gt; shared by &lt;strong&gt;@&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/theshaversfam/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:theshaversfam;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;theshaversfam&lt;/a&gt; on November 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rockford’s smile could truly light up a city. It’s hard to imagine what it was like for his parents to watch him struggle to find joy after such a major surgery, but this is where dogs shine. They don’t need instructions or training manuals for moments like this. They just show up with a full heart and let the love do the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/dogs/happiest-dog-breeds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: 7 Happiest Dog Breeds That Are Pure Sunshine to Be Around, According to Experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Related: 7 Happiest Dog Breeds That Are Pure Sunshine to Be Around, According to Experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For Prince, all it took was a gentle game of fetch to bring out Rockford’s bright eyes and those soft giggles. Golden Retrievers have that famously warm, friendly way of easing into your space without ever feeling overwhelming, and Prince seemed to know exactly what this little boy needed. A wagging tail, a soft head to pet, and the steady presence of a dog who understands emotions better than most humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fans felt it too. One viewer wrote, “Just beautiful to watch the joy and smiles the Golden Prince brings to this little boy, Rockford.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;@kimos_mile added, “Dogs are healers and man’s best friend… so good to see you smile, young man!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And @winniejules cheered, “His little pink cheeks and smile!” It’s hard to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a follow-up video posted November 24, Rockford looked into the camera and said, “I am strong, I am brave. I can do anything.” And he’s right. Especially when he’s got a Golden Retriever in his corner, brightening those moments that are dark and heavy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A happy Golden Retriever smiles for the camera.Image via Unsplash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Therapy Dogs Support Kids During Medical Recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Alliance of Therapy Dogs&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.therapydogs.com/ways-therapy-dogs-can-help-kids/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Therapy Dogs can help;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Therapy Dogs can help&lt;/a&gt; reduce anxiety, help children feel more secure in medical settings, and help them stay upbeat during therapy.

Yet scientists are discovering that this everyday drink may be doing far more in the body than quenching thirst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study has shown that regular orange juice consumption can influence the activity of thousands of genes inside our immune cells. Many of these genes help control &lt;a href="/topic/blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, calm &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and manage the way the body processes &lt;a href="/topic/sugar"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;, all of which play an important role in long-term heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study followed adults who drank 500ml of pure pasteurised orange juice every day for two months. After 60 days, many genes associated with &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and higher &lt;a href="/topic/blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; had become less active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These included NAMPT, IL6, IL1B and NLRP3, which usually switch on when the body is under stress. Another gene known as SGK1, which affects the kidneys’ ability to hold onto sodium (salt), also became less active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such changes match previous findings that daily orange juice drinking can reduce blood pressure in young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-awdjp1-0 iDKkCP"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/21/14/28/iStock-1437883817.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/21/14/28/iStock-1437883817.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/11/21/14/28/iStock-1437883817.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Previous findings suggested that daily orange juice drinking can reduce blood pressure in young adults" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-17647"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Previous findings suggested that daily orange juice drinking can reduce blood pressure in young adults&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is noteworthy because it offers a possible explanation for why orange juice has been linked to better heart health in several trials. The new work shows that the drink does not simply raise blood &lt;a href="/topic/sugar"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it appears to trigger small shifts in the body’s regulatory systems that reduce inflammation and help blood vessels relax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural compounds in oranges, particularly hesperidin, a citrus flavonoid known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, seem to influence processes related to high blood pressure, &lt;a href="/topic/cholesterol"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; balance and the way the body handles sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response also varies by body size. People carrying more weight tended to show greater changes in genes involved in fat metabolism, while leaner volunteers showed stronger effects on inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review of controlled trials involving 639 participants from 15 studies found that regular orange juice consumption lowered insulin resistance and blood cholesterol levels. Insulin resistance is a key feature of pre-diabetes, and high cholesterol is an established risk factor for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another analysis focusing on overweight and obese adults found small reductions in systolic blood pressure and increases in high density lipoprotein (HDL), often called the good cholesterol, after several weeks of daily orange juice consumption. Although these changes are modest, even slight improvements in blood pressure and cholesterol can make a meaningful difference when maintained over many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More clues come from studies that examine metabolites, the tiny molecules produced as the body processes food. A recent review found that orange juice influences pathways related to energy use, communication between cells and inflammation. It may also affect the gut microbiome, which is increasingly understood to play a role in heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1kgrxrh-0 cwsJCk"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-1kgrxrh-3 bjzyaY"&gt;About the author&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1kgrxrh-5 gKrfvr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;David C.

These compounds help maintain healthy blood pressure and reduce inflammation. Volunteers also showed improved blood sugar control and lower levels of inflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors that includes high blood pressure, raised blood sugar and excess body fat, may see particular benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one study, daily orange juice consumption improved the function of the lining of blood vessels, known as endothelial function, in 68 obese participants. Endothelial function describes how well blood vessels relax and widen, and better function is associated with a lower risk of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all studies report the same outcomes. A broader analysis of blood fat concentrations found that although levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL), often called the bad cholesterol, often fall, other lipid measurements such as triglycerides and HDL may not change much. Even so, people who regularly drink orange juice may still benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of 129 workers in an orange juice factory in Brazil reported lower blood concentrations of apolipoprotein B, or apo-B, a marker that reflects the number of cholesterol-carrying particles linked to heart attack risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the evidence challenges the idea that drinking citrus fruit juice is simply consuming sugar in a glass. Whole fruit remains the better choice because of its fibre, but a modest daily glass of pure orange juice appears to have effects that build up over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include easing inflammation, supporting healthier blood flow and improving several blood markers linked to long-term heart health. It is a reminder that everyday foods can have more influence on the body than we might expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 12:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxNZ05QcjJUOHpYM3RNdURVRWE1TjgxZ3Zmek14QzVramVxejFweXJHTlZ2OENWbWV4VUpPYW9DQ3h5R0MyZE1ZTDFZbk5zUzBQckxPcGZnelhSVWE5a3N4NkFYb2JDemlCZ3BrMTZSLS14SnJYYWFvcHlGOGZsM1VPQzE4a1BtYW5Lc3plWTlhMEJaZWZiRkJfc2hTa0M4QlAwQTRzS3drWU5nWERLQ3Jjb0JzN1MzaTBralZPbHVvTkl6UQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，当你的肺完全关闭时， “屁股呼吸”可能成为紧急备份- The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/11/scientists-say-butt-breathing-could-become-the-emergency-backup-when-your-lungs-completely-shut-down/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content dynamic-entry-content" itemprop="text"&gt;
			
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Japan are testing whether &lt;strong&gt;oxygen&lt;/strong&gt; can be delivered &lt;strong&gt;through the human intestine&lt;/strong&gt;. The method—tested in animal models and now undergoing early human safety trials—aims to create a backup oxygen supply when &lt;strong&gt;lungs fail or ventilators aren’t available&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The process, which involves &lt;strong&gt;introducing an oxygen-rich liquid into the rectum&lt;/strong&gt;, mimics a natural adaptation observed in certain fish and amphibians that can breathe through their guts in low-oxygen environments. But the idea is not just evolutionary trivia. If proven effective in humans, it could revolutionize &lt;strong&gt;emergency respiratory support&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly in field medicine, ambulance transfers, or resource-limited settings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Behind the research is &lt;strong&gt;Dr. &lt;em&gt;Takanori Takebe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a physician-scientist affiliated with &lt;strong&gt;Cincinnati Children’s Hospital&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;University of Osaka&lt;/strong&gt;, who was inspired to pursue the idea after his father was hospitalized with pneumonia and placed on a ventilator. “I was really shocked by how invasive it is,” Takebe told &lt;a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/butt-breathing-gut-oxygen-bloodstream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The experience sparked his search for a &lt;strong&gt;non-invasive oxygen therapy&lt;/strong&gt; that could supplement or temporarily replace lung function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How Rectal Oxygen Therapy Works in Mammals&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this experimental treatment is a substance called &lt;strong&gt;perfluorodecalin&lt;/strong&gt;—a liquid already used in medical imaging. It can carry high volumes of dissolved oxygen and is administered rectally using an enema-like device. Once in the &lt;strong&gt;lower gastrointestinal tract&lt;/strong&gt;, the oxygen in the fluid is absorbed through the intestinal wall and into the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/11/life-expectancy-in-this-u-s-state-is-four-years-lower-than-the-national-average-and-its-getting-worse/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="109886" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bloodstream&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In controlled experiments published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/med/fulltext/S2666-6340(21)00153-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Med (Cell Press)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, oxygen-infused perfluorodecalin helped &lt;strong&gt;mice and pigs survive hypoxic conditions&lt;/strong&gt;. In pigs, a &lt;strong&gt;400-milliliter dose&lt;/strong&gt; elevated oxygen levels for around 19 minutes. In follow-up trials reported in &lt;em&gt;Med&lt;/em&gt; in December 2023, oxygen delivery was extended up to 30 minutes using optimized dosing methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The moment I saw the blood samples change from muddy brown to bright red, that was my ‘aha’ moment,” Takebe recalled in the &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt; article—referring to the color change that indicated successful oxygen transfer to the blood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the method doesn’t match the efficiency of lung-based breathing, researchers believe it could provide &lt;strong&gt;short-term, non-invasive oxygenation&lt;/strong&gt;—particularly in acute settings where mechanical ventilation is delayed, dangerous, or unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Human Safety Trials Reveal Key Limits—And Early Promise&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To move from animal studies to human use, Takebe’s team began by testing the &lt;strong&gt;safety of perfluorodecalin enemas&lt;/strong&gt; in 27 healthy male volunteers in Japan. The fluid was not oxygenated, as the trial’s purpose was to evaluate tolerance—not efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doses ranged from &lt;strong&gt;25 milliliters to 1.5 liters&lt;/strong&gt;—the maximum volume already approved for contrast agents in gastrointestinal scans. According to the study, most participants tolerated up to &lt;strong&gt;1 liter&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;mild side effects&lt;/strong&gt; like bloating and &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/07/im-a-gastroenterologist-and-this-is-the-seasonal-vegetable-i-recommend-for-melting-fat/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="6987" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;abdominal discomfort&lt;/a&gt;. Four out of six participants in the&lt;strong&gt; 1.5-liter&lt;/strong&gt; group reported &lt;strong&gt;stomach pain&lt;/strong&gt; and discontinued the test early.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image.jpeg.webp" alt="Image" class="wp-image-110981" srcset="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image.jpeg.webp 1030w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-420x237.jpeg.webp 420w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-520x293.jpeg.webp 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physician Takanori Takebe. Courtesy of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The research is supported by &lt;strong&gt;EVA Therapeutics&lt;/strong&gt;, a start-up co-founded by Takebe to pursue development of &lt;strong&gt;oxygen-enriched rectal delivery systems&lt;/strong&gt;. While these early results don’t yet prove clinical benefit, they represent a necessary step toward testing whether &lt;strong&gt;intestinal oxygen therapy&lt;/strong&gt; could be used in emergency medical settings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Medical Community Is Intrigued, but Skeptical&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reactions among pulmonary specialists remain mixed. While some acknowledge the innovation, others are concerned about &lt;strong&gt;practical limitations&lt;/strong&gt;—especially the low efficiency of oxygen transfer compared to lung ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As reported in &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. &lt;em&gt;John Laffey&lt;/em&gt;, a critical care researcher at the &lt;strong&gt;University of Galway&lt;/strong&gt;, is unconvinced. “The lung, even an injured lung, will always exchange gas way better than any other organ, because that’s what it’s designed for.” Laffey also noted the challenge of oxygen volume: “A liter of perfluorodecalin carries 500 milliliters of oxygen. We use 250 milliliters per minute.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, keeping a patient alive with this method would require &lt;strong&gt;frequent enemas&lt;/strong&gt;, something neither practical nor scalable in most emergency settings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet not all experts are dismissive. &lt;em&gt;Dr. Kevin Gibbs&lt;/em&gt;, a pulmonary care physician at &lt;strong&gt;Wake Forest University School of Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;, sees value in specific, short-term scenarios. “What I find exciting is if this drug works… maybe you can administer this, and then all of the sudden they have this real boost in oxygen for the time it takes you to safely put someone on life support—and that would be huge,” he said in &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Redefining Emergency Oxygen Therapy in a Crisis-Prone World&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While rectal oxygenation may never replace standard mechanical ventilation, it could offer &lt;strong&gt;a crucial bridge in high-risk or low-resource situations&lt;/strong&gt;—from mass casualty events to natural disasters, or even battlefield medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The concept also aligns with a growing interest in &lt;strong&gt;non-invasive treatments for hypoxia&lt;/strong&gt;, especially in light of global ventilator shortages witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. In such emergencies, any technology that can extend a patient’s survival window—even by minutes—could radically change outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Takebe envisions the treatment as a &lt;strong&gt;supplement to conventional respiratory support&lt;/strong&gt;, not a replacement. “Maybe we can apply this in emergency situations, like hospital-to-hospital transfers or ambulance procedures,” he told &lt;em&gt;Science News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it's generally healthy to take these every day, don't overdo it. Long-term use and overuse of probiotics can cause &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/signs-of-small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-sibo-4125271" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)&lt;/a&gt;. This imbalance and overgrowth of certain microbes leads to some of the same symptoms you were originally experiencing, like bloating, gas, and discomfort.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When buying supplements, I always recommend picking a brand that has third-party testing from NSF or another independent testing group. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate supplements for safety and effectiveness before they hit store shelves, so without third-party testing, you may waste your money on low-quality probiotics.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keep in mind that some probiotics need refrigeration, so make sure you store them properly. Otherwise, you might accidentally kill the live bacteria.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Probiotics are measured in colony-forming units (CFU), and some products have billions of CFU. However, taking a huge amount of CFU is not necessarily safe or effective.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to the CFU, supplement packages typically say which strains are included. People often take too many different &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/tips-for-choosing-probiotic-supplements-8723178" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotic strains&lt;/a&gt;, but more is not always better. You can try to read some peer-reviewed studies on specific strains to help you make your decision. Unfortunately, there has not been a lot of research to show what each strain is good for. More research is coming, and we should all keep an eye out - overall, I'm a big fan of probiotics.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When starting probiotics, you may experience bloating, gas, or diarrhea. These side effects subside after your gut gets used to the probiotics. Talk to your healthcare provider if the symptoms don't go away, since that might signal something more serious.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As with anything, some people may also have an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/side-effects-of-probiotics-11797072" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;allergic reaction to probiotics&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can always try &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/probiotic-foods-7970825" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotic food sources&lt;/a&gt; instead of supplements. You're unlikely to get too much since your bodies know how to regulate probiotics from food. Try yogurt with live cultures, like Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, tempeh, miso, or kombucha.

Researchers at the University of Toronto think the pace of everyday speech may be a better indicator of cognitive decline than difficulty finding a word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results indicate that changes in general talking speed may reflect changes in the brain," &lt;a href="https://baycrestfoundation.org/articles/research/talking-faster-is-linked-to-better-brain-health/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; cognitive neuroscientist Jed Meltzer when the research was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that talking speed should be tested as part of standard cognitive assessments to help clinicians detect cognitive decline faster and help older adults support their brain health as they age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-early-speech-related-signs-youre-at-risk-of-alzheimers-disease?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;5 Early, Speech-Related Signs You're at Risk of Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lethologica, also known as the '&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_of_the_tongue"&gt;tip of the tongue&lt;/a&gt;' phenomenon, is experienced by young and old alike. But as we grow older, finding the name for things can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/jiag.jiag_32_21"&gt;become more challenging,&lt;/a&gt; especially over the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore why that is, researchers asked 125 healthy adults, between the ages of 18 and 90, to describe a scene in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the participants were shown pictures of everyday objects while listening to audio that was designed to confirm or confuse them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if participants were shown a picture of a broom, the audio might say 'groom', which helps them recall the word through rhyme. But on the flip side, the audio might also offer a related word like 'mop', which can lead the brain astray, momentarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The faster a person's natural speech in the first task, the more quickly they came up with answers in the second task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings align with the 'processing speed theory', which argues that a general slowdown in cognitive processing lies at the very center of cognitive decline, not a slowdown in memory centers specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is clear that older adults are significantly slower than younger adults in completing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-early-speech-related-signs-youre-at-risk-of-alzheimers-disease"&gt;various cognitive tasks&lt;/a&gt;, including word-production tasks such as picture naming, answering questions, or reading written words," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13825585.2024.2315774"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; a team led by University of Toronto psychologist Hsi T. Wei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In natural speech, older adults also tend to produce more dysfluencies such as unfilled and filled pauses (e.g., "uh" and "um") in between speech and have a generally slower speech rate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2024 &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/slowed-speech-may-indicate-cognitive-decline-more-accurately-than-forgetting-words-224812"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;i&gt;The Conversation&lt;/i&gt;, dementia researcher Claire Lancaster said that the study from Toronto "has opened exciting doors… showing that it's not just what we say but how fast we say it that can reveal cognitive changes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-signal-of-future-alzheimers-could-be-hidden-in-the-way-you-speak"&gt;Recently, some AI algorithms&lt;/a&gt; have used speech patterns to predict an Alzheimer's diagnosis with an accuracy of 78.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studies have found that patients with more signs of amyloid plaque in their brain are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.14283/jpad.2021.8"&gt;1.2 times more likely&lt;/a&gt; to show speech-related problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amyloid plaques are a hallmark of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-could-be-linked-to-a-common-virus-you-already-have"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, as are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sky-high-levels-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-newborns"&gt;tau tangles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, researchers at Stanford University &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.13731"&gt;led a study&lt;/a&gt; that found longer pauses and slower speech rates were associated with higher levels of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-study-reveals-how-toxic-clumps-warp-neurons-at-their-core"&gt;tangled tau proteins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging records of 237 cognitively unimpaired adults suggest those with greater tau burdens tended to have a slower speech rate, longer pauses between speech, and more pauses overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, participants with greater evidence of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer-drugs-show-alzheimers-promise-in-mice"&gt;tau in their brains&lt;/a&gt; did not have more difficulty producing the right answer in memory recall tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps participants dealing with early memory issues are still finding the right answer; they are just taking longer to get there, leading to slower speech with more pauses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that's true, then &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-the-part-of-the-brain-responsible-for-making-sure-words-sound-right"&gt;speech patterns&lt;/a&gt;

            Near the back corner of the local library’s parking lot, largely out of view from the main road, the South Carolina Department of Public Health opened a pop-up clinic in early November, offering free measles vaccines to adults and children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga36es00003b6q0q3zz96x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Spartanburg County, in South Carolina’s Upstate region, has been fighting a measles outbreak since early October, with more than 50 cases identified. Health officials have encouraged people who are unvaccinated to get a shot by visiting its mobile vaccine clinic at any of its several stops throughout the county.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3lag00063b6qoxtsjogv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But on a Monday afternoon in Boiling Springs, only one person showed up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3lag00073b6qy4l2my4u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s progress. That progress is slow,” Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist with the Department of Public Health, said during a recent press briefing. “We had hoped to see a more robust uptake than that in our mobile health units.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3lag00083b6qgd1j2wq3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As South Carolina tries to contain its measles outbreak, public health officials across the nation are concerned that the highly contagious virus is making a major comeback. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;more than 1,700 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; and 45 outbreaks in 2025. The largest started &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccines-rfk-trump/" target="_blank"&gt;in Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where hundreds of people were infected and two children died.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            For the first time in more than two decades, the United States is poised to lose its measles &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other-health/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/#:~:text=Measles%20has%20been%20officially%20%E2%80%9Celiminated,in%20any%20year%20since%201992." target="_blank"&gt;elimination status&lt;/a&gt;, a designation indicating that outbreaks are rare and rapidly contained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3lag000a3b6qlaa7utcv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            South Carolina’s measles outbreak isn’t yet as large as those in other states, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Outbreak-Data" target="_blank"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;. But it shows how a confluence of larger national trends — including historically low vaccination rates, skepticism fueled by the pandemic, misinformation, and “health freedom” ideologies proliferated by conservative politicians — have put some communities at risk for the reemergence of a preventable, potentially deadly virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3lag000b3b6qwtafrmxw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Everyone talks about it being the canary in the coal mine because it’s the most contagious infectious disease out there,” said Josh Michaud, associate director for global and public health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. “The logic is indisputable that we’re likely to see more outbreaks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader_elevate vossi-subheader_elevate--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmiga3vog000d3b6q2gr86dbd@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="schools-and-small-brush-fires" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Schools and ‘small brush fires’
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga3jso00043b6qckj4phgg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Spartanburg’s vaccination rate is among the lowest of South Carolina’s 46 counties. And that was true “even before covid,” said Chris Lombardozzi, a senior vice president with the Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000i3b6qbawnqgp9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nearly 6,000 children in Spartanburg County schools last year — 10% of the total enrollment — either received an exemption allowing them to forgo required vaccinations or did not meet vaccine requirements, according to data published by the state.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000j3b6qlzs1dz9s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lombardozzi said the county’s low vaccination rate is tied to misinformation not only published on social media but also spread by “a variety of nonmedical leaders over the years.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000k3b6q61dm2560@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The pandemic made things worse. Michaud said that fear and misinformation surrounding covid vaccines “threw gasoline on the fire of people’s vaccine skepticism.” In some cases, that skepticism transferred to childhood vaccines, which historically have been less controversial, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000l3b6qpzhz0kxd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This made communities like Spartanburg County with low vaccination rates more vulnerable. “Which is why we’re seeing constant, small brush fires of measles outbreaks,” Michaud said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000m3b6qhxyk6e7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Spartanburg, the overall percentage of students with required immunizations fell from 95.1% to 90% between the 2020-21 and 2024-25 academic years. Public health officials say a minimum of 95% is required to prevent significant spread of measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000n3b6qsruyqipi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children who attend public and private schools in South Carolina are required to show that they’ve received some vaccinations, including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, but religious exemptions are relatively easy to obtain. The exemption form must be notarized, but it does not require a doctor’s note or any disclosure about the family’s religious beliefs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000o3b6qqzud3coy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The number of students in South Carolina who have been granted religious exemptions has increased dramatically over the past decade. That’s particularly true in the Upstate region, where religious exemptions have increased sixfold from a decade ago. During the 2013-14 school year, 2,044 students in the Upstate were granted a religious exemption to the vaccine requirements, according to &lt;a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/features/your_health/religious-exemptions-for-school-vaccine-requirements-worry-public-health-experts-in-south-carolina/article_86dc5de0-926f-11e7-93ba-47e9fd2cff5f.html" target="_blank"&gt;data published by The Post and Courier&lt;/a&gt;. By fall 2024, that number had jumped to more than 13,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000p3b6qun5f5de4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some schools are more exposed than others. The beginning of the South Carolina outbreak was largely linked to one public charter school, Global Academy of South Carolina, where only 17% of the 605 students enrolled during the 2024-25 school year provided documentation showing they had received their required vaccinations, according to data published by the Department of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga47ea000q3b6q9193chwv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No one from Global Academy responded to interview requests.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga468r000g3b6q5pf52q9h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April, after visiting a Texas family whose daughter had died from measles, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote on social media that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” He made a similar statement during an interview on “Dr. Phil” later that month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41000x3b6q5pbnc7a4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But these endorsements stand at odds with other statements Kennedy has made that cast doubt on vaccine safety and have falsely linked vaccines with autism. The CDC, under his authority, now claims such links “&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-autism-baseless-new-guidance-website/" target="_blank"&gt;have been ignored by health authorities&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41000y3b6qq7ywua7e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What would I do if I could go back in time and I could avoid giving my children the vaccines that I gave them?” he said on a podcast in 2020. “I would do anything for that. I would pay anything to be able to do that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41000z3b6q527u4zv8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Throughout 2025, he has made other &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/" target="_blank"&gt;misleading or unsupported statements&lt;/a&gt;. During a congressional hearing in September, Kennedy defended his past claims that he was not anti-vaccine but affirmed his stated position that no vaccines are safe or effective.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100103b6q0pvgj7y9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, told KFF Health News that Kennedy is “pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability.” Hilliard said HHS is working with “state and local partners in South Carolina” and in other states to provide support during the measles outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100113b6qe8w7teoi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Meanwhile, Kennedy has frequently championed the idea of health freedom, or freedom of choice, regarding vaccines, a talking point that has taken root among Republicans.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100123b6q64jecj7o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That has had a “chilling effect all the way down through state and local lawmakers,” Michaud said, making some leaders hesitant to talk about the threat that the ongoing measles outbreaks poses or the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100133b6qttzl3ngu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, said the governor was not available to be interviewed for this article but referenced McMaster’s comment from October that measles “is a dangerous disease, but in terms of diseases, it’s not one that we should panic about.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100143b6qdiyzl3m6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On a separate occasion that month, the Republican governor said he does not support vaccine mandates. “We’re not going to have mandates,” he said, “and I think we are responding properly.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100153b6q3knudvc7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even though the South Carolina Department of Public Health has repeatedly encouraged measles vaccines, the push has been notably quieter than the agency’s covid vaccine outreach efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100163b6q0ka46bda@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2021, for example, the agency partnered with breweries throughout the state for a campaign called “Shot and a Chaser,” which rewarded people who got a covid vaccine with a free beer or soda. By contrast, the pop-up measles vaccine clinic at the Boiling Springs Library featured no flashy signage, no freebies, and wasn’t visible from the library’s main entrance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100173b6ql0oy4ya7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Edward Simmer, interim director of the Department of Public Health, would not speak to KFF Health News about the measles outbreak. During a legislative hearing in April, Republican state lawmakers voted against his permanent confirmation because of his past support for covid vaccines and masking. One lawmaker specifically criticized the agency during that hearing for the Shot and a Chaser campaign.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100183b6qrf88mi38@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Public health officials in other states also have been blocked from new roles because of their covid response. In Missouri, where &lt;a href="https://health.mo.gov/living/families/schoolhealth/dashboard.php" target="_blank"&gt;MMR vaccine rates have declined&lt;/a&gt; among kindergartners since 2020 and measles cases have been reported this year, Republican lawmakers &lt;a href="https://www.kcur.org/politics-elections-and-government/2022-02-01/missouri-senate-rejects-governors-pick-for-health-director-over-support-for-covid-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;rejected a public health director&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 after vaccine opponents protested his appointment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w4100193b6qeqfo9dcm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In South Carolina, Simmer, lacking lawmakers’ confirmation, leads the public health agency in an interim capacity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41001a3b6qhndyynvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            South Carolina Sen. Tom Davis of Beaufort was the only Republican on the Senate Medical Affairs Committee who voted to confirm Simmer in April. He told KFF Health News that his Republican colleagues raised valid questions about Simmer’s past support for covid vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41001b3b6qjen4zuuv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But, Davis said, it would be “tremendously unfortunate and not beneficial from a public health perspective” if the Republican Party just took a stance against vaccines “as a matter of policy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41001c3b6qpn1lp3r2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Department of Public Health had administered 44 doses of the MMR vaccine through its mobile health unit from October to mid-November. The last mobile vaccine clinic was scheduled for Nov. 24. But health officials are encouraged that patients are seeking vaccines elsewhere. The agency’s tracking system shows that providers across Spartanburg County administered more than twice as many measles vaccines in October as they did a year ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41001d3b6q9j0s60a2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As of mid-November, more than 130 people remained in quarantine, most of them students at local elementary and middle schools. Cases have also been linked to a church and Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41001e3b6quhnp6psb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re reminding people that travel for the upcoming holidays increases the risk of exposures greatly,” said Bell, the state epidemiologist. “Due to that risk, we’re encouraging people to consider getting vaccinated now.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiga4w41001f3b6qegm2z0ww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

Many of us identify with being at least a little clumsy, and generally, it’s something to laugh about. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sometimes, however, clumsiness can be a sign of a bigger issue than just needing a bandage or waiting for a bruise to heal. It can be indicative of a larger issue related to our brains. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There are a variety of medical problems that can lead to clumsiness, including general medical conditions, hormonal dysfunction, visual problems and neurological disorders,” said Dr. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/dr-alessandro-di-rocco-md-11378906" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Alessandro Di Rocco" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="691f8404e4b047290e295f75" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/dr-alessandro-di-rocco-md-11378906" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alessandro Di Rocco&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;span&gt; the director of neurology, Parkinson’s and movement disorders at Northwell Health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Among the more common neurological problems are ‘mini-strokes,’ due to occlusion of small blood vessels in the brain, neurodegenerative brain diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, which develop frequently in older individuals, or other neurological disorders, including accumulation of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), inflammation and peripheral nerve disease (neuropathy),” Di Rocco added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you panic and turn to &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; for more information (please don’t), we consulted doctors who specialize in brain health to find out the specific clumsiness-related signs you may need to see a doctor about for further evaluation. Here’s what they had to say:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. You’re having more frequent accidents or injuries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Neuropsychologist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/sanam-hafeez-forest-hills-ny/92740" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Sanam Hafeez" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="691f8404e4b047290e295f75" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/sanam-hafeez-forest-hills-ny/92740" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sanam Hafeez&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said&lt;span&gt; that, from a medical standpoint, it’s important to consider that a certain degree of clumsiness is typical. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The average person may have moments of clumsiness, which can include knocking over objects or spilling a drink, but it’s usually nothing to worry about,” Hafeez said, noting that sometimes clumsiness can be a side effect of anxiety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, a sign that your clumsiness isn’t normal is a sudden increase in accidents or injuries, she said. So if you notice you’re falling often or getting into minor accidents, it can be a good idea to see a doctor to get to the root of what’s going on. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Functions you normally have no issue with become difficult.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When functions we normally have no problem executing become difficult or impaired, clumsiness may be a sign of a larger medical problem, Di Rocco said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“For instance, even an individual who has never been too dexterous with manual tasks may start dropping objects, having difficulty typing or walking, or start falling more,” he explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Your clumsiness feels new and jarring.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a lot of us, a little bit of clumsiness is part of our daily lives. But it could be a sign that your clumsiness isn’t normal if you find yourself thinking, “Why can’t I keep my balance?” or “Why do I keep dropping my phone?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Normal clumsiness is something you have always had since childhood,” said Dr. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.orlandohealth.com/physician-finder/amparo-gutierrez-md-faan#/overview" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Amparo Gutierrez" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="691f8404e4b047290e295f75" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.orlandohealth.com/physician-finder/amparo-gutierrez-md-faan#/overview" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amparo Gutierrez&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;span&gt; a neurologist with the Orlando Health Neuroscience Institute. “New clumsiness that develops over hours or days is abnormal, and medical advice should be sought.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Di Rocco also underscored this. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Changes in dexterity or an awareness of becoming clumsy should prompt a medical evaluation, especially if the clumsiness is persistent and not occasional,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Charday Penn via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Charday Penn via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Increased injuries and accidents from clumsiness are signs that you should speak with your doctor.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased clumsiness isn’t always serious, but you should get checked out to be sure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While a sudden acceleration in clumsiness could be a sign of a serious health issue, there can also be other explanations with simpler fixes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“An increase in clumsiness could be attributed to deficiencies in vitamins or minerals like vitamin B12 or magnesium,” Hafeez said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s also possible that a new medication is causing clumsiness, in which case you can speak to your doctor about adjusting your dose or trying something else. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An increase in clumsiness can also be a normal part of the aging process, according to Di Rocco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What is normal function or clumsiness at age 30 is very different than at age 70,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, people tend to have more trouble with balance as they age and may fall more frequently, but that doesn’t necessarily mean there’s anything serious going on with their brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With all that in mind, if you’re worried about an uptick in clumsiness, it’s always a good idea to speak with a health professional. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you notice persistent clumsiness that interferes with your daily activities or seems to be worsening over time, it’s a good idea to see a doctor,” Hafeez said. “If clumsiness is accompanied by other symptoms such as a severe headache, weakness or numbness on one side of the body, difficulty speaking, confusion, vision changes, dizziness or loss of balance, see a doctor immediately.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clumsiness is a normal part of being human. But if it starts to interfere with your daily life or you notice an abrupt change in your motor skills, be sure to speak with a medical provider as soon as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 12:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>这1项活动非常适合您的大脑—而且非常简单- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/exercise-benefits-brain-health-study_l_692098afe4b0536e01acd3d6</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The maxim “movement is medicine” exists for a reason.

For a week, they checked in with researchers six times a day, or about every 3.5 hours. During these check-ins, participants reported their recent physical activity and completed short cognitive assessments that measured their cognitive-processing speed and so-called working memory, the brain’s short-term storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What makes this study interesting, though, is that participants didn’t just report structured fitness activities like cycling, jogging and tennis; they also tracked everyday movements like playing with their kids or going for walks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Physical activity was rated as light, moderate or vigorous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts found that all levels of physical activity, from doing chores to going for a brisk run, were good for brain function. While the study didn’t find that this was linked to more accurate working memory, those who engaged in physical activity in the hours before a check-in showed improvements in cognitive-processing speed equivalent to being four years younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, yes, there’s likely a reason why it can feel &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;harder to get work done after sitting at your desk for hours and hours with no break.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One limitation of this study is that participants self-reported their physical activity levels, which could leave room for error. The number of participants was also pretty small, but experts agree with the findings nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;span&gt;The study ... affirms the long-held understanding that exercise is beneficial for the brain, and it improves brain function,” &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/sayed-azizi/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. S.

For instance, high blood pressure increases not only your risk of heart attack, but your risk of dementia, too. The same goes for &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/abnormal-cholesterol-metabolism-linked-dementia-risk" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="high cholesterol" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692098afe4b0536e01acd3d6" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/abnormal-cholesterol-metabolism-linked-dementia-risk" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.

Beyond typical exercise, you should aim to get moving around the house as much as possible, too — just like the study participants who engaged in chores and similar activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of sitting at your desk for hours on end, get up to refill your water bottle, take your dog outside or simply walk up and down the stairs a few times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movement is just one way to keep your brain sharp (albeit a crucial one). Adequate sleep and exercising your brain — such as by challenging yourself with puzzles and learning new things — are also important, said Rogalski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of these things have positive impacts on our overall health ... as well as our cognitive health,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 12:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQUjNYRUNlVjI2Mkx4eElqZ3hRdWJvek1RaDVVN29aTktWaDR4czVNS0lhVEE3bVBrSDhiYVFVbm9TRTdRSkF6S1Y4LXNGMl9feHN4bmsyd1BZWEVFMy1zUW5COGNrUVFHTjh5T1V2QVZYa2pVekI3bGVneGxaSjVnMkxGVTdCb29hZTFlcVR1d3BNeE11Q3pCMmRn0gGfAUFVX3lxTE5CYUs0SnM3RFRyemI2ckhCUXVHSEJHX2Zhb1czX3ROSDFLTngtUUM4Ni0zdkhMQ3gxRzhpa1VLeFh1OGNrY0tUMGVTNE56ejFfcm9Ubl9RUk1UenFybFhRbnZSSm5UbUhVeDhjWFREVnZydVVld2VPWjdQeGprMGR5TURZamZ3UkVfZ0phYS1GXzNuX29IQWN4bTZwRUEyaw</guid></item><item><title>女性额头上有四英寸的蠕虫孵化器，蠕动到眼睑- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/doctors-pull-4-inch-worm-out-of-womans-eyelid-after-monthlong-incubation/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;Creeping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone enjoying—or at least trying to enjoy—Thanksgiving in America, you can be thankful that these worms are not present in the US; they are exclusive to the “Old World,” that is Europe, Africa, and Asia, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/dirofilariasis/index.html"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. They’re often found in the Mediterranean region, but reports in recent years have noted that they seem to be expanding into new areas of Europe—particularly eastward and northward. In a report earlier this year of &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1890_article"&gt;cases in Estonia&lt;/a&gt;, researchers noted that it is also emerging in Lithuania, Latvia, and Finland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers attribute the worm’s creep to climate change and globalization. But in another &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/13/3/476#B7-microorganisms-13-00476"&gt;report this year of a case in Austria&lt;/a&gt; (thought to be acquired while the patient was vacationing in Greece), researchers also raised the speculation that the worms may be adapting to use humans as a true host. Researchers in Serbia suggested this in &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/12/23-0796_article"&gt;a 2023 case report&lt;/a&gt;, in which an infection led to microfilariae in the patient’s blood. The researchers speculated that such cases, considered rare, could be increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, people in America have less to worry about. &lt;em&gt;D. repens&lt;/em&gt; has not been found in the US, but it does have some relatives here that occasionally show up in humans, including &lt;em&gt;D. immitis, &lt;/em&gt;the cause of dog heartworm, and &lt;em&gt;D. tenuis&lt;/em&gt;. The latter can cause similar cases to &lt;em&gt;D. repens&lt;/em&gt;, with worms wandering under the skin, particularly around the eye. So far, this worm has mainly been found in raccoons in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who do find a worm noodling through their skin, the outlook is generally good. Treatment includes surgical removal of the worm, which largely takes care of the problem, as well as anti-parasitic or antibiotic drugs to be sure to stamp out the infection or any co-infections.

Now imagine forgetting the sunscreen and by evening your skin is blistered, painful and peeling. That is what untreated diabetes can do to your feet over time, slowly and subtly until one day a tiny cut becomes a major problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For someone living with diabetes, feet are not just an ignored body part, they are the first alarm system for deeper health issues. Think of them as your frontline soldiers where small cuts can become ulcers, mild redness can signal nerve damage and untreated blisters can escalate to infections and, in severe cases, amputation. That is why doctors call foot care as vital as insulin and diet but prevention does not mean expensive treatments or hospital visits. Often, simple daily foot habits, smart footwear and gentle activity can keep your feet safe, healthy and intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Easy to do yoga asanas to reduce blood sugar levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with the Times of India, Dr Mahesh Babu, Senior Consultant Diabetologist at Meenakshi Super Speciality Hospital in Madurai, shared, “Foot hygiene and regular inspection is as vital as insulin and diet management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washing feet with lukewarm water helps. Moisturising helps but excessive moisturising can lead to fungal infections. Custom made diabetic footwear or using of insoles helps in distributing pressure equally and does not create friction as much as open slippers or high heels do, that creates blisters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each step of prevention is a step away from complications. Bringing his expertise to the same, Dr Nanda Kumar R, Senior Consultant - General Medicine at SRM Hospitals in Chennai, said, “Feet health is usually given the least attention despite being one of the first areas to show serious damage. High blood sugar damages small nerves, leading to loss of sensation and poor circulation — making tiny blisters progress into ulcers that can require hospitalisation or amputation. In India, 25% of diabetes-related hospital admissions are due to foot complications. Foot ulcers have a five-year mortality rate of 40–45%, comparable to several cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the research says&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic footwear cuts ulcer risk by nearly half. Dr Mahesh Babu emphasised on custom-made footwear to reduce pressure and prevent blisters and ulcers. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36204487/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2022 study in Journal of Foot and Ankle Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, revealed, “Special therapeutic footwear with offloading properties significantly reduces the incidence of diabetic foot ulcers compared to conventional footwear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Custom insoles lower plantar pressure, which is a major cause of ulcers. Dr Mahesh Babu revealed that proper insoles prevent friction and pressure, unlike open sandals or heels. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/60/12/2066" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2024 study in Medicina (MDPI)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found, “The use of foot insoles significantly reduced peak plantar pressure in the hallux, medial and lateral forefoot areas compared to controls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Footwear only works if you actually wear it. Dr Nanda Kumar warned that complications escalate fast if preventive steps (like proper shoes) are ignored. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3836114/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2013 Diabetes Care study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found, “Among patients with high adherence, custom-made footwear reduced ulcer recurrence risk by 46% versus standard footwear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes diabetic foot damage?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Nanda Kumar explained that prolonged high blood sugar damages the tiny nerves of the feet, a condition called peripheral neuropathy. This leads to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of sensation (you don’t feel cuts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor circulation (wounds heal slowly)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Altered skin texture (dry, cracked, flaky)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High pressure points (which turn into ulcers)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined with wrong footwear or lack of inspection, these small issues turn into major medical emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preventive steps: Expert-approved&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foot Hygiene and Inspection “As Vital as Insulin”: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Wash feet in lukewarm water, dry between toes and inspect every day for cracks, redness, swelling, colour changes and tiny wounds. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moisturise But Know Where to Stop: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Use lotion on the heels and sole, not between toes. Excess moisture leads to fungal infections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wear Custom-Made Footwear or Insoles: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Dr Babu emphasised, “They distribute pressure equally and prevent friction.” Open slippers, thin sandals and high heels cause blisters, calluses and pressure wounds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose the Right Activity: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Dr Babu recommended Yoga, mild walking and stretching. Avoid running, long hikes and high-impact sports because Neuropathy means you may not feel when shoes are injuring you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevate the Feet Daily: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Helps improve blood flow and reduce swelling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know the Red Flags and Seek Immediate Care: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Dr Mahesh Babu highlighted that skin turning black, oozing wounds, persistent ulcers, foul odour or discharge may signal infection or tissue death. Dr Nanda Kumar pointed out consistent numbness in feet or tingling, flaky skin on feet, small wounds or cuts tend to heal slower than usual, healing slows down during constant swelling or redness on feet and changes in feet texture and skin colour as early warning signs that individuals must look out for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bottom line&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy feet are equivalent to independence. Foot complications are often the first and loudest warning sign of serious diabetes progression. The science is clear, the experts agree and the message is simple: check your feet, protect and prioritise them because when you live with diabetes, every step is not just movement, it is medicine. If you have diabetes, or know someone who does, take a moment today. Look at your feet. Check the soles. Feel for calluses. Notice dryness, cracks, redness. Are your shoes fitting well? Are they supportive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevention does not require amputation-level fear. It requires daily mindfulness, good habits and respectful care. Washing, moisturising sensibly, wearing proper insoles or therapeutic footwear, gentle walking, regular inspections and prompt medical attention may sound small but combined, these habits form a shield. Feet are the foundation of movement. In diabetes, that foundation is fragile. Protect it because every step you preserve is a step of independence, comfort and long-term health. Let that guide every step you take carefully, kindly and consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

What is the meaning of all this, what is life? Why am I here, given that I haven’t signed a consent form to be alive here and now, so what’s this all about, really?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I too was tortured by these deep questions as a young student in philosophy, and used to ponder them standing in front of a cast of Rodin’s statue in the grounds of the Hôtel Biron in Paris. I guess I was looking for something, the meaning of all this. Since then, and after drinking so much coffee that I could flood a city with it, I still haven’t got an answer. And yet, one day, something happened: a breakthrough, or perhaps an epiphany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I went back to &lt;em&gt;The Thinker&lt;/em&gt; as I had so many times when younger: he was still there, still thinking, holding his head as if all those deep, heavy thoughts had transformed his skull to stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While searching for the right angle to take a selfie, a miracle happened: I got hungry. Partly because of the heat, partly because I’d had just one black coffee in the morning, the head of Rodin’s &lt;em&gt;Thinker&lt;/em&gt; started tilting and melting, and the massive weight of his &lt;em&gt;body&lt;/em&gt; became visible to my mind. It was as if the statue was slowly liquefying and transforming into a vegetal living thing, something like a salad, or perhaps a cucumber? Something fresh anyway, something that I could have eaten on the spot. And then some questions popped into my head: did the Thinker like cucumber salad? Where did he grow up? Did he prefer summer or winter? White wine or red? Where was he from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in that moment I realised I had got it all wrong. I was so obsessed with his thinking brain that I had ignored his toes – not to mention the rest &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;of him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;rains are highly fashionable. A very common belief is that the human mind and cognition lie in the head, within the confines of a spongy greyish organ called ‘the brain’ encased within skull and skin. While I was looking at that &lt;em&gt;Thinker&lt;/em&gt;’s head, with my stomach protesting, I realised I had completely dismissed his body. I was obsessed with understanding his mind, and my mind via his brain, but I completely ignored the rest of him. Like the great majority of scientists and philosophers throughout history, I too was putting cognition into the head and forgetting about the body, treating it as something that got in the way of pure cerebral thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a philosopher hadn’t been my only dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Why are we so reluctant to consider the brain as just another part of the body?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d decided to study philosophy after becoming a frustrated musician. My parents, God bless them, considered that singing opera and playing piano were cool ways to impress the visitors, but wouldn’t lead to a career. Now they regret their decision not to allow me to take a musical path. When visitors politely ask what their daughter is doing for a living and they reply: ‘She’s a philosopher,’ the visitors look puzzled as if needing an extra explanation: ‘Yes, but what exactly is she &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;?’ My parents can’t say ‘she’s &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;’ because that would make them look silly, and they are extremely proud and reasonable folks. Now, if I were a musician, well, that would have been way simpler. Everyone gets what &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;musicians do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt a modern fascination with the thinking brain as the fundamental basis of human cognition. But why? Is this the only entrance point that allows us to understand who we are and what human cognition is? Here I propose another angle. While neurons are indeed fascinating, their complex activity is only part of the story of human cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, brains are part of the body, and bodies are made of cells and many other constituents, some of which are not literally &lt;em&gt;ours&lt;/em&gt;, like our unique DNA is. There are many ‘Brain and Body’ research institutes around the world, but no ‘Liver and Body’ institutes. Why is that? It’s because we think the liver is (part) of the body. But why are we so reluctant to consider the brain as just another part of the body? There’s no evidence that the brain is made of a different kind of ‘physical stuff’ from the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose a shift in focus from neural to cellular processing to highlight the fundamental role of cells in constituting biological self-organising systems such as the human body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he journey of understanding who we are, scientifically and philosophically, starts traditionally with a thinking guy – yes, it’s usually a guy, a solitary male genius – sorting out the mystery of the Universe from within his ivory tower. Yet, the journey of who we are as living beings starts way before, when a couple of cells start negotiating energetic resources with some other bunch of cells in the depths of a womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a philosopher/frustrated musician/cognitive neuroscientist, I now give academic talks all over the world, and one of my favourite things to do is to say the following line while carefully scanning the audience for their reactions: ‘You have all spent time growing inside another person’s body.’ Most of the time, people’s eyes widen as if some big mystery has just been revealed to them. Some nod their heads, others seem perplexed or in denial. But surely these smart academics know that babies don’t just drop from the sky or pop out from cabbages? As adults, we all know that we have been babies ourselves, and that we have all developed inside another person’s body. Why is this biological and scientific fact so difficult to recognise for our intelligentsia? Why are we so obsessed with minds, with pure self-conscious minds, while forgetting about bodies, and specifically about the other body that carried and fed our own one? Just think about it: long before being these lovely adults with hopes and dreams and failures, drinking coffee, paying taxes, and reading fancy books and articles online, each of us spent some time as a &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;single cell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more mind-blowing: all human beings gradually develop from cells to a human body &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; another human body. Pregnancy is a universal human fact that concerns everyone, not just a few of us. All cells of the human organism originate from a single cell, the zygote, are closely interconnected, mutually influence one another, and operate in synchrony to achieve common goals – maintenance of homeostasis and constant adaptation to changes of the surrounding environment. This means that we arrive into this world not on a solitary rock dropped by some mastermind, but as living biological creatures deeply dependent upon and connected with another living body. And then we need others to take care of us for quite some time before we can find a rock to sit on and think about deep things like the meaning of life or quantum physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;For that Thinker to contemplate the meaning of life, he has to self-regulate his humble internal bodily states&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand minds, we need to grasp first how we &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; minds. We need to start with the cells that compose our humble toes before zooming into the mystery of the brain. Why? Because our cells solve the biggest and most urgent problem of this great and mysterious adventure called life without a brain, and before we had a brain: how to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are living creatures. Living creatures are self-organising biological systems whose bodies constantly perform the humble yet essential, basic task of keeping track of &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt;-related information-processing to secure survival. In short, this means that your body works for you even when &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/two-billion-humans-are-doing-something-bizarre-right-now-sleeping" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;you are asleep&lt;/a&gt; or under anaesthesia: your heart keeps beating for you, not for someone else. This also means that all bodily processes have &lt;em&gt;the self&lt;/em&gt; at their very core, simply because they obey the universal drive governing all living systems which is: &lt;em&gt;don’t die!&lt;/em&gt; Self-preservation is fundamental. But because our body is a living system governed by the basic law of self-preservation, this means that all our experiences are necessarily embodied &lt;em&gt;self-&lt;/em&gt;experiences. In perceiving and experiencing the world, we ‘smuggle in’ our own fundamental self-survival goals. This is something we share with cats and worms and viruses. Whether this is also something we share with artificial systems is another story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bodily experiences are thus necessarily connected to biological self-regulation (or homeostasis) and self-preservation. For example, a penguin can survive in very cold temperatures, while humans can’t. Every organism has a set of optimal states it has to maintain in order to stay alive. If you are too cold, or too hot, or you need to go to the loo, or you are hungry and dream of salads, then you can’t think properly and solve complex abstract problems. For that Thinker to be able to contemplate the meaning of life on a rock, first he has to successfully self-regulate his humble internal bodily states. In short, the body is life – it is the &lt;em&gt;sine qua non&lt;/em&gt; of human existence. If one is alive, one is experiencing through one’s body, even when asleep, even under anaesthesia. And this very simple idea is crucial for redefining how we understand cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;et’s forget for a moment the Thinker, static and isolated on his pedestal, and go back to the growing or developing thinker. How did she get there in the first place? What is this thinker made of? Is she hungry or upset? All these questions may seem silly or irrelevant for the noble question ‘What is cognition?’ but here I suggest that, actually, it’s quite the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how the neurons work and how we get from neurons to minds, we first need to get back to square one, to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S105381002100043X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;understand&lt;/a&gt; how we get from cells to selves.&lt;/p&gt;

Photo by Jean de Calan, © and courtesy &lt;a href="https://collections.musee-rodin.fr/page/dessins/66615bc8b358e62d33dee7bd?v=mosaic&amp;amp;s=domaine&amp;amp;so=desc&amp;amp;pgn=39" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Musée Rodin, Paris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence from neurobiology and biochemistry suggests that cognitive categories such as ‘sensing’, ‘memory’ and ‘learning’ can be applied non-metaphorically to the behaviour of simple organisms such as bacteria. Previous work on ‘basal cognition’ questioned the prevailing idea that only brains (ie, collectives of neuronal cells) have the ability to ‘cognise’ or ‘learn’. Rather, non-neural cells and simple organisms may also be &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02688/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;perceived&lt;/a&gt; as active, primitive ‘cognisers’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thousands of cells must cooperate toward the production of one ‘embryo’ – achieving specific goals in their navigation of anatomical morphospace. But if the blastocyst is cut into pieces, each fragment self-organises its own embryo, resulting in monozygotic twins, triplets and so forth (which may or may not be conjoined). Thus, each cell is some other cell’s ‘external’ neighbour, and the collective must dynamically decide where the embryo ends and the outside world begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;How do you keep track of &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; when &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; don’t have a &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;brain yet?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, a dynamic and complex self-organising system such as the human body needs to be able to play a double poker game, so to speak, to survive and potentially reproduce. First, it must successfully maintain sensory states within certain physiologically viable bounds. Second, it must flexibly change these states to adapt to a volatile world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, suppose you are a cell within a self-organising biological system called the human body and you are obsessed with survival, like all sensible living creatures are. You don’t have a brain yet, no neurons at your disposal, but you still need to survive somehow. What do you do? How do you keep track of &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; when &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; don’t have a brain yet? It’s a major puzzle that Nature had to solve via billions of years of trials and errors. And she &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;did! How?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this, we need to answer the following question: which is the basic system at the organismic level that tells your cells which one is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; cell, and which one is not? The world is full of signals, and disturbing noise. You have to have some sort of filter that allows you to focus on what is vital for you and to dismiss or fight back against what is not good for you. That’s the job of the immune system. For adaptive biological self-organising systems such as the human body, immune cells develop before neurons, in order to take care and keep track of one’s self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new theory I propose here considers all bodily cells and their complex interconnections as being fundamental for cognition, not just neurons. Among our cells, the immune system plays a very special role, working in tandem with the neural system to help us build the ‘self’. The brain is usually considered &lt;a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/the-brain-has-a-team-of-conductors-orchestrating-consciousness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the conductor&lt;/a&gt; of the orchestra playing the concertos of your mind. I disagree. Nature invented a maestro way more discrete, less showy and dazzling perhaps than the brain and its sparkling connections, but older and very efficient!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he metabolic self-regulation and the immune system are fundamental components of organismic self-organisation in humans. It comprises a cellular network capable of distinguishing between self, non-self, missing self, and aberrant self, including misplaced cells and aberrant intracellular and extracellular molecules. In addition, the immune system also regulates the nervous system, behaviour, metabolism and thermogenesis, and takes part in the fight-or-flight response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neuroimmune tandem acts as key ‘fact-checker’ for all incoming information relevant for self-survival. From the body’s perspective, there is no such thing as perceptual time off or ‘blackout’ (except when one is dead). The body needs to keep track of one’s ‘self’ information all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being fundamentally a bodily system, the brain needs to carefully orchestrate and align its neural processing with a complex network of other types of cellular processing, particularly the immune system, to ensure the organism’s survival and to allow it to continue to have viable interactions with the world. Importantly, this idea was already present in the pioneering &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1878127/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;thinking&lt;/a&gt; of Francisco Varela and colleagues who spent quite some time working on the immune system in relation to cognitive systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well before neurons get off the ground, your immune system needs to be clever enough to tell which cell is ‘self’ and which one is not. If, for some reason, your immune cells get tricked and let a virus in, say, then that may be the end of our Thinker, and no contemplation of the meaning of life on a rock will be possible afterwards. Life happens way before, at the bodily, cellular level, without our explicit awareness. And life happens to us without our permission, so to speak. None of us chose to be alive. It simply happens to us. It happened to my cat, &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;Simon too!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;One can experience without thinking, but one cannot think without experiencing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we begin examining and introspecting the human mind and its mysteries systematically, as a scientific and philosophical endeavour, inevitably we are adults and hence we question the world from &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; adult perspective. In doing so, however, we may blindly use an adult-biased lens, which prevents us from capturing fundamental aspects of our minds. This observation seems trivial at first sight, yet &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;it is not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans do not pop out like Athena from Zeus’ head, or like the Thinker from Rodin’s hands. Rather, we are gestated, born, developing, decaying, and eventually dying. In real life, only at very rare occasions can one afford to stop and think like Rodin’s character, solitary and isolated on a rock. In real life, one needs to move, to interact, to change, to fall, to get up and fall again. Most of the time, we need to think on the fly while acting and interacting with the world and others. Also, we are rarely alone, and we are never just abstract minds, we are deeply embodied creatures, driven by hunger and longing to connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, is this piece about how eating salads and connecting with your mother is more important than thinking? In a way, yes. You can exist without thinking, but you can’t exist (for very long) without eating or connecting with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it bluntly: one can experience without thinking, but one cannot think without experiencing. Experiences come to the surface of being through the body, and not through the minds, or some sort of homunculus sitting in our heads, trying to ‘make sense’ of a world he doesn’t see, because the world is hidden in the black box of the scalp. We don’t perceive the world through some sort of inner solitary lens situated in our heads. We perceive the world through every single cell of our body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because human bodies first develop within another human body, at the beginning of our life, we perceive the world literally through another body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;This is what thinking is for: dealing with the messy jungle of life rather than the clean space of chess-playing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pregnancy, (at least) two immune systems need to &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-pregnancy-is-a-biological-war-between-mother-and-baby" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;negotiate the exchange&lt;/a&gt; of resources and information in order to maintain viable self-regulation of nested systems. The relationship, and the interactions between the &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; self-organising systems during pregnancy may play a pivotal role in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tops.12717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;understanding&lt;/a&gt; the nature of biological self-organisation per se in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it was traditionally assumed that the placenta and the fetus are non-active immunological organs – largely depending on the maternal immune system – recent work suggests a more complex picture. The placenta and the fetus represent an ‘additional immunological organ which affects the global response of the mother to microbial infections,’ as the physiology researchers Gil Mor and Ingrid Cardenas &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20367629/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;. The type of response initiated in the placenta may determine the immunological response of the mother, impacting the pregnancy outcome. The placenta represents an active immunological organ, highly responsive to foreign pathogens. For example, it has been shown that the placenta functions as a regulator of, rather than a barrier to, the trafficking between the fetus and the mother. Both the fetus and the placenta present an active immune system that has a direct effect on the way the mother responds to the environment. Importantly for our discussion here, the placental-immune system creates a pregnancy-friendly protective environment while still being fully operational and able to defend the mother and fetus against infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is always a collective decision and a collective endeavour. If this is so, then why are we focusing on solitary brains and high-level cognitive abilities such as chess-playing to understand cognition? The radical claim here is that a creature with neurons only cannot develop, act and survive in the wild. And, ultimately, this is what thinking is for: successfully dealing with the messy and unpredictable jungle of life rather than with the clean and predictable space of chess-playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;erhaps all those modern obsessions about thinking and neural models of cognition were built to raise high the ceiling of our pure minds protecting us from the impure, messy and constantly dying and birthing cells of our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if we are experiencing and cognising the world with every single cell in our entire body, not just the maestro brain? All our humble bodily cells participate in the making of our experiences and cognitive processes, and not just the ‘noble’ neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this really mean that we need our whole body to think? Surely I can cut off my toe, say, and still think? So what exactly is meant by saying that cognition is not in &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the brain&lt;/a&gt; and that I need the whole body? However, the really important question is: was your body ‘dumb’ before you had a brain? If so, how did you manage to survive without neurons? Who did the smart heavy lifting of information-processing for survival, to allow brains to grow properly in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, that famous Rodin sculpture was supposed to represent not a philosopher, but a poet – &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-fractal-consciousness-of-dantes-divine-comedy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dante, the author&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;The Divine Comedy&lt;/em&gt;. The artist represented the poet sitting at the door of the Inferno and other worlds, contemplating &lt;em&gt;the space in between&lt;/em&gt;, the border, the passage between life and death. Perhaps what Rodin was trying to show us was that the meaning of all this lies not hidden inside one’s head, but in what lies &lt;em&gt;in between &lt;/em&gt;us, the world, and others. And here I say that this fascinating ‘in between’, for which we don’t have a word in our Western societies yet, starts already in the womb, with the placenta, the mysterious messy bridge that brings life to life through another’s living body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 11:04:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQQVl1aks5MG0zR05WVF9zVnBEZDN1U1BCR1BTN29JQW55S3JXNmZENS1zRlctWkNZM3VmdzZRWHZrRUk2bTRGekhXUDk2UmxGS3MzT19JRjBoVlVNbEM2QzloaHJCTWRsX1ozRW1JZ2dQZmZzN0ZOZ0NVSi0tQWFQc19SS1Q</guid></item><item><title>面部移植带来了希望。患者被置于不可思议的境地--《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/27/face-transplant-patients-results-outcomes</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n the early hours of 28 May 2005, Isabelle Dinoire woke up in a pool of blood. After fighting with her family the night before, she turned to alcohol and sleeping tablets “to forget”, she later said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Reaching for a cigarette out of habit, she realized she couldn’t hold it between her lips. She understood something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Isabelle crawled to the bedroom mirror. In shock, she stared at her reflection: her nose, lips, and parts of her cheeks were gone, replaced by a raw, mangled wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While Isabelle was unconscious, her beloved dog Tania, a cross between a Labrador and a Beauceron, had chewed away her features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I could see a pool of blood next to me,” Isabelle &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20493572" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the BBC. “And the dog was licking the blood. But I couldn’t imagine that it was my blood or my face.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On 27 November 2005, Isabelle received the world’s first face transplant at University Hospital, CHU Amiens-Picardie, in northern France. The surgery was part of an emerging field called &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/vascularized-composite-allotransplantation" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;vascularized composite allotransplantation&lt;/a&gt; (VCA), that transplants parts of the body as a unit: skin, muscle, bone and nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Two teams, overseen by Bernard Devauchelle, Sylvie Testelin and Jean-Michel Dubernard, grafted a donor’s nose, lips and chin onto Isabelle’s skull. The donor, a 46-year-old woman, had died by suicide. The donor graft was painstakingly attached: sensory nerves to restore feeling, motor nerve fibres for movement, arteries and veins to establish blood flow. The operation involved 50 people and took more than 15 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The results were &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/06/france" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; to the press the following February, when Isabelle amazed the world by speaking through her new mouth and drinking water from a cup. “I now have a face like everyone else,” she said. “A door to the future is opening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The case for face transplants seemingly made, several teams scrambled to perform their nation’s first. The US saw the first partial face transplant (2008), then the first full one (2011); the first African American recipient (2019); the first face and double hand transplant combined (2020); the first to include an eye (2023). There have been about 50 face transplants to date, and each milestone brought new grants, donations and prestige for the doctors and institutions involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The patients, meanwhile, continue on living as they can. Some of them, like Isabelle, have suffered greatly. Others, like Joe DiMeo, who received the world’s first double hand and face transplant at NYU Langone in 2020, find new ways to forge a career by selling their stories online. But he and his wife Jessica, a nurse, are constantly trolled, and the spectre of rejection never leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="eb3ed1f3-d06c-41e2-9fa6-a6fd0a6f9195" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Jessica and Joe DiMeo (the first double hand and face transplant recipient).&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: April Kirby&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For the past six years, I have been researching the history of face transplants, interviewing surgeons and patients in the US, France, China, Spain, Italy, Mexico and Canada. I have contributed to surgical articles and conferences, brought patient voices to the table, and advised on a critical Department of Defense-funded study to regulate all kinds of VCA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What I’ve found is alarming: it’s a field where negative data is often buried, driven by funding battles and institutional rivalry. In places where publicity functions as marketing, some clinics expose patients to intrusive media attention. Support networks are uneven, and few patients are prepared for the toll of lifelong immunosuppressants. Add to this picture a set of ethical challenges: face transplants take otherwise healthy people with disfigured faces and turn them into lifetime patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People tend to remember a dramatic “&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30684-X/abstract" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;before and after&lt;/a&gt;”. The reality is different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/22/full-face-transplant-recdovering-us" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Dallas Wiens&lt;/a&gt; thought he’d won the medical lottery when he became America’s first full face transplant recipient in 2011. The 25-year-old electrician was electrocuted while painting a church; this destroyed his face and his sight. Dallas worried that his daughter Scarlette would be bullied for how he looked. He wanted to give “something back” to veterans. He wanted to be able to hail a cab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Like Isabelle, Dallas was grateful to his donor and surgeons. He attended medical conferences so surgeons could see the results. He met prospective patients and was courted by global media as proof that face transplants worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For several years, the narrative held; then reality intruded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The anti-rejection drugs that kept his new face alive destroyed his kidneys. Dallas had repeated episodes of rejection, each requiring stronger immunosuppression. He lived in Texas, in poverty, with his beloved wife Annalyn, who was also blind. Dallas’ primary medication alone cost $120 per month, a significant expense on disability benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s one thing to be told about risks,” Dallas told me when his kidneys were failing. “It’s another thing to experience them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the US, now the world’s leader in face transplants, the Department of Defense has bankrolled most operations, treating them as a frontier for wounded veterans while private insurers refuse to cover the costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;With insurance unwilling to pay until the field proves its worth, surgeons have been eager to show results. A 2024 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2823888" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;JAMA Surgery study&lt;/a&gt; reported five-year graft survival of 85% and 10-year survival of 74%, concluding that these outcomes make face transplantation “an effective reconstructive option for patients with severe facial defects”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet patients like Dallas tell a different story. The study measures survival, but not other outcomes such as psychological wellbeing, impact on intimacy, social life and family functioning, or even comparisons with reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most surgeons care about their patients, though they will have their own personal ambitions. Globally, there are perhaps 20 (mostly male) specialized surgeons capable of face transplants; nobody could become part of that elite group without ambition, for themselves, and for the field. And what can they do, surgeons say, if the system doesn’t provide?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s a double-bind. Without proof of success, face transplants are experimental. And because the procedures are experimental, patients’ long-term needs aren’t covered by grants, leaving patients to carry the burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="bfa05f11-32b1-4ec3-9f53-7f5ae084a8f3" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Dallas and Annalyn Wiens. Dallas died in 2024 of kidney failure.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: April Kirby&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I don’t have $100 for Ubers to and from hospital,” Dallas said, explaining how public transport led to infections, given his weakened immune system, and infections could make his face reject. “But if I don’t attend, it can be seen as non-compliance. Is that fair?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On 27 September 2024, Dallas died suddenly at his home in Fort Worth. His death certificate lists complications due to electrocution, his original 2008 accident. His wife Annalyn still doesn’t know what happened. “His body gave up,” she said. “He was constantly tested and made to feel like a guinea pig. I wanted his body to be left alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Annalyn had Dallas’ body cremated quickly, fearful that the DoD or Yale would want it for research. Neither did, but it says something about the gap between surgical intentions and patient experiences that this was her fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That fear was also expressed privately to me by a member of Isabelle’s immediate family, who wants to remain anonymous. From their perspective, Isabelle’s face transplant was not a success, despite launching an entire field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In fact, nobody expected France to do the first face transplant. Those in the know presumed it would be Cleveland Clinic, where Maria Siemionow had spent years refining the method and the ethics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In contrast, Devauchelle’s first application for ethical approval was rejected. In the early 2000s, French ethicists were, like those in the UK, concerned about immunosuppressant risks – and psychological ones. How could anyone cope with seeing another person’s face in the mirror?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For his next, successful bid, Devauchelle teamed up with Dubernard, who was not only an influential member of the French National Assembly, but also the surgeon who had made history in 1998 with the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/hand-transplant-declared-successful" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;world’s first hand transplant&lt;/a&gt;. And making history has always brought glory, especially for transplant surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What of Isabelle? Three months before her operation, she signed a contract with British documentary maker Michael Hughes, agreeing to let cameras document her transformation in exchange for payment. The Times of London &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/travel/destinations/europe-travel/france/paris/face-transplant-woman-to-profit-from-picture-sales-wkjkl5g3qgx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; this deal, showing how a vulnerable, suicidal woman with no face had been effectively “sold” even before surgery. Isabelle was swayed by the promise of a bright future, though that never transpired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Describing how he watched the blood flow into Isabelle’s lips in surgery, Dubernard compared himself to the prince who awakened Sleeping Beauty, adding: “I still see her image among the stars in my dreams”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Isabelle felt less like a princess than a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20493572" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;circus animal.&lt;/a&gt; After the transplant, she spoke of being tormented: “Everyone would say: Have you seen her? It’s her. It’s her … And so I stopped going out completely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Living with a stranger’s face was as psychologically difficult as ethicists feared. Two years after the transplant she &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/woman-who-received-worlds-first-partial-face-transplant-dies-isabelle-dinoire" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;spoke&lt;/a&gt; to the strangeness of having “someone else’s” mouth. “It was odd to touch it with my tongue. It was soft. It was horrible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And then one day she found a new hair on her chin – “It was odd. I’d never had one. I thought, ‘It’s me that has given it life, but the hair is hers.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Surgeons and ethicists observed that Isabelle wasn’t given proper alternatives, and she wasn’t in a good state of mind; the most the French team has conceded is that she wasn’t an “ideal patient”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Isabelle might have fared better in a country like Finland, where transplants are anonymous. Patients and families are not harassed by journalists – as Isabelle and her family were – and clinics don’t use patients as media opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, Isabelle never resumed a normal life, never returned to work or good mental health, and from 2013 experienced regular episodes of rejection. In 2010 she contracted cervical cancer, followed by lung cancer. She died in 2016, though her surgeons deny this was connected to immunosuppressant use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In fact, Isabelle’s face died before she did; after it became necrotic, it was removed and replaced with a graft from her thigh. As she told her family, she “didn’t want to die without a face”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I also learned from Isabelle’s immediate family member that her wellbeing declined dramatically after her transplant, and that she was in “psychological distress” when consenting for the procedure. “They took her away from us, so we didn’t have the power to dissuade or counsel her.” And after each psychiatric appointment, she would come home “at the lowest, full of guilt and suicidal desires”. More than once, according to her, she attempted suicide after her transplant; this story isn’t part of the record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Robert Chelsea, the first African American to receive a new face, wanted to kiss his daughter’s cheek. Now he can, but his daughter can’t look at him the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Only when he opens his mouth, I know it’s him”, she says, otherwise he’s a stranger. Today, Robert is in and out of hospital and unable to find income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Robert knows race makes a difference – the sinister history of medical &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/history/40-years-human-experimentation-america-tuskegee-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;experimentation on Black bodies&lt;/a&gt; means African Americans are less likely to donate organs of any kind. And scientific medicine privileges whiteness; until Robert’s surgery, the hospital hadn’t considered that donors with a wide range of skin colours were needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="947840ba-6032-4a7f-b656-4ba5d90b5629" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Robert Chelsea, the first African American face transplant recipient.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Lol Crawley&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Once a successful businessman, Robert is now reliant on GoFundMe campaigns; his car has been repossessed, and he can’t get to church. He suffers through rejections and infections, and he cannot afford caregivers. Sometimes, he gets so weak he can’t even call an ambulance. And if he did, that would be an extra cost he can’t afford either. Aftercare is the biggest issue for US face transplant recipients. Yet the JAMA study only measured outcomes by graft survival; not whether patients could work, afford medications, maintain relationships. It did not track financial ruin, mental health or quality of life. It counted 10 deaths but not how people died or what their final years were like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;No one tracked Dallas’s failing kidneys or Robert’s repossessed car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These patients are pioneers. During the second world war, plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe treated severely burned pilots. His patients formed the &lt;a href="https://www.eastgrinsteadmuseum.org.uk/guinea-pig-club/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Guinea Pig Club,&lt;/a&gt; a brotherhood that acknowledged their experimental status openly. They received lifelong care, peer support, and recognition for their contribution to advancing surgery. We can’t say the same for face transplant recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One question remains: how can science and medicine ethically innovate, without knowing what has gone before?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most innovation follows the same trend: the possibility is raised, there’s ethical debates, someone breaks cover and there’s a race to join in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These innovations usually end one of three ways: they fade quietly into history, they implode in scandal, or they mature into a stable, standardized practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Reality is now forcing that question for face transplants. Roughly 20% of patients have died – from rejection, kidney failure, heart failure. That’s an unacceptably high toll for an elective, supposedly “life-enhancing” procedure, especially when we still can’t agree on who is an ideal candidate, how to measure success, or what long-term support actually looks like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;We have seen this before – in lobotomy, a field that faded out. The Portuguese physician Egas Moniz won the Nobel Prize for developing lobotomy in 1949 and 3,500 brutal procedures were performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The same arc unfolded for vaginal meshes in the 1990s. Introduced with great fanfare, they caused chronic pain and organ damage, led to millions in lawsuits, and became synonymous with prioritizing profits over patient safety. Unlike face transplants, vaginal mesh victims found strength in numbers – 100,000 alone in the US took legal action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A more successful innovation story is IVF, which moved from controversial “test-tube baby” experiments into mainstream medicine by rigorous patient selection, improved safety standards, and proper regulation – all of which were led by surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Which path will face transplants take? The numbers are already slipping – fewer procedures since the 2010s as outcomes falter and budgets shrink. And unless the field raises its standards, enforces rigorous follow-up, and commits to transparent, systematic data sharing that actually includes patients and their families, there’s no way to demonstrate real success. Without that, face transplants aren’t headed for evolution or stability; they’re headed straight for the dustbin of medical history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Isabelle’s loved one is watching closely. It is not easy for her to speak out, even now, for fear that the family will be harassed by journalists. But, she says, “I must find the strength.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Isabelle did not want the transplants to continue. She had collected documents to prove the various dysfunctions and told me that after her death I could talk about everything because during her lifetime, she feared the medical team, the pressure was too strong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She felt obliged to be upbeat, to represent innovation success, whatever the cost – an insurmountable amount of pressure for someone who is already vulnerable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You only hear from the complainers,” one delegate told me earlier this year, after I spoke at a talk to face transplant surgeons at an international conference in Helsinki. “The happy patients are quietly living their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Such claims are meaningless without accurate data. And patients are often scared to tell surgeons the truth; even without the power imbalances of healthcare, people feel ungrateful or worry about being a “bad patient”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet they are the only ones who know if face transplants are a success. They are the ones who live with the reality of a face transplant after the news has broken and the cameras move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Are things changing? Not fast enough. The same pattern repeats with each innovation: surgeons pioneer, patients sacrifice, papers get published, the field moves on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I saw Robert recently in an online meeting to discuss a Department of Defense grant aimed at improving standards. He had recently left the hospital after another round of rejection, and was one of three patients sharing experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He looked tired and unimpressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Everybody here is getting paid,” he said. “Except us.

lead to psychological dissatisfaction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, since everyone’s “physiology is unique,” it’s “not possible for everyone to get the same results,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woman

cannot always keep up with &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/jessica-simpson-alls-fair-character-gets-botched-plastic-surgery/" class=" staff-link"&gt;the exaggerated expectations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Only a certain amount of fat can be safely transferred during the surgery, and a portion of that fat will naturally be absorbed by the body during recovery,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because of this, the final result may not match the exaggerated looks people frequently see online,” he continued. “There are many misleading photos and &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/jessica-alves-fifth-facelift-cosmetic-surgery-turkey/" class=" staff-link"&gt;unrealistic examples on social media&lt;/a&gt;, so patients’ expectations can easily

whether there are any procedures he personally refuses to perform, Dr. Fuat said he doesn’t prefer performing butt implant surgeries because they “carry a higher risk of recovery and &lt;a

be particularly difficult to maintain hygiene in that area during the healing process because it involves stitches, and the risk of infection is higher,” he said. “Patient safety always comes first,

asserted the importance of patients seeking information from qualified, experienced, and ethical practitioners, as they will likely explain the realities of cosmetic surgery during consultations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also wise to ask for photos of previous patients who have undergone similar procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, patients should understand that the results they see online cannot always be perfectly replicated because of anatomical limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For this very reason, the surgeon’s role is extremely important in providing proper guidance, managing expectations, and transparently explaining what the realistic outcome will look like,” he said. “Clearly communicating the expected outcome is critical in preventing postoperative regret.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;“I’m so mad I did that sh**,” one celebrity said, expressing regret over the procedure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woman in a fitted white dress and long black

                &lt;p&gt;Dr. Christine Hall grew up in the UK but spent most of her summers in South Korea, which gave her an appreciation of both Western and Korean skincare cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The qualified physician and pharmacist-turned "&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/beauty/aestura-atobarrier-365-cream-review" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;glass skin&lt;/a&gt;" specialist told Business Insider that she combines West and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/olive-young-seoul-recommended-products-skincare-oily-skin-2025-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Korean skincare products&lt;/a&gt; and techniques to keep her skin looking radiant and aging healthily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ideally, I would want that kind of flawless, dewy, glowy skin," she said, but is also realistic, adding: "If you had &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/skincare-supplements-pharmacist-clear-youthful-skin-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;poreless skin&lt;/a&gt;, your skin wouldn't be healthy. Your pores are normal anatomy, they're there for a reason."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the West, potent active ingredients like retinol and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reference/the-best-ingredients-for-acne" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;salicylic acid&lt;/a&gt;, which address concerns such as inflammation, pimples, or fine lines, are the focus. The &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/olive-young-seoul-recommended-products-skincare-oily-skin-2025-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Korean approach prioritizes&lt;/a&gt; strengthening the skin barrier, the outermost layer that protects us from pathogens and toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In Korea, your skincare routine is almost like a ritual," Hall said. "They like their steps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall's 13-step daily skincare routine often sees her smoothing hydrating creams and silky serums onto her face while watching TV with her Korean mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all of it is strictly necessary, she said, but there are steps she never misses: "They're the three things that we have the most evidence for that are proven to be antiaging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3b397585-157e-4369-a4d7-e19b2b29f900" data-toc-id="3b397585-157e-4369-a4d7-e19b2b29f900"&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/h2&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hall uses a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vitamin-c-for-skin-best-serum-when-how-use-2023-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;vitamin C serum&lt;/a&gt; in the mornings. Vitamin C is an antioxidant, meaning it helps prevent cells from being damaged through oxidative stress, a process that is linked to aging and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that applying vitamin C to the skin might have antiaging effects, as it is thought to promote collagen production, the primary building block of skin that we naturally make less of as we age. There is also some evidence that vitamin C can reduce the appearance of dark spots associated with aging and help protect against sun damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall uses the brand SkinCeutical's Silymarin CF Serum for blemish-prone skin, because she had acne in the past. Hall has worked with and has an ongoing contract with SkinCeuticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5c0a5433-21bb-467e-8658-cfba5bbaf9a5" data-toc-id="5c0a5433-21bb-467e-8658-cfba5bbaf9a5"&gt;Sunscreen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every morning, without fail, Hall puts on sunscreen. She uses an SPF 50+ cream for oily skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UV damage can prematurely age the skin, resulting in wrinkles, liver spots, and decreased elasticity. Research shows that SPF prevents UV rays from reaching and penetrating the skin when applied regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to use what's known as a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against both UVB rays, which cause sunburn, and UVA rays, which cause tanning and premature aging, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c2ebee08-f8d6-40e7-9626-4c4ff53a0e3d" data-toc-id="c2ebee08-f8d6-40e7-9626-4c4ff53a0e3d"&gt;Retinol&lt;/h2&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Originally a treatment for acne, retinol is now used for most common skin concerns, including dark spots, enlarged pores, fine lines, and wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retinol speeds up the turnover of skin cells, helps unclog pores, and increase collagen production, all of which help to make the skin look smoother and more youthful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall uses a retinol called tretinoin, which requires a prescription in the UK, but there are also plenty of over-the-counter retinol products. She &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/beauty/best-retinol-alternatives" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;added retinol &lt;/a&gt;to her skincare routine at the age of 35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She uses it at night and puts a Korean moisturizer on top, because retinol can cause dryness and potentially damage the skin barrier due to its potency, she said. Hall is a fan of the K-beauty brand Centellian 24's Madeca Cream, which contains ceramides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a balance of both that really worked," she said, of mixing Korean and Western products. "I think both cultures are seeing the value in each other."&lt;/p&gt;

It also supports vital functions like maintaining blood sugar levels and reducing stress on the kidneys. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;To understand which morning breakfast habits you should opt for and which to skip, HT Lifestyle reached out to Dr V Chandrasekaran, nephrologist and transplant physician at MGM Healthcare, Chennai, who revealed that breakfast mistakes can put kidney health in serious danger. Since the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/heart-surgeon-says-these-6-popular-healthy-foods-can-be-harmful-for-your-heart-and-kidneys-spinach-to-bananas-101763971496641.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="kidney"&gt;kidney&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for major functions like removing toxins and filtering waste from the blood, the first meal's mistakes cannot be overlooked, otherwise the adverse impact may be extensive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/27/550x309/sandwich_1764226701568_1764226701735.jpg" alt="Sandwich is one of the common breakfast option but the processed bread may not be healthy for kidney health.

Skipping breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping breakfast is common among people who follow intermittent fasting. They usually delay it to noon, especially if it's the 16/8 method, where you fast for 16 hours and eat for 8 hours. This habit is also seen among those who are in a rush and are getting late for work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sharing the kidney-related dangers of missing breakfast, the nephrologist added, “&lt;span&gt;Skipping breakfast disturbs glucose metabolism and promotes insulin resistance, leading to overeating later in the day, a direct path to obesity, diabetes, and hypertension.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, Dr Chandrasekaran recommended eating a balanced breakfast with complex carbs like oats, millets, lean proteins like eggs, paneer or sprouts and fibre-rich fruits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Eating processed food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are instant, ready-to-eat and convenient. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Processed foods may seem easy to put together, but they are high in preservative content and salt, which may pose a major problem for the kidneys.&lt;/span&gt; The doctor said, “ &lt;span&gt;Hidden salt in processed foods like bread, pickles, and cheese increases blood pressure and stresses the kidneys."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are wondering what the daily salt intake should be, the doctor recommended it to be under one teaspoon daily at breakfast. If you are looking for savoury foods, Dr Chandrasekaran shared home-cooked, low-salt Indian foods like idli, poha, or upma made without pickles&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Eating food with too much sugar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/27/original/2148362271_1764228348949.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Avoid sugary cereals for breakfast!(Picture credit: Freepik)" title="Avoid sugary cereals for breakfast!(Picture credit: Freepik)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Avoid sugary cereals for breakfast!(Picture credit: Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similarly, just like salt, another common breakfast mistake is too much sugar! It can creep into breakfast cereals or baked goods. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The doctor noted that even sweetened tea, packaged juices, and bakery products need to be monitored because they can spike blood sugar and cause insulin resistance, which is bad for kidney health. &lt;/span&gt;He suggested choosing fresh, whole foods like fruit, whole grains or a sugar-free cup of tea or coffee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4.Processed meats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/27/original/bacon_1764228273459.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Choose the better protein and think twice before adding bacon to your breakfast, at least not regularly because they are processed in nature.

(Picture credit: Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Popular breakfasts usually include processed meats like bacon, sausages, and ham. These meats contain high amounts of salt and phosphates that strain kidney functions. It's better to opt for natural proteins like boiled eggs, paneer or nuts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The nephrologist also shed light on common Indian dishes, which may not be healthy for breakfast every day, like paratha puri, as they contain excess ghee or salt and are deep-fried.&lt;/span&gt; He called it ‘kidney-unfriendly.’ &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Likewise for idli, dosa, he also suggested reducing salt in the batter and highly recommended skipping added oil, pickle and choosing healthy, home-made tomato, mint chutney.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are looking for an ideal breakfast that contain all your favourites while also balancing nutrition and kidney health, Dr Chandrasekaransaid, “&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Two idlis or one dosa (lightly oiled), one boiled egg or sprouts/paneer cubes, a small bowl of fruit (papaya, apple, or orange), nuts, and one to two glasses of water before chai or coffee.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end, it is important to note that your daily breakfast habits are responsible for shaping your health and supporting major physiological functions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Issues such as obesity, high blood pressure and insulin resistance place strain on the body's metabolic and vascular systems. Over time, this buildup of stress can accelerate cognitive decline and raise the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Arizona State University, working with partners at several institutions, now report that these effects may appear much earlier than expected. In young adults with obesity, the team identified biological markers linked to inflammation, liver strain and early injury to brain cells. These small but measurable shifts resemble patterns seen in older adults with cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study uncovered another important finding. Many of the young adults showed unusually low blood levels of choline, a nutrient essential for supporting liver health, regulating inflammation and protecting long-term brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research adds to the growing evidence that choline is a valuable marker of metabolic and brain dysfunction -- and reinforces the importance of sufficient daily intake, as it is essential for human health," says Ramon Velazquez. "Several new reports published this month further link reduced blood choline levels to behavioral changes, including anxiety and memory impairment, as well as broader metabolic dysfunction."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Velazquez leads the study as part of the ASU-Banner Neurodegenerative Disease Research Center, working with colleagues from the ASU School of Life Sciences, Banner Sun Health Research Institute and Mayo Clinic, AZ. The findings were published in &lt;em&gt;Aging and Disease&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obesity's Early Impact on Brain Biology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although obesity is widely known to increase the risk of chronic conditions such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, this study suggests its influence on the brain may develop much earlier. The researchers measured elevated levels of inflammation-promoting proteins and enzymes that indicate liver stress. They also detected higher levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), a protein released when neurons are damaged. NfL was linked to low blood choline levels in these young adults, even though no behavioral changes would typically be expected at this age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NfL has emerged as an important early signal of neurodegeneration. It is found at elevated levels in people with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Observing these markers in young adults is significant and suggests that obesity may create measurable effects in the brain well before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results support the idea that inflammation, metabolic strain and early neuronal changes may be connected in a way that starts much earlier in life than once believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choline's Influence on Brain and Metabolic Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central aspect of the study involves choline, a nutrient essential for cell-membrane structure, inflammation control, liver function and the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter important for memory. Participants with obesity had substantially lower levels of circulating choline, and these reductions corresponded with stronger signs of inflammation, insulin resistance, liver-enzyme elevation and NfL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the liver produces some choline, most must come from food. Rich dietary sources include eggs, poultry, fish, beans and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower and brussels sprouts. The researchers also observed that women in the study had lower choline levels than men, a notable finding because women experience higher rates of cognitive aging and Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National nutrition surveys show that many Americans do not meet recommended choline intake, especially teenagers and young adults. Since choline supports the brain and liver, long-term shortages may heighten vulnerability to metabolic stress and intensify the effect obesity has on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most people don't realize they aren't getting enough choline," said Wendy Winslow, first co-author. "Adding choline-rich foods to your routine can help reduce inflammation and support both your body and brain as you age."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrient Considerations for New Weight-Loss Drugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern weight-loss drugs have transformed obesity treatment because of their effectiveness in reducing weight and improving metabolic and cardiovascular health. However, the appetite-suppressing effects of GLP-1 medications significantly reduce food intake. This may lead to inadequate consumption of choline and other key nutrients. The authors note the need for future studies to explore whether pairing GLP-1 therapies with adequate dietary choline can help maintain metabolic resilience and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Design and Key Measurements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research involved 30 adults in their 20s and 30s, split evenly between those with obesity and those of healthy weight. Each participant provided a fasting blood sample. The samples were analyzed for circulating choline, inflammatory cytokines, insulin, glucose, liver enzymes, additional metabolic measures and NfL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparisons between groups revealed consistent patterns: lower choline levels, greater inflammation, metabolic stress and signs of neuronal damage in young adults with obesity. To understand how these findings relate to brain aging, the team compared their results with data from older adults diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same pairing of low choline and high NfL was found in both young and older adults. This suggests that biological changes associated with Alzheimer's may begin many years before symptoms arise, especially in people experiencing metabolic stress or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Indicators of Long-Term Cognitive Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study highlights a strong link among obesity, inflammation, choline status and early neuronal stress. This combination may help explain why metabolic disorders increase the likelihood of cognitive decline later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the study does not establish causation, it reveals a group of biomarkers that closely resemble those found in older adults with cognitive impairment. The results also align with earlier rodent studies showing that inadequate choline intake in mice can lead to obesity, metabolic problems and increased Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results suggest that, in young adults, good metabolic health and adequate choline contribute to neuronal health, laying the groundwork for healthy aging," says Jessica Judd, co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ongoing research will continue exploring how early metabolic stress may shape long-term risk for neurodegenerative disease and could eventually inform new strategies to protect brain health across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

He explains, “When you fast, your body and cells get time to heal. During fasting, cells enter a maintenance mode, which helps the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/immune-system" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="immune system"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; function better and removes damaged or negative cells. This repair process is essential for overall health and cellular rejuvenation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="embed_div"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Addressing a common misconception, Dr Krishna warns, “Many people believe that a &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/common-mistakes-people-make-on-ketogenic-diet-101717249033947.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="ketogenic diet"&gt;ketogenic diet&lt;/a&gt; can cure cancer. That’s not true. The body only enters a ketogenic state when it is necessary, and following such a diet blindly can be harmful.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Is ketogenic diet always safe for cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasises the importance of personalised guidance: “Only consider a ketogenic diet if your cell or gene expression indicates it would be beneficial. Half knowledge can be dangerous and may do more harm than good.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Krishna adds that while intermittent fasting can support cellular repair, immune health, and metabolic balance, it should always be approached thoughtfully. “Incorporating &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/fasting" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="fasting"&gt;fasting&lt;/a&gt; into your routine can be beneficial, but it must be done under professional supervision, especially for individuals with specific health conditions or those undergoing cancer treatment.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.
