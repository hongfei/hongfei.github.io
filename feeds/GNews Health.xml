All members of the committee  were recently replaced after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired everyone on the previous panel earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s changes  have been criticized by mainstream medical groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC is now recommending that children under the age of 4 no longer get a combination vaccine that protects against four diseases: the chickenpox (also known as varicella), measles, mumps and rubella. Instead, the CDC now recommends two separate shots, one just against chickenpox, and the other that protects against measles, mumps and rubella. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC has also now officially lifted its recommendation that adults under age 65 get the updated COVID-19 vaccine. The CDC now says the decision on whether an adult under age 65 gets a COVID-19 vaccine should be based on “individual-based decision-making” in consultation with health professionals like a physician, nurse or pharmacist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matches a change in recommendations made to the childhood vaccination schedule earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made by acting CDC director Jim O’Neill, a top deputy to Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic. O’Neill replaced Susan Monarez, who was fired as CDC director after 29 days on the job. Monarez said she was terminated after she pushed back against an effort by her bosses to undermine vaccines; Kennedy said she was fired because she said she was not trustworthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Neill has no training in medicine or healthcare and holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees in humanities, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/jim-oneill-cdc-kennedy-trump-vaccines-58fd24f678bf46ea6ec96a2b09f85ff4" target="_blank"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;, and is a former investor who has been a critic of health regulations. He has previously worked at the Department of Health and Human Services, serving six years under President George W. Bush. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Neill’s announcement said that the changes will still allow for immunization coverage to continue through programs including  the Vaccines for Children program, Children’s Health Insurance Program, Medicare and Medicaid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy for Pediatrics in late September criticized the change, which removed the option for toddlers to get a single shot that can protect against chickenpox, measles, mumps and rubella. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acting CDC director’s statement, issued by the press office of the Department of Health and Human Services, raised concerns about an increased risk of febrile seizure caused by fever after getting the combined chickenpox, measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (known as MMRV) versus those given the chickenpox vaccine separately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics said that in a meeting last month, some of the CDC’s new vaccine advisors “at times...misrepresented data and used talking points common among anti-vaccine groups. Some seemed unfamiliar with febrile seizures. They also disregarded CDC assurances that febrile seizures after MMRV are rare and do not have long-term impacts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends that all adults get the updated COVID-19 vaccine, especially those with risk conditions and people who have never gotten a COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health has slightly different &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Pages/public-health-for-all/publichealthforall.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. The agency recommends that adults younger than 65 with risk factors get the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as all adults who are in close contact with others with risk factors, and everyone who chooses to get vaccinated. The agency also recommends that all seniors get vaccinated against COVID-19. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 16:52:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPZURMTmpNQnh5ZGp1RFFFUUN5NnMyUGVRd0k0b3ZfQXB4XzFIS1g5T0wtZEs2SmQ1c0h5ZVgzS19kNzh5Y1hzbjJNVlJuUnk5YnVuQ01Gc01nb0hCcTJ6SGtzZ0laMGFUREoxbVB6ZHE4U3NCaFgwbkRUalE4VmRFbi1mQm05SzdEeWRfX0J3dHpRTzJLUzNIUWNDbFc3THp6ZnQ0Rk9R</guid></item><item><title>比以往任何时候都有更多的孩子死于季节性流感- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/more-kids-are-dying-from-seasonal-flu-than-ever-2000668078</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The seasonal flu is, without a doubt, back, and it’s killing more children than ever. New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that reported child flu deaths reached a record high last winter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CDC experts laid out the sobering data in a paper &lt;a href="https://cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; late last month. At least 280 children died of the flu during the 2024 to 2025 season—the highest such toll recorded since modern tracking began two decades ago. It’s the second straight winter that pediatric deaths have reached a record peak, which may not bode well for this upcoming flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A modern worst for flu&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The seasonal flu, like many infectious diseases, took a hiatus during the first years of the covid-19 pandemic. The same measures taken to reduce the spread of the pandemic, such as social distancing, also substantially reduced transmission of flu and other garden-variety germs. But as the world returned to normal, so too did diseases like influenza.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Flu cases, hospitalizations, and deaths began to climb back to their usual trends during the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2022-2023.html"&gt;2022 to 2023 season&lt;/a&gt;. But last winter’s flu was one of the worst ever recorded in modern history. It was the first high-severity flu season for age groups &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7434a1.htm#:~:text=CDC%20classified%20the%20U.S.%202024%E2%80%9325%20influenza%20season%20as%20a%20high%2Dseverity%20season%20for%20all%20age%20groups%2C%20making%20it%20the%20first%20such%20season%20since%202017%E2%80%9318"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; since the 2017-2018 season; the cumulative hospitalization rate was the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7434a1.htm"&gt;highest&lt;/a&gt; recorded since the 2010-2011 season; and between 27,000 and 130,000 flu-associated deaths occurred, based on the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html"&gt;preliminary estimates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Since 2004, doctors and hospitals have been obligated to report any child deaths linked to flu to their local health departments; this then allows the CDC to directly track U.S. flu deaths in children for any given season. The 280 pediatric deaths seen last winter are the highest toll recorded in the modern era, and only slightly below the 288 deaths seen during the &lt;span tabindex="0" role="tooltip"&gt;&lt;span class="c5aZPb" tabindex="0" role="button" data-enable-toggle-animation="true" data-extra-container-classes="ZLo7Eb" data-hover-hide-delay="1000" data-hover-open-delay="500" data-send-open-event="true" data-theme="0" data-width="250" data-ved="2ahUKEwijm6q064-QAxX4vokEHXqtN8QQmpgGegQIKhAD"&gt;&lt;span class="JPfdse" data-bubble-link="" data-segment-text="H1N1"&gt;H1N1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; flu pandemic of 2009-2010.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Nearly all these deaths occurred among unvaccinated children (89%), while about half happened in children with no preexisting health conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A sign of things to come?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The strength of this upcoming flu season will depend on many factors, including the inherent severity of the flu strains circulating around the world. But there are already reasons why we should be worried about how hard next winter’s flu will hit children (and adults, for that matter).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For starters, the flu vaccination coverage was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html#:~:text=As%20of%20April%2026%2C%202025%2C%2049.2%25%20(95%25%20Confidence%20Interval%20%5BCI%5D%2048.2%E2%80%9350.1)%20of%20children%20received%20a%20flu%20vaccination%2C%20lower%20than%20last%20season%20at%20this%20same%20time%20point%20(53.4%25)."&gt;lower&lt;/a&gt; for children last winter than it was the previous flu season. And in fact, the flu vaccination rate in general has been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/coverage-by-season/2023-2024.html"&gt;sliding&lt;/a&gt; compared to before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The anti-vaccination movement has also reached new heights of power, thanks to the installation of figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the Trump administration. In less than a year’s time, RFK Jr. and his allies have succeeded at &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-vaccine-panel-votes-against-thimerosal-flu-shots-citing-debunked-risks-2000620214"&gt;removing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-handpicked-vaccine-panel-nixes-measles-chickenpox-combo-for-kids-under-4-2000660333"&gt;weakening&lt;/a&gt; several childhood vaccines based on shoddy evidence, and they’ve &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/its-too-much-liquid-trump-rfk-jr-still-gunning-for-vaccines-as-autism-cause-2000662667"&gt;continued to promote&lt;/a&gt; the widely debunked link between vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Most Americans do still &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/americans-are-already-sick-of-rfk-jr-poll-finds-2000665089"&gt;support vaccines,&lt;/a&gt; generally. And Kennedy has continued to &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/uritheflu/116880"&gt;quietly endorse&lt;/a&gt; the seasonal flu vaccine for children and adults (for now at least). But his &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/06/nx-s1-5493544/rfk-defunding-mrna-vaccine-research"&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/moderna-pulls-licensing-submission-combo-flu-covid-vaccine"&gt;changes&lt;/a&gt; and public podium could certainly increase vaccine hesitancy for the flu shot and others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seasonal flu vaccines aren’t 100% effective at preventing infection. But they have and will remain highly effective at preventing the worst outcomes of flu, including severe illness and death. So if children and their families aren’t getting vaccinated against flu, it may not take long to reach another new record high in child flu deaths.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

They might miss a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but they’re not preoccupied by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"If alcohol is taking up a lot of mental space during this month, it suggests it might have a bigger role in your life than you’ve acknowledged."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;If you're going sober for October but can't stop thinking about alcohol, that's a problem (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counting down to the end of Sober October&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If alcohol is on your mind during a month you're going without it, then another sign might be your thoughts settling on that first drink you'll have after it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Skip ahead to 1 November, your Halloween party is done and dusted, and you're already back on the sauce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The doctor suggested that if you're counting the days until you can drink again, that ought to be a red flag when you could be enjoying October as much as the weather permits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;If you're just counting down the days until you can drink again that's a problem (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding social gatherings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This is one that several people who've spoken about their negative experiences with alcohol have talked about as an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Speaking to LADbible for Dry January, Jay Motty said &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/lifestyle/dry-january-advice-going-sober-606046-20250131"&gt;it was the 'biggest myth'&lt;/a&gt; that you couldn't socialise without a drink, but there are people who will be ducking out of social gatherings because alcohol will be there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The doc said you should think about why you're not going, and if it's because you think you'll be boring without the booze or you're worried you'll be the only sober person there, then that's another warning sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Jay's advice for Dry January, which also applies to Sober October, is to tell your friends you're not drinking ahead of time so they're on the same page as you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He added that they might even be relieved if they've spotted your alcohol problem before you've cottoned on, since they won't have to babysit you and can focus on having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;You might find yourself skipping social situations to avoid alcohol (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A foul mood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If you're addicted to something and not getting it then your mind is going to be in a terrible state as you suffer through withdrawal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Doc Pemberton said that a functioning alcoholic might use booze to manage stress and wind down after a busy day, and without that routine, you might be in a bad mood for the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Cutting down on the alcohol will eventually get you &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/one-month-no-alcohol-what-happens-067282-20240813"&gt;in a much better mood&lt;/a&gt;, but the first days and weeks are among the most difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Telling yourself a bit of rule bending is fine is not going to work (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaking the rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The rules of Sober October are pretty clear: you don't drink a drop of alcohol all month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, the doctor suggested that if you're breaking those rules, it's a bad sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He said getting around the alcohol restrictions by telling yourself one drink is fine or that you're at an event where others are drinking so you have to as well, like a wedding, wasn't going to cut the mustard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;You can tell yourself there's a justified reason, but the medical opinion is that it's 'just your brain trying to convince you that you need alcohol'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;It's a good month to take stock and evaluate your relationship with alcohol (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The desire for a drink&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If you are an alcoholic and you get through those first hellish days of withdrawal symptoms, then you'll start to see the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/timeline-everything-happens-body-dry-january-822419-20241231"&gt;benefits in body and mind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;That might sound great, but Dr Pemberton warns that if you start seeing the benefits of going sober but you're still desiring a drink then you ought to dig down into why and think about what it is about alcohol that you want so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;All in all, taking a break for a month is a good way of evaluating your relationship with alcohol, and there are people you can turn to for help if you're having trouble navigating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please drink responsibly.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9mxwel000gmom7zia3bz95@published"&gt;After complications from a bladder prolapse surgery, a patient named Grace developed a hematoma, or pooling of blood, and she needed pelvic floor physical therapy to help her pelvic muscles relax after holding such a large mass of blood. Without PFPT, Grace’s pelvic pain could get so severe that it was unbearable to sit down, and even after her hematoma disappeared, Grace still got flares: sudden onsets of pain that she says felt “like somebody was literally putting a vise into my vagina.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myflv001b3b79z24nvjeg@published"&gt;Even though Grace sometimes rated these flares as high as 9 out of 10 on the pain scale, her insurance company was skeptical about whether her PFPT was medically necessary, constantly demanding reevaluations that forced Grace to temporarily put her treatment on hold. During these breaks, Grace had no way to handle flares aside from making a note to bring them up with a provider later. “I think it took me longer to get better because I had to keep taking breaks,” she says. “I definitely got into very dark places at times. The pain was very triggering.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myflw001c3b79l54bfb4n@published"&gt;Grace has also been to physical therapy for a torn rotator cuff in her shoulder—a much smoother process. “I don’t even need to get a doctor’s script for my shoulder,” she says, “but trying to get pelvic PT, you’d think I was asking for a new kidney or something.” Because common knowledge about pelvic health is low, with many patients feeling uncomfortable openly discussing this area of the body, the gravity of pelvic issues often goes overlooked. “I think people can understand a torn rotator cuff,” Grace says, “but they can’t necessarily understand pelvic hematoma until they’ve had one.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myflx001d3b79x7aq9geh@published"&gt;Pelvic floor therapy is a form of physical therapy focused on the group of muscles and tissues that support the bladder, bowel, and reproductive organs. When these muscles become overly tight or loose, patients can experience issues like pelvic pain, pelvic organ prolapse, sexual dysfunction, and incontinence—which all have serious implications if left untreated. Pelvic floor therapy is used to either strengthen or relax these muscles through techniques including physical exercises, lifestyle modifications, and manual therapy, where the provider applies pressure to the pelvic area.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfly001e3b799yl6symu@published"&gt;For some patients, pelvic floor therapy serves a purpose as fundamental as allowing them to sit in a chair without excruciating pain or leave the house without needing to access a bathroom every 15 minutes. Despite this, Grace’s experience is an extremely common one, since insurance policies that restrict appointment timing and limit the types of covered interventions or diagnoses have forced many pelvic floor therapists in the U.S. to stop accepting health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfly001f3b79tm68pfkt@published"&gt;Pelvic health disorders can affect patients of any gender, but they’re &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/pelvic-floor-issues-arent-just-a-womans-health-condition-kegels-can-work-for-men-too/"&gt;about twice as common in women&lt;/a&gt;, and pelvic floor therapy is often falsely perceived as a women’s health treatment. This means not only that awareness about male pelvic health remains extremely low, but also that pelvic floor therapy is undervalued in a way that’s typical for female-specific treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfly001g3b79t205l8ce@published"&gt;Insurance policies also fail to take harder-to-quantify aspects of treatment into account when determining coverage, which is particularly problematic when it comes to pelvic floor therapy. Feelings of trust between patients and providers are especially crucial in a specialty like pelvic floor therapy. Because symptoms are located in an intimate area of the body, patients may feel embarrassed or vulnerable talking about them with providers, especially when symptoms stem from past sexual trauma. Patients may also feel distressed about undressing and undergoing manual therapy with a provider they don’t fully trust, which can make it hard to make progress. Plus, patients with pelvic floor issues have often been frequently dismissed by other providers who lack knowledge about their conditions, and they may take longer to trust a new provider after being failed repeatedly in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfm0001h3b79elehc9ip@published"&gt;“Insurance companies don’t pay you to talk to patients. They pay you to do things with patients,” says Michelle Thibeault, a pelvic floor physical therapist in Meriden, Connecticut. Because most insurance policies reimburse providers with a flat per-service rate, which doesn’t increase with longer appointment times, providers like Thibeault have to keep appointments short to cover the costs of keeping their practices running. That means that the crucial conversation it takes to look at a patient holistically, taking individual lifestyle factors into account, is often what gets cut out first.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfm1001i3b796cqw9qxc@published"&gt;Jessie Klein used to be at an in-network practice before opening Willow Pelvic Health, a private PFPT practice based in New York and New Jersey. Though appointments were 60 minutes long at her former practice, Klein saw two patients per hour, working with one at a time while the other did exercises with an assistant. Because Klein values one-on-one time with patients, she decided not to accept insurance at Willow. “You can think with better clinical rationale and creatively, as opposed to having to just maximize the time you have,” she explains. Klein also recognizes that some in-network providers struggle with burnout because they’re incentivized to see as many patients as possible. “The job is nonstop,” she says. “You sometimes don’t have a break to go to the bathroom.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfm2001j3b796lekfoqz@published"&gt;Other providers add that insurance companies don’t always cover all of their necessary interventions. Pelvic floor occupational therapist Marlene Handler, for example, says many insurance companies refuse to cover the relaxation techniques she uses to assuage patients’ anxiety, overlooking that patients have to be in the right state of mind before other tactics can be applied. “If you don’t feel safe in your own body, it doesn’t matter what kind of skills I have as a clinician,” Handler says. “Your body will not recover.” Since leaving the insurance model to open the Lifted Lotus, a private pelvic floor therapy office in Brooklyn, she notices that her patients are improving faster—often requiring only about five to seven sessions, while many at her former practice returned for months on end before making progress.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfm2001k3b79yur9qkj0@published"&gt;For some patients, challenges with coverage feed into existing apprehension about undergoing such a vulnerable therapy. “For me, with this kind of pain, there’s an element of always trying to get out of dealing with it,” says one patient who asked to remain anonymous. After being forced to quit PFPT due to the cost, she says, “It felt like I was able to sneakily, but intentionally, ignore the issue.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfm2001l3b79vt0jcecb@published"&gt;Marlene Berke was first referred to PFPT when she was 21 and found herself unable to have sex. “By unable,” Berke explains, “I mean if I tried, I’d get sharp, stinging, burning pain.” Berke had to wait three months to see a PFPT who took her insurance, which only prolonged her uncertainty about the cause of her pain.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfm2001m3b79j15vhim0@published"&gt;What Berke didn’t know was that those three months were just the beginning of what’s now been a seven-year ordeal of switching from PT to PT, with each new practice presenting a brand-new set of obstacles. For a while, Berke drove 40 minutes each way to see the closest provider that took her insurance. Later, she gave in and paid hundreds per session to see a private therapist, because her pain was so severe that she could barely walk. “I was so scared that something was seriously damaged or wrong because it was hurting so much,” she explains. Berke has a Ph.D. in computational cognitive science from Yale, and she says trying to get effective treatment was more onerous than the six years of getting her degree.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg9myfm3001n3b79ks4gntnn@published"&gt;Many providers are fighting to increase access to pelvic floor therapy—for example, Handler says, she uses her position on the board of the New York State Occupational Therapy Association to build awareness about the essential nature of pelvic health care. Still, there’s only so much that can happen without larger-scale changes to the U.S. health insurance system, which fails to recognize the value of treatments requiring high levels of patient-provider interaction. When asked what could make it easier for pelvic floor therapists to work in the insurance network, Klein says, “I don’t even think it’s within reality in our current health care system. I couldn’t even tell you a tangible &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;solution.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's closely linked to obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-0cd933a0-a059-11f0-8797-d139455908ff"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While many people may be familiar with jaundice (the yellowing of the skin), according to Dr Deshauer, the liver can reveal its distress in unexpected ways, starting at your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An estimated 80 to 100 million adults in the US may have fatty liver disease and are unaware of it. The liver often remains silent even when diseased (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Your fingernails are constantly growing through a complex, energy-intensive process,' she said in a YouTube video. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because of that, changes in your overall health often show up there first - and liver disease is no exception.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the first signs Dr Deshauer mentions is Muehrcke's lines on fingernails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'These are horizontal white lines that run across the nails, not on the nail plate itself, but in the tissue underneath. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can test it yourself: apply pressure to the nail and the lines will temporarily disappear. Since they're in the nail bed, they don't grow out with the nail.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These lines are linked to low levels of albumin, a crucial protein made by the liver that helps keep fluid in your blood vessels, transports hormones and drugs, and maintains pH balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Low albumin can lead to swelling, fatigue, poor healing, and drug buildup, often due to liver disease, kidney problems, or malnutrition. High albumin is rare and usually caused by dehydration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another subtle but important clue is a condition called Terry's nails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Normally, nails have a pinkish hue due to blood vessels under the nail bed,' Dr Deshauer explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But with liver disease, that tissue changes and becomes pale. If the lunula, the half-moon at the base of the nail, is still visible, that's normal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But when the whole nail is ghostly white, I start thinking about liver dysfunction.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like Muehrcke's lines, Terry's nails also reflect low albumin levels seen in liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Deshauer also sounded the alarm about 'nail clubbing'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ask someone to place their nails back-to-back,' she says, demonstrating with her own hands in a YouTube video. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If there's a diamond-shaped gap between the nails, that's normal. If not, and the nails appear bulbous or rounded, that's clubbing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clubbing can be genetic, but when new or unexplained, it often suggests chronic problems involving the heart, lungs, or liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A distended abdomen is another major warning sign of liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People often assume the person is pregnant,' Dr Deshauer says, pointing to an image of a woman with a swollen belly. 'But it's actually ascites, fluid buildup in the abdomen caused by portal hypertension, a result of advanced liver scarring.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Portal hypertension is high blood pressure in the vein that carries blood to the liver, usually caused by liver scarring (cirrhosis), leading to complications like variceal bleeding, fluid buildup, and spleen enlargement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This fluid can total more than 500floz in extreme cases, leading to difficulty breathing and severe discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While liver disease is hard to diagnose, Toronto-based Dr Siobhan Deshauer says there are 12 tell-tale signs that she always looks for in patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be treated with a procedure called paracentesis, where doctors drain the fluid with a needle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the more disturbing signs of liver disease is a phenomenon known as 'caput medusae.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a physical sign of portal hypertension impacting the intestines, spleen, pancreas, and liver, which manifests as engorged, snake-like veins radiating from the belly button area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As blood struggles to move through a scarred liver, it finds new routes. Tiny veins under the skin around the belly button start to bulge,' Dr Deshauer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It creates a web-like pattern we call caput medusae, named after the snake-haired figure from Greek mythology.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's not just visible veins that are a problem. Internally, especially in the esophagus, veins called varices can swell up and burst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Deshauer warns that this is one of the most dangerous complications of liver disease because if a swollen, abnormal vein ruptures, it can trigger life-threatening bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A more common symptom of liver disease involves having a red flush on the palms, a condition known as palmar erythema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It shows up over the thenar and hypothenar areas of the palm, but interestingly, it usually spares the center,' says Dr. Deshauer. 'The culprit? High estrogen levels.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Estrogen levels rise in liver disease because the liver can't break the hormone down properly. This can also lead to another telltale sign: spider nevi or tiny bursts of blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is true for both men and women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Spider nevi look like small red dots with tiny blood vessels radiating out,' Dr Deshauer said. 'If you press on them, they disappear - then refill when you release.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While one or two may be normal, three or more suggest elevated estrogen, particularly when the person isn't pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moving back to the hands, if you spot muscle wasting, this could be a cause for concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The liver helps metabolize nutrients and store energy,' Dr Deshauer says. 'When it's failing, the body begins breaking down muscle for fuel.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early muscle wasting in liver disease can be seen as visible thinning or hollowing of the muscles in the hands and temples, with prominent bones and sunken areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another symptom known as Dupuytren's contracture or the Viking grip also impacts the hands when it comes to liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This one is fascinating,' Dr Deshauer said. 'Dupuytren's contracture is when the fascia of the palm thickens and tightens, pulling the fingers inward.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Deshauer suggests trying the 'tabletop test.' This involves laying your palm flat on a surface. If you can't touch the table fully, it may be due to a contracture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The physician also recommends another test to detect liver problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Your fingernails are constantly growing through a complex, energy-intensive process,' says Dr Deshauer. 'Because of that, changes in your overall health often show up there first - and liver disease is no exception'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Ask the patient to hold their arms out and extend their wrists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In cases of [a condition known as] hepatic encephalopathy, they'll develop an involuntary flapping tremor - called asterixis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This neurological sign arises from ammonia buildup in the blood, a toxin that the liver normally clears. In advanced cases, patients may even develop confusion, personality changes, and, in extreme cases, coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the more subtle yet unpleasant ends of the spectrum, however, is bad breath. But it's different than typical morning breath, Dr Deshauer says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's a smell I'll never forget,' she said. 'It's sweet, almost musty, and it comes from toxins like dimethyl sulfide that are exhaled in liver failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We call it fetor hepaticus - literally, 'foul odor of the liver.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bad breath generally occurs in the later stages of liver disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last two symptoms the doctor covers are jaundice and bruising.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Jaundice happens when bilirubin builds up,' Dr. Deshauer explains. 'It turns the skin and eyes yellow, and even darkens urine to a tea color.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bilirubin is a byproduct of red blood cell breakdown, and when the liver can't process it, levels spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And lastly, in liver disease, the liver stops producing thrombopoietin (TPO), which is the key hormone that signals the bone marrow to make platelets, leading to thrombocytopenia (low platelets). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The liver is also responsible for synthesizing most blood-clotting factors, and its dysfunction leads to a decrease in these factors and impaired blood clotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These dysfunctions lead to unexplained bruising or excessive bleeding, which are sometimes the first outward signs of something wrong internally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It may be 'more reasonable to interpret restless legs syndrome as a potential risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease, rather than an early manifestation,' they added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Parkinson's disease occurs when brain cells called dopaminergic neurons progressively break down, leading to a deficiency of dopamine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This dopamine deficit impairs communication between brain cells, causing the  symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, slowed movement, and balance problems, because dopamine is essential for fine-tuning muscle control. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, the scientists from Korea University Ansan Hospital, tracked 19,838 patients, half of which had been &lt;span&gt;diagnosed with restless legs syndrome.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over a follow-up of 15 years on average, 1.6 per cent of those with the syndrome developed Parkinson's, compared to just one per cent without. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among those with restless leg syndrome, 0.5 per cent of patients taking dopamine agonists developed Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By contrast, 2.1 per cent of those not on medication were diagnosed with the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dopamine agonists are commonly prescribed not only for Parkinson's disease but also for moderate to severe restless legs syndrome, because dopamine is thought to play a role in both conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms can include uncontrollable tremors, slow movements and muscle stiffness, but experts say they often only appear when about 80 per cent of the nerve cells have been lost&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The dopamine agonist-treated group tended to be at decreased risk of developing Parkinson's disease, whereas the dopamine agonist-nontreated group tended to be at increased risk,' the researchers said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This suggests that the association between restless legs syndrome and Parkinson's disease might not be due to the dopaminergic pathway, but rather a different mechanism.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, it could involve another underlying process—such as inflammation or changes in how the brain's sensory systems work—that increases the risk of both, they suggested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it was vital further research was done to prove the findings, they added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also cautioned that the findings should be interpreted carefully, as the diagnoses were based on clinical judgement rather than laboratory tests, which could have led to some cases being missed or misclassified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For example, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, a well-known early feature of Parkinson's disease, may have been misdiagnosed as restless legs syndrome in some cases,' they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK around 166,000 people are living with Parkinson's, a figure that is worryingly expected to double by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While not directly fatal, the disease leaves sufferers more vulnerable to life-threatening infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Back to the Future film star, Michael J Fox, was diagnosed with Parkinson's at just 29, in 1991&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Famous figures who have battled the disease include actor Michael J. Fox, who was diagnosed in 1991 at just 29, and went public seven years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, the Back to the Future star has become the leading campaigner for research, founding The Michael J.

Earlier this year, Health Secretary Robert F. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-guts-acip-cdc-vaccine-panel-rcna211935" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy Jr. fired all 17 members&lt;/a&gt; of the influential vaccine panel, replacing them with his own picks, many of whom have spoken out against Covid vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5c18cb" class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy, a long-time anti-vaccine activist who has falsely&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;called the Covid vaccine the “deadliest vaccine ever made,” first &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-wants-limit-cdcs-role-infectious-diseases-rcna228543" target="_blank"&gt;moved to limit access to shots&lt;/a&gt; in May, when he bypassed the typical regulatory process and announced the CDC would no longer recommend Covid vaccines to healthy children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-391b91" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC’s sign-off on Monday does not mean people younger than 65 are barred from getting a Covid vaccine — they still can do so, after consulting with a doctor or pharmacist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b0b293" class="body-graf"&gt;Adding in this so-called shared clinical decision-making essentially “puts up one more little barrier” to getting the shot, said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of global health and infectious diseases at Stanford University. “It’s kind of a vague term that says you should have your doctor or your provider or pharmacist tell you what the risks and benefits are before you get the vaccine.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-838119" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC said that the vaccine panel's recommendations for people under 65 found the most benefit for someone at  increased risk for severe Covid due to underlying conditions. The benefit of vaccination was lowest for people under 65 who aren't at increased risk for severe Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b397c5" class="body-graf"&gt;But how easy it is to get a Covid shot may depend on where you live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b07538" class="body-graf"&gt;In previous years, states have generally mirrored the CDC’s vaccine guidance, particularly that of the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccine-eligibility-limit-over-65-health-conditions-cdc-rcna232374" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine advisory panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, ACIP&lt;/a&gt;, which had been considered one of the foremost authorities on vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-737bdb" class="body-graf"&gt;Prior to the CDC’s announcement, 26 states (mostly blue states with Democratic governors) had already set their own Covid shot guidance to keep access as broad as possible, according to &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/covid-19/tracking-state-actions-on-vaccine-policy-and-access/" target="_blank"&gt;KFF&lt;/a&gt;, a nonpartisan health policy research group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ca1e8d" class="body-graf"&gt;The result is a complex hodgepodge of Covid vaccine policies nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6d6a91" class="body-graf"&gt;“We now have had a breakdown in consensus between the federal government and the states as to how to manage Covid immunization,” said Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital. “We are facing an unprecedentedly complicated landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-467879" class="body-graf"&gt;Illinois, Maryland and Washington, D.C., for example, officially recommend universal Covid vaccination for everyone 6 months and older. Other states, like California, Michigan and Minnesota, recommend the shots for everyone 3 years and older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f973e" class="body-graf"&gt;“Viruses don’t respect state borders,” Levy said. “From the perspective of protecting the public against infectious diseases, the last thing you would want as a strategy is to protect different states differently. It’s confusing, it’s inconsistent, and it leaves certain people vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-18ea36" class="body-graf"&gt;What’s more, some doctors’ offices might not have any incentive to stock the vaccine since the CDC’s recommendation focuses on older adults. Last season, 23% of adults and 13% of children got the Covid vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-888eb6" class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s all kinds of ways where people who want the vaccine might not be able to get it because of all of these little obstacles that are put in place, even though, in theory, anybody 6 months and older should be able to get them,” said Maldonado, who is also a pediatrician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b2d6ac" class="body-graf"&gt;In a statement, Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS Health, said its pharmacies would be ready to administer Covid shots for people ages 5 and older as soon as the CDC signed off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aa63bd" class="body-graf"&gt;Walgreens starts Covid vaccines at age 3. A spokesperson for Walgreens said in an email that the pharmacy chain “will offer the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccines at locations nationwide” without a prescription. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-fed0a5" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need a Covid shot?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b3e482" class="body-graf"&gt;While a summer uptick in cases appears to have peaked in most areas of the country, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/surveillance/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, every year since the Covid pandemic started in 2020 has also had a winter wave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c3264b" class="body-graf"&gt;Like the flu shot, the Covid vaccine doesn't necessarily stop a person from getting infected with the virus. But it does reduce the chances of severe illness, hospitalization or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b3e3d" class="body-graf"&gt;Pfizer and Moderna’s updated Covid shots target the LP.8.1 variant, which was the dominant strain in the U.S. earlier this year but has been&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/variants/variants-and-genomic-surveillance.html" target="_blank"&gt; overtaken by newer variants&lt;/a&gt;. Novavax’s updated Covid shot targets an even older strain, called JN.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1838f1" class="body-graf"&gt;As of Sept. 27, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/variants/variants-and-genomic-surveillance.html" target="_blank"&gt;LP.8.1 accounts for just 3%&lt;/a&gt; of all new Covid cases, according to the CDC. A strain called XFG is now dominant, accounting for at least 85% of new Covid cases. All are descendants of the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/omicron-symptoms-covid-what-to-know-rcna9469" target="_blank"&gt;omicron variant&lt;/a&gt;, which emerged in late 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-faf171" class="body-graf"&gt;Research presented by Moderna and Pfizer at an &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/186595/download" target="_blank"&gt;FDA advisory committee meeting in May&lt;/a&gt; found that the updated shot generated a modestly stronger immune response to the strains circulating at that time than last year’s Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c3a43d" class="body-graf"&gt;It typically takes a few weeks after the Covid vaccine for immunity to build. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-99f37a" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the Covid shot free?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a548f8" class="body-graf"&gt;Most people with insurance who want a Covid vaccine should be able to get it free this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-347ae6" class="body-graf"&gt;Ahead of the CDC’s advisory committee meeting, &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/ahip-statement-on-vaccine-coverage" target="_blank"&gt;AHIP&lt;/a&gt;, a health insurance industry trade group, said that private plans will continue to cover all CDC-recommended vaccines that were recommended as of Sept. 1, meaning its previous Covid shot recommendation for everyone 6 months and older still applies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-449a61" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Medicare, Medicaid and other government health programs will continue to cover the shots at no cost, according to an HHS spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 14:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQWGRkbGZvRXY5WlFXTFo2OW81eDZmQWhIVVFtU3ZoUHdHMTFiTFNoNmhDTlJPNzZzTkpZZGNoOGY3WkpyQU44Y29DRk94WmxwX2wzTC1RaWJaMDZVVy04ZkJCZzlnOFpib3V5SWZSVndMd3BBaktGTkEtNElyanFadnpHd2dhUDl3cXpRUG53M1BEamhkREFCeGplV0ZKTl9LUG53SjhveEF3aV9aOXh2cmt0bGd3YVXSAVZBVV95cUxOcUhlQ2dYZmhRSUxqX1BZNGxta3NBYWNURGFiYVBBcnhlZWh1dkhtWUFJb0Z1ZVFubVE0V0loM0ozYjByZWY4dFowdUNRU0pxNzdDR05NQQ</guid></item><item><title>古代人类牙齿化石中的“牙签槽”毕竟可能不是来自牙签- Phys.org</title><link>https://phys.org/news/2025-10-toothpick-grooves-ancient-fossil-human.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;
										
&lt;p&gt;For decades, small grooves on ancient human teeth were thought to be evidence of deliberate tool use—people cleaning their teeth with sticks or fibers, or easing gum pain with makeshift "toothpicks." Some researchers even &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2020.102769" target="_blank"&gt;called it the oldest human habit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;But our new findings, published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.70132" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;American Journal of Biological Anthropology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, challenge this long-held idea about &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/human+evolution/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human evolution&lt;/a&gt;. We found these grooves also appear naturally in wild &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/primates/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;primates&lt;/a&gt;, with little support for tooth-picking as the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more striking, in more than 500 wild primates, across 27 species both living and fossil, we found no trace of a common modern dental disease: deep, V-shaped gumline notches called abfraction lesions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings can help reshape how we interpret the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/fossil+record/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fossil record&lt;/a&gt; and raise fresh questions about the uniquely human ways our teeth are affected today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why teeth matter in human evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teeth are the most durable part of the skeleton and often survive long after the rest of the body has decayed. Anthropologists rely on them to reconstruct ancient diets, lifestyles and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even tiny marks can carry important meaning. One recurring feature is the thin groove across exposed tooth roots, especially between teeth. &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27907646" target="_blank"&gt;Since the early 20th century&lt;/a&gt;, these have been labeled "toothpick grooves" and interpreted as signs of tool use or &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/dental+hygiene/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dental hygiene&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have been reported across our recent &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/evolutionary+history/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;evolutionary history&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0003-9969(00)00128-X" target="_blank"&gt;from 2-million-year-old fossils through to Neanderthals&lt;/a&gt;. But until now, no one had really checked whether other primates also have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different condition, abfraction, looks very different—deep wedge-shaped notches near the gumline. These are very common in modern dentistry and often linked to tooth grinding, forceful brushing, or acidic drinks. Their absence in the fossil record has long puzzled researchers. Do other primates really never suffer from them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;What we did&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test these assumptions, we analyzed more than 500 teeth from 27 &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/primate+species/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;primate species&lt;/a&gt;, both extinct and living. The sample included gorillas, orangutans, macaques, colobus monkeys, fossil apes and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, all specimens came from &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/wild+populations/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;wild populations&lt;/a&gt;, meaning their tooth wear could not have been influenced by toothbrushes, soft drinks or processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We looked for non-carious cervical lesions—a name for tissue loss at the tooth neck not caused by decay. Using microscopes, 3D scans and tissue-loss measurements, we documented even the smallest lesions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What we found&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 4% of individuals had lesions. Some looked almost identical to the classic "toothpick grooves" of fossil humans, complete with fine parallel scratches and tapering shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others were shallow and smooth, especially on front teeth, likely caused by acidic fruits that many primates consume in large amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one absence stood out. We found no abfraction lesions at all. Despite studying species with extremely tough diets and powerful chewing forces, not a single primate showed the wedge-shaped defects so &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/CCIDE.S63465" target="_blank"&gt;commonly seen in modern dental clinics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;What does this mean?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, grooves that resemble "toothpick" marks don't necessarily prove tool use. Natural chewing, abrasive foods, or even swallowed grit can produce similar patterns. In some cases, specialized behaviors like stripping vegetation with the teeth may also contribute. We therefore need to be cautious about interpreting every fossil groove as deliberate toothpicking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the complete absence of abfraction lesions in primates strongly suggests these are a uniquely human problem, tied to modern habits. They are far more likely caused by forceful brushing, acidic drinks and processed diets than by natural chewing forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This places abfraction alongside other dental issues, such as impacted wisdom teeth and misaligned teeth, which are rare in wild primates but common in humans today. Together, these insights are shaping a growing subfield known as evolutionary dentistry, using our evolutionary past to understand the dental problems of the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why it matters today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, grooves on fossil teeth may sound trivial. But they matter for both anthropology and dentistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For evolutionary science, they show why we must check our closest relatives before assuming a specific, or unique, cultural explanation. For modern health, they highlight how profoundly our diets and lifestyles alter our teeth in ways that set us apart from other primates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing human teeth with those of other primates, we can tease apart what's universal (the inevitable wear and tear of chewing) and what's uniquely human—the result of modern diets, behaviors and dental care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research will expand to larger primate samples, investigate diet-wear links in the wild, and apply advanced imaging to see how lesions form. The aim is to refine how we interpret the past while finding new ways on how to prevent dental disease today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What may look like a fossil human tooth-picking groove could just as easily be the by-product of everyday chewing. Equally, it might reflect other cultural or dietary behaviors that leave similar marks. To untangle these possibilities, we need much larger comparative datasets of lesions in wild primates, only then can we begin to trace broader patterns and refine our interpretations of the fossil record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the absence of abfraction lesions in primates suggests that some of our most common dental problems are uniquely human. It's a reminder that even in something as everyday as toothache, our evolutionary history is written in our teeth, but shaped as much by modern habits as by ancient biology.&lt;/p&gt;

While it primarily affects the liver, research shows it also has significant effects on overall health, particularly the heart. Individuals with fatty liver are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular problems such as atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and heart failure. Factors like chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and altered lipid metabolism link liver fat accumulation to heart health. Fatty liver disease can progress silently over years, often without obvious symptoms, but may lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and increased mortality if left unmanaged. Early detection, lifestyle changes, and medical management are essential to reduce risks and protect both liver and cardiovascular function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding fatty liver disease and its link with heart disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease occurs when excess fat accumulates in liver cells. In MASLD, this condition arises in individuals without significant alcohol consumption, often linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. The disease progresses through stages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Ways to check for fatty liver at home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple steatosis: Fat accumulation without inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH): Fat accumulation accompanied by inflammation and liver cell damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cirrhosis: Severe scarring of the liver tissue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Liver cancer: Development of malignant cells in the liver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early stages often present no symptoms, making early detection challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heart conditions caused by fatty liver disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging research indicates a robust association between fatty liver disease and various cardiovascular conditions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Atherosclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease contributes to the buildup of plaques in arteries, leading to narrowed and hardened arteries. This occurs because excess fat in the liver can increase systemic inflammation and promote the accumulation of cholesterol-rich deposits in blood vessels. Over time, these plaques reduce blood flow, increase blood pressure, and significantly raise the risk of stroke and heart attack.

The combination of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and chronic inflammation associated with fatty liver accelerates the progression of CAD. This can manifest as chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, or, in severe cases, a heart attack. A study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(25)00112-7/fulltext" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The Lancet Regional Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; – Europe highlights that metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a severe form of fatty liver disease, can lead to liver scarring (fibrosis), cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and liver cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Heart failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease may elevate the risk of heart failure, a condition where the heart cannot pump blood effectively to meet the body’s needs. Chronic metabolic stress from fatty liver can lead to structural and functional changes in the heart, including thickening of the heart walls (left ventricular hypertrophy) and reduced cardiac efficiency. People with fatty liver are also more likely to develop high blood pressure, further contributing to heart failure risk. Additionally, inflammation and insulin resistance associated with fatty liver can strain the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Arrhythmias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8238775/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nature Reviews Gastroenterology and Hepatology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; explores the risk of cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, highlighting the underlying mechanisms and clinical implications.

Systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and electrolyte imbalances associated with fatty liver can disrupt the electrical signaling of the heart. Arrhythmias can increase the risk of stroke, reduce cardiac efficiency, and, in severe cases, lead to sudden cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, cardiovascular disease has become the leading cause of death in individuals with fatty liver disease, surpassing liver-related complications &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mechanisms linking fatty liver to heart disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several mechanisms explain the connection between fatty liver disease and cardiovascular conditions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic inflammation in the liver can lead to systemic inflammation, affecting blood vessels and heart tissue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insulin resistance&lt;/strong&gt;: Fatty liver is often associated with insulin resistance, a precursor to type 2 diabetes, which is a significant risk factor for heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dyslipidemia:&lt;/strong&gt; Altered lipid metabolism in fatty liver disease leads to increased levels of harmful cholesterol and triglycerides, contributing to plaque formation in arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxidative stress:&lt;/strong&gt; Excess fat in the liver can produce reactive oxygen species, damaging blood vessels and heart tissue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These factors collectively increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases in individuals with fatty liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Importance of early detection and management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the asymptomatic nature of early-stage fatty liver disease, regular screening is crucial, especially for individuals with risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One dose, weeks of relief:&lt;/strong&gt; A single psilocybin injection reversed both chronic pain and depression-like symptoms in mice within 24 hours, with effects lasting at least 12 days.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain circuits, not injuries:&lt;/strong&gt; The pain relief came from calming overactive neurons in a mood-and-pain processing region of the brain, not from healing the actual injuries, which remained visible at the study’s end.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Psilocybin worked when it reached the brain’s anterior cingulate cortex but had no effect when injected near the spinal cord, showing pain relief happens in the brain.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gentle balance beats brute force:&lt;/strong&gt; Psilocybin’s partial activation of two serotonin receptors simultaneously proved more effective than fully activating either one alone or blocking pain signals entirely.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain and depression are intertwined:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice with worse pain consistently showed worse anxiety and depression, and psilocybin relieved both simultaneously by rebalancing the same brain circuits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHILADELPHIA —&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania found that a single treatment with psilocybin, the active compound in magic mushrooms, rapidly reversed both chronic pain and depression-like symptoms in mice. The relief lasted for at least 12 days, the duration of observation after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02068-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, confirms what doctors have long observed but struggled to treat: &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/chronic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t just hurt the body. It rewires the brain, creating psychological suffering that worsens the original pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chronic-pain-breaks-the-brain-s-thermostat"&gt;Chronic Pain Breaks the Brain’s Thermostat&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team created two types of lasting pain in mice during the four-week study. Some had nerve damage. Others had severe &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/inflammation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;  in their paws. Both groups became hypersensitive to touch and developed what looked like mouse versions of profound &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. They avoided open spaces, gave up faster in swimming tests, and showed impaired movement coordination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging revealed the culprit. A region called the anterior cingulate cortex, which processes both the emotional experience of pain and regulates mood, had essentially broken. Think of it like a smoke detector that won’t stop blaring even after the fire’s out. Nerve cells in this area were firing 40% more than they should have been, and they wouldn’t calm down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hitting-the-reset-switch"&gt;Hitting the Reset Switch&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On day 27, researchers gave mice a single &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/psilocybin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;injection of psilocybin&lt;/a&gt;. Within 24 hours, sensitivity to pain dropped to normal levels in both groups. The mice also returned to typical behavior in tests measuring anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The improvements lasted. Even 12 days after the single treatment (when the experiment ended), &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/pain-relief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pain relief&lt;/a&gt; continued and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt; remained stable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The location of psilocybin’s action mattered enormously. When researchers injected &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/how-magic-mushrooms-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;psilocin&lt;/a&gt; (what psilocybin becomes in the body) directly into the anterior cingulate cortex, they saw dramatic improvements. When they injected it into the spinal cord near the injury site, nothing changed. The activity levels that had been 40% above normal dropped back to baseline within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-it-worked"&gt;Why It Worked&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin affects two types of serotonin receptors in the brain: 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A. The researchers found it needs both to work its magic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers blocked either one before giving psilocybin, all benefits vanished. Pain returned, anxiety stayed high, depression-like behaviors persisted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But overstimulating those same receptors individually didn’t help either. Maxing out 5-HT2A receptors alone actually increased activity in already overactive circuits. Maxing out 5-HT1A receptors alone decreased activity but provided only modest pain relief and no mood benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only psilocybin’s partial activation of both receptors simultaneously restored normal &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/brain-activity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than blocking pain signals or dampening all brain activity, psilocybin &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/magic-mushrooms-rewire-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recalibrates specific circuits&lt;/a&gt; that chronic pain has knocked out of balance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pain-and-depression-a-two-way-street"&gt;Pain and Depression: A Two-Way Street&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study mapped how chronic pain and depression reinforce each other. Mice with either type of chronic pain showed nearly identical patterns: worse pain correlated with more depression and anxiety, measured across multiple behavioral tests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers examined individual animals, pain severity predicted &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/magic-mushrooms-treat-ptsd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;psychological distress&lt;/a&gt; consistently. Both male and female mice showed the same relationship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one experiment, mice could choose between two rooms: one where they’d received psilocybin before, and one where they’d gotten saltwater. They spent significantly more time in the psilocybin room. The researchers say this shows the mice associated that space with feeling better, not that they were seeking the drug itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pain relief didn’t come from healing the injury itself. When researchers examined nerve injury sites 40 days later, nerve tangles were still present. The pain reversal came entirely &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/magic-mushroom-brain-connections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;from changes in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-people"&gt;What This Means for People&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, while the study used mouse models, keep in mind that human chronic pain involves additional psychological and social complexity. The specific dose, delivery method, and treatment schedule would need extensive testing for human use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the 50 million &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/1-in-3-americans-constant-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Americans living with&lt;/a&gt; chronic pain, along with the large portion who also battle depression and anxiety, the research offers new understanding of how these conditions intertwine in the brain. If similar effects occur in humans, periodic treatment might someday become possible, but that remains unproven.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early human trials with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/psilocybin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;psilocybin&lt;/a&gt; for chronic pain are already underway, though these remain exploratory. Whether the dramatic effects seen in mice will translate to human patients is uncertain, but the neurobiological insights alone advance understanding of how &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/chronic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt; transforms the brain and why it resists treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers induced chronic pain in adult mice using two established models: spared nerve injury (surgical cutting of two of three sciatic nerve branches) and complete Freund’s adjuvant injection (large-volume inflammatory compound into the footpad). They measured mechanical sensitivity using electronic von Frey testing, which records the precise pressure at which mice withdraw their paws. Anxiety and depression-like behaviors were assessed through elevated plus maze, forced swim test, tail suspension test, open field test, and light/dark box testing. Two-photon calcium imaging in awake, head-fixed mice expressing GCaMP6f allowed real-time visualization of neuronal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. For drug experiments, researchers used systemic injections of psilocybin (0.5 mg/kg) as well as local applications of psilocin, serotonin receptor agonists, and antagonists. Sample sizes ranged from 5-30 mice per group depending on the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both pain models produced mechanical hypersensitivity lasting over 27 days, with withdrawal thresholds dropping to less than 50% of normal. Increased depression and anxiety-like behaviors coincided with the pain. A single dose of psilocybin on day 27 reversed mechanical allodynia within 24 hours, returning sensitivity to pre-injury levels, with effects persisting through day 40. Mood-related behaviors similarly normalized. Two-photon imaging revealed that chronic pain increased spontaneous neuronal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex by approximately 40%, and local psilocin application reduced the hyperactivity back to baseline within minutes. Bilateral psilocin injection to the anterior cingulate cortex replicated systemic psilocybin’s effects on both pain and mood, while spinal injection had no effect. Blocking either 5-HT2A or 5-HT1A receptors before psilocybin completely prevented therapeutic effects. Full agonism at these receptors individually or combined produced only partial benefits compared to psilocybin’s partial agonist activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted exclusively in rodent models, which may not fully capture the complex nature of human chronic pain. All pain models were induced acutely rather than developing naturally. The relatively short follow-up period (40 days) doesn’t address whether benefits would persist long-term or whether repeated dosing might be necessary. Sex-based analysis was preliminary, with some behavioral tests showing small sample sizes for detecting potential sex differences. The mechanism by which psilocybin induces lasting changes beyond its immediate effects remains unclear. The study didn’t examine potential adverse effects or safety concerns beyond basic behavioral observation. Local drug administration experiments required surgical procedures that might themselves influence pain processing.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Many pharmaceutical drugs come with an ominous list of risks, but the devil is in the details. How likely and dangerous are the side effects, and how do those hazards compare with whatever treatment the drug is meant to provide?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a new study, questions like those may not have received enough attention for one particular drug over the past two decades – and a similar lack of scrutiny may still be exposing patients to excessive dangers from other pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study focuses on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-discovery-hair-loss-drug-may-lower-risk-of-heart-disease"&gt;finasteride&lt;/a&gt;, a prescription drug taken by millions of men since the 1990s. It's commonly used to treat male pattern hair loss as well as benign prostatic hyperplasia, or non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/protein-that-calms-waking-hair-follicles-could-lead-to-alopecia-treatment"&gt;Protein That Calms Waking Hair Follicles Could Lead to Alopecia Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, however, there have been hints of finasteride's effects on mood, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.25nr15862"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; study author Mayer Brezis, a retired nephrologist and medical professor at the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite mounting evidence linking the drug with serious psychiatric side effects – including anxiety,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="176156" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and suicide – the manufacturers and the medical and regulatory communities have overlooked these findings to the detriment of public health, Brezis &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.25nr15862"&gt;concludes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The literature review encompasses eight studies published between 2017 and 2023 and incorporates data from multiple countries and data systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its findings suggest people who take finasteride face a significantly higher risk of mood disorders and suicidal thoughts than those who don't take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The evidence is no longer anecdotal," Brezis &lt;a href="https://international.huji.ac.il/news/why-are-we-still-ignoring-suicide-risk-hair-loss-drug"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "We now see consistent patterns across diverse populations. And the consequences may have been tragic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) listed depression as a potential side effect of finasteride &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2011/020788Orig1s017.pdf"&gt;in 2011&lt;/a&gt;, and added &lt;a href="https://www.hsa.gov.sg/announcements/safety-alert/finasteride-and-potential-risk-of-suicidal-ideation"&gt;suicidality in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, although researchers had raised concerns &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1346-8138.2002.tb00200.x"&gt;as early as 2002&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a trial related to the suicide of one finasteride user, Brezis reports, internal FDA documents revealed the agency's experts had recommended adding "suicidal thoughts and behavior" to the warning label in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The advice was rejected by the agency without disclosing the internal discussion and the rationale for the final decision," Brezis &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.25nr15862"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;. He cites sections of FDA documents that were concealed as confidential, including estimates of the number of people that might be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Transparency is crucial when facing inherent conflicts between innovation and safety, progress and public health," Brezis &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.25nr15862"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA had recorded only 18 suicides associated with finasteride by 2011, yet based on global usage of the drug, the new study suggests the total could be in the thousands. Rather than mere underreporting, Brezis &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.25nr15862"&gt;attributes this&lt;/a&gt; to "a systemic failure of pharmacovigilance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Brezis, this includes failures by the drug's original manufacturer, Merck, to conduct simple safety research using database analyses, as well as regulators neglecting to request such research from the manufacturer or to conduct it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Merck &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reuters.com/article/business/exclusive-merck-anti-baldness-drug-propecia-has-long-trail-of-suicide-reports-idUSKBN2A40GV/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=docs&amp;amp;ust=1759722693098814&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2xlEhPJ_HOgYaNeuTUN4AU"&gt;told Reuters&lt;/a&gt;: "The scientific evidence does not support a causal link between Propecia [a brand name for finasteride] and suicide or suicidal ideation and these terms should not be included in the labeling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Merck works continuously with regulators to ensure that potential safety signals are carefully analyzed and, if appropriate, included in the label for Propecia," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the studies in the latest review had been initiated by Merck or by regulators, with a &lt;span&gt;lack of regulatory scrutiny potentially due in part to the drug's classification as cosmetic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finasteride's efficacy against hair loss arises from its interference with the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), although the drug also inhibits the production of certain neurosteroids, such as allopregnanolone, linked to mood regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.09.021"&gt;research on non-human animals&lt;/a&gt;, finasteride has been associated with long-term effects on brain inflammation and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-1249095"&gt;structural changes&lt;/a&gt; in the hippocampus, a brain structure involved with learning, memory, and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if patients stop taking the drug, psychiatric side effects could continue for months or years in a condition known as "post-finasteride syndrome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp068246"&gt;explained how financial interests&lt;/a&gt; can override concerns over drug safety, which is what Brezis suspects happened with finasteride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This apparent failure of pharmacovigilance falls on regulators as well as manufacturers, and the study outlines some takeaways for all parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brezis concludes that medications like finasteride should not be approved unless researchers can clearly establish their safety. Even after a drug like this is approved, he adds, ongoing safety research should be legally required to ensure the approval is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The lesson is that before approving a medication for the market, regulators should require manufacturers to commit to performing and disclosing ongoing post-approval analytical studies, and this requirement needs to be enforced," Brezis &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.09.021"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/analytical-review-depression-suicidality-finasteride/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If this story has raised concerns or you need to talk to someone, &lt;a href="http://www.suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html"&gt;please consult this list to find a 24/7 crisis hotline in your country, and reach out for help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                Dr. Tsion Firew at her home in Kigali, Rwanda, on Oct. 3. A year ago, Rwanda announced the country's first Marburg outbreak — a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda, was afraid for herself and her kids. She sent them away, updated her life insurance — and helped quash the outbreak.&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Tsion Firew had just finished running a first aid training when she glanced down at her phone — and then looked up confused.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The message she saw was about a colleague Firew had worked with a few days earlier in the emergency department at King Faisal Hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. "She's very young, full of energy, one of the smartest nurses I've ever worked with," recalls Firew, who is chair of emergency medicine at Africa Health Sciences University in Rwanda.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The message simply said: "Pray for her."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Firew rejiggered her schedule and made a trip to the intensive care unit. As Firew peeked around the screen that divided the patients, she saw the young energetic nurse and was taken aback. The woman was almost "lifeless." Eyes barely open. Not recognizing familiar faces.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It was quite scary, because you had no idea what you were dealing with," Firew says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Soon it became clear.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This was one of those moments where the job of a health care worker can quickly go from risky to deadly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On September 27, 2024 Rwanda announced the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5133987/marburg-virus-rwanda-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;country's first Marburg outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a deadly virus that's a cousin to Ebola. For Firew, it was the beginning of a harrowing journey. She sent her 1- and 3-year-old children to another country. She faced pressure from her family to stop working as an emergency room doctor for her own safety. And she hallucinated from sheer exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Now, a year later, the basics of &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2415816" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Rwanda are known. It most likely started with a 27-year-old miner who caught the virus from a bat in a rural mining tunnel. It ended on December 20, 2024 and had garnered &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/11/01/g-s1-30948/virus-marburg-outbreak-rwanda-unprecedented-success" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;international renown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a model for a successful outbreak response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Marburg is notorious for its high death rate, sometimes killing almost &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;9 out of every 10 patients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But the small country in east-central Africa achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded in an outbreak: 23%. Only 15 of the 66 Marburg patients died. Of all the Marburg patients in Rwanda, more than three-quarters were health care workers, many were Firew's friends and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Firew says the experience has taught her to hone the skill of compartmentalizing — tucking away the Marburg memories so she can continue her work as a physician and mother. But, on this anniversary, she's letting herself relive those first few days and weeks of the outbreak. And she's reflecting on the state of the world today and why it needs the lessons learned from the Marburg outbreak more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"This is real"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After seeing her colleague, Firew stepped into the hallway and moved to a discreet corner. "I was overcome with emotion — crying," says Firew, who has been practicing medicine for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A colleague saw her. "He consoled me. He hugged me," Firew recalls.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She went home to put her kids to bed. They read and prayed for the colleague's "ouchie." Then another text arrived — from the colleague who'd comforted her: "I've developed a fever. I'm in an isolation unit."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Soon another message lit up her phone: The young nurse had died, leaving behind her partner and a toddler.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's when I was like: Oh God. This is — this is real," Firew says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her mind was racing. She knew that Marburg was deadly, that it had &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/marburg/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;no approved treatment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that it was very contagious, spreading through bodily fluid — even sweat. Closing her eyes, she replayed that hug in the ICU hallway. What if she'd been exposed to Marburg?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was just extremely scary," she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Half her mind was working on her emergency department's strategy for such a deadly disease. The other half was preoccupied with an urgent question: What should she do about her children?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Telling a 1-year-old and a 3-year-old: 'Stay in a corner. Don't touch me!' was not going to fly," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And her husband wasn't able to help. He was stuck in the U.S. An engineering consultant, he'd gone there for work&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and dropped by his parents in Atlanta for a quick visit. Then came Hurricane Helene. "He couldn't even get out of his parents' house because there were trees everywhere," Firew says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She realized she had no choice but to send her kids away. They flew to Ethiopia, where her parents live, accompanied by an adult cousin and nanny.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;All the while her phone was dinging with messages from colleagues who were developing symptoms. "They would go isolate. They'd test positive," she says. "And then, especially in the first three, four days, most of them died."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Mommy, I need you"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Firew had decided not to tell her parents about the Marburg outbreak. She didn't want to scare them. Instead, she said something vague about sending the kids for an Ethiopian holiday. But the day after the kids arrived, her parents called. It was about Firew's 3-year-old: He'd developed a fever.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Of course, I freak out," Firew says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Could she have infected her son? The young boy gets on the phone, Firew remembers his words: " 'Mommy, I need you now. Where are you? Why are you not with me?' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For a moment, Firew says, she let her emotions clouded her judgement. She bought a ticket to Ethiopia. Then she canceled it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The grandparents took him to the hospital and Firew went to her own hospital, where Rwandan health officials had already set up Marburg testing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She got tested and, since she didn't have any concerning symptoms, she went to work. She put on full protective gear — stretching it here and swimming in it there since it was not designed for female bodies. Soon she was caring for Marburg patients, including the colleague who'd given her the hug in the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He was on the verge of dying," she recalls. "The course of the disease, for me, was extremely shocking. I called it the kiss of death. There's bleeding from the mouth, and other orifices" — their gums, their nose.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Hearing voices"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The fear followed Firew home that night, where she called up a good friend, Dr. Craig Spencer, who'd lived through Ebola and was himself infected. She remembers telling him, "I can't think clearly right now. My colleagues are dying every day. Could I be next?"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Spencer urged her to think through the practical steps. So Firew upped her life insurance policy. Asking herself: If I die, how much will my family realistically need?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After five days, Firew had hardly slept. Alone and exhausted in her empty house, she says, she started hallucinating. "I was hearing voices. It was voices of my colleagues," she says. "Right when I'm about to doze off, they'd wake me up."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The most vivid voice is that of her colleague who'd given her that hug. She hears him calling her name, repeatedly. She hears the beeping of the hospital machines that are working to save him.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was just a complete nightmare — I mean, that's an understatement," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, the next day, she got up and went into the hospital where she was running the clinic and had a long list of patients. She went despite the fact that relatives, who'd seen what was happening on the news, begged her not to go. They urged her to leave it all behind for the sake of her kids, her family.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-91491" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"No Marburg deniers"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Firew was adamant. She could not leave. Her test had come back negative. She did not have Marburg and neither, it turns out, did her son. He had tonsillitis and would be fine. She had to keep doing her part, she told them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Part of what made her so resolute was the contrast she felt between this outbreak and her experience as a doctor in New York City during the height of COVID. That time, she says, she felt like the U.S. government was sometimes working at cross purposes with the medical community. This time, she felt, the Rwandan government was working hard to do things right.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It had set up testing and isolation wards right away. It started a clinical trial for a Marburg vaccine within 10 days of declaring an outbreak. And there were plenty of gloves and protective gowns.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"They were no Marburg deniers. There were a lot of COVID deniers," she recalls thinking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Firew had an idea to do something never before tried for Marburg: Start people who'd been exposed to the virus on an experimental treatment — remdesivir — even before they had symptoms. Remdesivir is a drug Firew used often when she was a physician in New York during COVID. She knew it was safe and was being used experimentally for Marburg in non-human primates. But why not start it prophylactically, in the hopes it could guard against the disease or lessen the virus's impact when it strikes?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The idea was bought on that Tuesday. It was started on that Wednesday, and we gave it to over 150 health care workers that had high risk exposures," she recalls, saying the research on the impact is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her colleague, the one from the hallway, is among those who came back from the brink. In another experimental procedure run by the World Health Organization and others, Firew and colleagues gave him the first ever infusion of monoclonal antibodies for a Marburg patient. That monoclonal antibody — which was given to others too — was designed to bind to the Marburg virus and neutralize it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Just to be part of this extraordinary response is such a big — I guess I'll say, a big opportunity," Firew says. She says she the initial fear she felt is now tempered by feelings of pride for the work she did and gratitude for the colleagues she worked alongside and the family members that supported her. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, as Firew looks at the news, she says her memories of Marburg have resurfaced. Watching as scientific facts questioned and public health approaches upended in the U.S., she says, she wishes the world could see Rwanda's response as proof of what a deep belief in science can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The discussions about public health can be so discouraging," she says. "But I look back and see: This work, this effort did not go to waste. It is not futile."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She still thinks about whether she could have saved just one more life. But she also thinks about a moment six weeks after the outbreak started, when she and her husband decided it was finally safe for him and the kids to return home to Rwanda.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-91499" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Tsion Firew was finally reunited with her family at the airport in Kigali after being apart for six weeks. Firew says she hugged her 3-year-old son from the arrivals area all the way to the parking lot. "In crisis, we often ask, 'Why me?' But perhaps the better question is: 'What now?'" says Firew.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"My three-year-old, he ran across the airport when he saw me and it was like this prolonged hug — he just did not want to let go of me," she recalls through tears. "It was a feeling that I've never had before."&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, she was given 'devastating' news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After giving her an injection to try and stop her post-birth bleeding, doctors were still unable to prevent Danika from hemorrhaging and ordered her a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within 30 minutes, the results revealed that Danika had acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a rare and aggressive form of blood cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, around 22,000 people are diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) each year, and it is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults, characterized by its rapid progression over the course of a few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it's uncommon in people under the age of 45. The average age of people when they are first diagnosed with AML is about 69, and it is uncommon in people under the age of 45. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hilmer's case was highly unusual as she was just 32 at the time of her diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After doctors discovered the leukemia in her blood, the new mom had her newborn taken from her arms and was rushed to another hospital to start chemotherapy treatment immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Anika Hilmer, 34, in the hospital with her newborn son Banks Mohwinkle and older sons Beckett, 13, and Perry, 8. Hours later, she discovered she had a rare cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After doctors discovered the leukemia in her blood, the new mom had her newborn taken from her arms and was rushed to another hospital to start chemotherapy treatment immediately&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hilmer stayed in the hospital for a month, leaving her then fiancé to care for their tiny son and the other two children, until she was able to return home a few days before &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/thanksgiving/index.html" id="mol-37ac3140-a068-11f0-8797-d139455908ff" class=""&gt;Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The stay-at-home mom underwent two further rounds of chemotherapy followed by a successful stem cell transplant in January 2023 and has been in remission since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hilmer says giving birth that day 'saved her life' and fears what stage the cancer would have been detected at if the blood test had been carried out any later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The time course of AML progression can vary, but it typically progresses within weeks to months, with the number of abnormal cells in the blood increasing quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike solid tumors, AML doesn't use a traditional stage numbering system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of AML, such as fatigue, weakness, unintentional weight loss, and night sweats, are often missed as they are vague and can be mistaken for common illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the disease progresses, they can become more apparent, with easy bruising, bone pain, frequent infections, and significant enlargement of the spleen or liver, raising concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The five-year survival rate is around 30 percent. Hilmer says she experienced no unusual symptoms during her pregnancy other than sciatica, a pain, numbness, or tingling that starts in the lower back or buttocks and radiates down the leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She believes that if it weren't for her pregnancy, she might not have caught the cancer in time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hilmer said: 'This pregnancy absolutely saved my life. I went to the hospital that morning fully anticipating just having a baby, and that was it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'After I had him, I was haemorrhaging so I was losing a lot of blood, and the doctors and nurses were unable to get it to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They tried to give me a shot at one point to stop the bleeding, but it didn't work.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bleeding after pregnancy is normal and called lochia, but excessive bleeding, large clots, or foul odor may signal a complication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hilmer continued bleeding for around an hour after giving birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point, the doctors considered sending her for a hysterectomy to stop it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But before opting for the procedure, the doctor who performed the delivery decided to order blood work to see if that could reveal what was behind the excessive bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the US, around 22,000 people are diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) each year and it is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults, characterized by its rapid progression over the course of a few weeks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hilmer says giving birth that day 'saved her life' and fears what stage the cancer would have been detected at if the blood test had been carried out any later&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unexpectedly, the doctor returned and explained to Hilmer that she had AML. Topping things off, she also found out she had Covid, so she had to be cared for in an isolation room, treated with medical staff wearing layers of personal protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled: 'They ended up taking a blood sample, and it only took 30 minutes for it to come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The doctor came back into the room to tell me that the results showed that I had acute myeloid leukemia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My fiancé and I were both in shock. My baby was taken out of my arms, and I was rushed away to a different hospital where I had to start chemotherapy right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am very thankful that the doctor decided to do blood work instead of that surgery because I probably wouldn't be here today. My platelet counts were so low that I would not have been able to stop bleeding.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Platelets help blood clot, making them essential for stopping bleeding and healing wounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because she had no symptoms, the mother-of-three said the diagnosis came as a complete 'shock'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I kept thinking that when I got to the other hospital, they would tell me it was wrong, but when I got there, they confirmed that it was true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I spent the next month in hospital, going through chemo, and it was very depressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was hormonal because I'd just had a baby that I could not be with and was only allowed a couple of visits from my newborn, as well as my other two children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was isolating. I was not doing very well mentally at that time because it was all so much.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hilmer, pictured here, says she experienced no unusual symptoms during her pregnancy other than sciatica, a pain, numbness, or tingling that starts in the lower back or buttock and radiates down the leg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hilmer, pictured with her partner and their three children, hopes sharing her story will highlight the importance of preventive health care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After undergoing a stem cell transplant, Hilmer said it took another year before she had her strength and energy back and felt like herself again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A stem cell transplant allows doctors to give higher doses of chemotherapy than normally could be given. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The process involves high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate leukemia cells and stem cells, followed by the infusion of healthy donor stem cells, which can then target and destroy remaining cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The blood-forming stem cells used for a transplant can come either from blood or from bone marrow.

However, this June, she found out she&lt;span&gt; has Stage 1 invasive ductal carcinoma breast cancer, and she underwent a double mastectomy to treat it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Invasive ductal carcinoma, also known as infiltrating ductal carcinoma or IDC, is the most common form of breast cancer, accounting for 80 percent of all breast cancer diagnoses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It occurs when abnormal cells growing in the lining of the milk ducts change and invade breast tissue beyond the walls of the duct.

It also evaluated genetic data of more than 45,000 patients with the condition from diverse cohorts in Europe and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;By linking genetic information to age at diagnosis, the researchers observed that the profiles of those identified early with the condition differed from those who received confirmation at later stages. They found only a slight overlap between the two groups, indicating that the biological mechanisms associated with autism in childhood may be different from those linked to autism identified in adolescence or adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The analysis, published last week in the journal Nature, showed that children diagnosed before the age of 6 were more likely to have behavioral difficulties—such as problems with social interaction—from an early age. In contrast, those diagnosed after the age of 10 were more likely to experience social and behavioral difficulties during adolescence. They also had a greater predisposition to mental health conditions, such as depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The study adds that the average genetic profile of those diagnosed later was closer to that of &lt;a href="https://es.wired.com/articulos/los-diagnosticos-de-tdah-estan-aumentando-en-ninos-y-adolescentes-revela-un-nuevo-informe"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; and conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder than to that of “classic” autism identified in early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The study concludes that the timing of diagnosis is not entirely random but reflects underlying genetic differences that, in some cases, coincide with risk for other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“For the first time, we have found that earlier and later diagnosed autism have different underlying biological and developmental profiles,” said Varun Warrier, a researcher in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the paper, in a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/study-reveals-genetic-and-developmental-differences-in-people-with-earlier-versus-later-autism" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/study-reveals-genetic-and-developmental-differences-in-people-with-earlier-versus-later-autism"}' href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/study-reveals-genetic-and-developmental-differences-in-people-with-earlier-versus-later-autism" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. “The term ‘autism’ likely describes multiple conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOYXJLZFN6Wm1USzhpNFUtbkY3aS1oZVBhdVpwR0cxX0lVMTlLSDNzckFtelN0dTU4Yk9BNW14Y0FMYWFGaGZwTkZERkd5ZG9wV3JYdkROM0hMWEVkYzE2UmR6Z3A4em1acVREdEhNa0ZBTEM0anpFaVZZY0VzTTZHRzNVSmh1Z2lna0xydkkzbXZFM25RM0ZXQmpDRkZUclJqVExuaFdtQTY</guid></item><item><title>四种有助于预防痴呆的常规疫苗-《每日电讯报》</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/dementia/four-vaccines-help-prevent-dementia/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why do vaccines have such a potent effect on brain health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;1. They prevent infections that raise your risk of dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some viruses, such as the varicella-zoster virus which causes shingles, can lie dormant in your central nervous system for decades, causing inflammation and having an impact on brain cells. According to the Alzheimer’s Society, other infections that have been linked to dementia include pneumonia, syphilis, Lyme disease and gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a growing body of evidence showing that viruses that hibernate in your nervous system for much of your life may be implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases,” says Pascal Geldsetzer, the Stanford epidemiologist who has carried out shingles vaccine research. “The varicella-zoster virus is in a constant interplay with the immune system throughout life, causing inflammation in the nervous system. Reducing this through shingles vaccination may well have a dementia-protecting effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that some viruses may directly attack the brain. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10090407/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have even&lt;/a&gt; indicated that some flu strains are capable of inducing the loss of brain cells and leading to neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would explain why vaccines which block these pathogens are protective against dementia, but researchers don’t believe it’s the full story. First, they think it’s highly unlikely that such a wide range of pathogens are all causing dementia, while some of the vaccines have only been around for a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With Alzheimer’s, for example, we think it takes two decades to go from the first development of plaques and tangles to enough cell death for dementia symptoms to appear,” says Rudolph Tanzi, a neurology professor at Harvard Medical School. “So if an infection is the root cause, new vaccines that have just been around for a few years shouldn’t be associated with protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;2. Vaccines also boost the brain’s immunity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Tanzi explains that every time you get a vaccine it ramps up the body’s wider immune response – known as the peripheral immune response. This leads to white blood cells infiltrating the brain and cleansing it of the toxic plaques which drive Alzheimer’s disease in particular. “When these cells get into the brain, they can efficiently clear amyloid plaques,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study used genetically engineered mice and put them in an Alzheimer’s-like disease state so that they developed plaques in their brains. When researchers experimented further on the mice to ramp up their peripheral immune response, they saw that the white blood cells moved into the brain and began “chewing up” plaques, as Prof Tanzi puts it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I believe is that if you’ve had even just a few vaccines, you’re lowering your amyloid plaque load,” he says. “You’re blowing out the masses that are going to cause this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Should you ask for the latest vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the Covid-19 vaccines, most vaccines are regularly updated and improved. A good example is the flu vaccine, which is updated every year as the virus mutates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One particularly intriguing discovery has been Harrison’s finding that the newer Shingrix vaccine appears to offer more dementia protection than the older Zostavax shingles vaccine. He believes this could be because Shingrix contains an adjuvant – a substance added to a vaccine to enhance the immune response, particularly in older individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The question is whether it’s more effective because it’s a better shingles vaccine and so better at suppressing the virus, or is it because it has this adjuvant which the older vaccine didn’t have?” says Harrison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Tanzi’s belief is that all vaccines containing adjuvants are likely to be more effective in preventing dementia because they ramp up the immune response to a greater extent. “The greater the immune activation, the more amyloid you’re going to clear and provide protection for the future,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you can get the latest vaccine depends on the condition it is targeting. For example, if you have already been vaccinated with the Zostavax shingles vaccine, the NHS says you are not eligible for the Shingrix vaccine. However, you should ensure you are up-to-date with the latest flu vaccine each year so that it effectively protects against the virus, and ask your GP about the RSV vaccine programme that was launched last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why it’s so important to stay on top of your vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all this is correct, it could point towards new treatments for Alzheimer’s in particular. Rather than spending thousands on expensive treatments to clear out plaque in our brains, we could simply stimulate the immune system to do this for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also implies that many of us could benefit from our immune system’s natural abilities to cleanse our brain, simply by taking our freely available mid and later-life vaccines. Some of the recent studies have indicated that women, in particular, experience greater dementia protection after taking their vaccines, for reasons which are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women are at greater risk of Alzheimer’s, certainly, and for a long time it was thought that’s because they live longer,” says Paresh Malhotra, a neurology professor at Imperial College London and a trustee of the Alzheimer’s Society. “But it doesn’t look like it’s that alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the evidence grows that vaccines can protect the brain in later life, there is also an argument that we should perhaps start having them sooner, maybe even as early as our 40s and 50s. Malhotra says that while the shingles vaccine is currently available to 70 to 79-year-olds and those turning 65 on or after September 1 2023 on the NHS, the Government is planning to make it available to all over-60s within the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the NHS we’re all offered the shingles vaccine when we reach 70, but the uptake so far, I believe, has been less than 40 per cent,” says Harrison. “At the very least, I think, this recent data provides another reason to have the vaccine when you’re offered it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Tanzi, who has recently turned 67, believes there is a good argument that to protect our brains in mid and later life we should get ourselves vaccinated whenever the chance arises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This past year, I got a Covid booster, RSV, pneumonia [the pneumococcal vaccine], and I’m getting flu next week,” he says. “I look at that as four different clean-ups.”&lt;/p&gt;

The water running down the drain is a deep red. How you interpret this scene depends on its setting, and your history. If the person is in a gas station bathroom, and you just saw the latest true-crime series, these are the ablutions of a serial killer. If the person is at a kitchen sink, then perhaps they cut themselves while preparing a meal. If the person is in an art studio, you might find resonance with the struggle to get paint off your hands. If you are naive to crime story tropes, cooking or painting, you would have a different interpretation. If you are present, watching someone wash deep red off their hands into a sink, your response depends on even more variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How we act in the world is also specific to our species; we all live in an ‘umwelt’, or self-centred world, in the words of the philosopher-biologist Jakob von Uexküll (1864-1944). It’s not as simple as just taking in all the sensory information and then making a decision. First, our particular eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin already filter what we can see, hear, smell, taste and feel. We don’t take in everything. We don’t see ultraviolet light &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-urbanisation-can-be-a-friend-to-the-biodiversity-of-birds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;like a bird&lt;/a&gt;, we don’t hear infrasound &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-we-should-tune-into-the-orchestra-of-the-animal-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;like elephants&lt;/a&gt; and baleen whales do. Second, the size and shape of our bodies determine what possible actions we can take. Parkour athletes – those who run, vault, climb and jump in complex urban environments – are remarkable in their skills and daring, but sustain injuries that a cat doing the exact same thing would not. Every animal comes with a unique bag of tricks to exploit their environment; these tricks are also limitations under different conditions. Third, the world, our environment, changes. Seasons change, what animals can eat therefore also changes. If it’s the rainy season, grass will be abundant. The amount of grass determines who is around to eat it and therefore who is around to eat the grass-eaters. Ultimately, the challenge for each of us animals is how to act in this unstable world that we do not fully apprehend with our senses and our body’s limited degrees of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a fourth constraint, one that isn’t typically recognised. Most of the time, our intuition tells us that what we are seeing (or hearing or feeling) is an accurate representation of what is out there, and that anyone else would see (or hear or feel) it the same way. But we all know that’s not true and yet are continually surprised by it. It is even more fundamental than that: you know that seemingly basic sensory information that we are able to take in with our eyes and ears? It’s inaccurate. How we perceive elementary colours, ‘red’ for example, always depends on the amount of light, surrounding colours and other factors. In low lighting, the deep red washing down the sink might appear black. A yellow sink will make it look more orange; a blue sink may make it look violet. If, instead of through human eyeballs, we measured the wavelengths of light coming off the scene with a device called a spectrophotometer, then the wavelength of the light reflected off that ‘blood’ would be the same, no matter the surrounding colours. But our eyes don’t see the world as it really is because our eyes don’t measure wavelengths like a spectrophotometer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dale Purves, the George B Geller Professor of Neurobiology (Emeritus) at Duke University in North Carolina, thinks that, because we can never really see the world accurately, the brain’s primary purpose is to help us make associations to guide our behaviour in a way that, literally, makes sense. Purves sees ‘making sense’ as an active process where the brain produces inferences, of which we are not consciously aware, based on past experiences, to interpret and construct a coherent picture of our surroundings. Our brains use learned patterns and expectations to compensate for our imperfect senses and finite experiences, to give us the best understanding of the world &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;it can.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;P&lt;/span&gt;urves is the scientist’s scientist. He pursues the questions he’s genuinely interested in and does so with original approaches and ideas. Over the years, he’s changed the subject of his research multiple times, all with the intent of understanding how the brain works, tackling subjects that were new and unfamiliar to him, as opposed to chasing trends and techniques or sticking to a tried-and-true research path. His career is an instance of the claim &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/in-times-of-crisis-the-arts-are-weapons-for-the-soul" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Viktor Frankl&lt;/a&gt; makes in &lt;em&gt;Man’s Search for Meaning&lt;/em&gt; (1946): ‘For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself …’ If success is measured by accolades, then it did indeed follow Purves’s pursuits. Among a laundry list of awards and honours, he’s one of the few scientists elected both to the National Academy of Sciences (1989) and to what is now the National Academy of Medicine (1996). Election to either is considered to be among the highest honours that can be bestowed on a scientist in the United States. Nevertheless, if the name ‘Dale Purves’ sounds familiar to you, it is likely because you took a neuroscience course in college, for which the textbook was &lt;em&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; by Purves et al (one of the most popular and &lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/neuroscience-9780197616246?cc=gb&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt; in its &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;7th edition).&lt;/span&gt; Indeed, this is the text I used when I taught an introductory neuroscience course at Princeton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, Purves’s passion for neuroscience took time and experience to materialise. As an undergraduate at Yale, he struggled initially but found a major – philosophy – intending to pursue medicine. Purves developed an interest in science but didn’t know anything about being a scientist, and medicine seemed close enough. In 1960, he entered Harvard Medical School thinking he would become a psychiatrist. In his first year, he took a course on the nervous system, taught by young hotshot neuroscientists, some of whom would go on to be among the greats of the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;20th century&lt;/span&gt; (and whose work is now textbook material): David Potter, Ed Furshpan, David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel (the latter two won the Nobel Prize in 1981, along with Roger Sperry). Purves finished his medical degree in 1964, but he had grown disillusioned with psychiatry. He’d tried switching to general surgery, but realised he lacked the intensity of interest in surgery required to excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was 1965, and the Vietnam War gave him time to think. Purves was drafted but, as a physician, could serve his time as a Peace Corps employee, which he did in Venezuela. There, he said, he came across a book, &lt;em&gt;The Machinery of the Brain&lt;/em&gt; (1963) by Dean Wooldridge, that synthesised what he learned years ago in that first-year course on the nervous system. The book was written for the lay reader and shared the current knowledge about the brains of humans and other animals. Its particular angle was to compare the brain to the computer technology of the time. The book reignited Purves’s interest in the brain, which was first piqued in his medical school course. When he returned to the US, Purves would begin again as a researcher in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;There were more neurons in the developing embryo than there would be in the adult chicken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was an undergraduate at the University of Idaho when I first read Purves’s work. It was the early 1990s and I was a philosophy major like Purves but was really interested in neuroscience. So I sought hands-on research experience in a professor’s lab in the biology department. We were studying the immune-system markers of motor neurons in the rat’s spinal cord, the ones that connect to leg muscles causing them to contract. Mark DeSantis, my advisor, suggested a book by Purves. At the time, there were few courses or serious books on the brain. Purves’s &lt;em&gt;Body and Brain: A Trophic Theory of Neural Connections&lt;/em&gt; (1988) was perfect, just what I needed. Its central thesis is that the survival of neurons making connections, and the &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; of these connections, is regulated by the targets of those neuronal connections. In essence, he was telling us that, unlike the static circuit board of a computer, which is carefully designed and built according to a plan, the circuits of the nervous system are constructed on the fly in accordance with signals it receives from the targets of its connections. Those targets could be other neurons, organs or muscles in the body. As a result, as the body changes over the course of development in an individual or in the evolution of species, the neural circuits will adjust accordingly. Why is this important? Purves showed us that the brain is more than just a controller of the body: it is also an organ system that is embedded in a &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;dynamic relationship&lt;/a&gt; with the rest of the body, affected by body size, shape and activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Purves’s favourite examples to illustrate what sparked this theory is from the work of one of his scientific heroes, Viktor Hamburger. Hamburger had been studying central nervous system development in the 1930s, first at the University of Chicago, then as a faculty member at Washington University in &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;St Louis.&lt;/span&gt; Using chicken embryos and those spinal cord motor neurons, Hamburger &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.1400680305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that there were more neurons in the developing embryo than there would be in the adult chicken. How could that be? Why were there more neurons in an embryo than actually needed and why did some die off? Hamburger’s idea was that the muscles targeted by those neurons supplied a limited amount of trophic, or nutrient, factors. In essence, the target muscles were producing a ‘food’ (we now call it ‘nerve growth factor’) that kept the neuron alive. The size of the target determined how much food was available and therefore how many neuron lives it could sustain. Exploiting the ease with which chick embryos could be manipulated, Hamburger showed this by first amputating one of the wing buds (ie, the nascent wing). When he did so, the final number of motor neurons on the amputated side was lower than typical, with fewer on the ‘control’ side of the spinal cord. So, the limb bud was important for the survival of neurons. If that was true, then more of this ‘target tissue’ should save more neurons. Was it possible to ‘rescue’ those extra neurons that would normally die off? To answer this question, Hamburger surgically attached an extra limb bud on one side of the embryo, thereby artificially creating more target tissue. The result: more motor neurons survived on that side of the spinal cord. In both experiments, the size of the connection target – the body, those limb buds specifically – determined the number of neurons that survived. Purves ran with this idea of a dialogic relationship between body and brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;round four decades later, in the 1970s and ’80s, and Purves was now a young faculty colleague of Hamburger, his elder statesman at Washington University. Here, he took Hamburger’s theory about neuron-to-muscle connections and applied it to neuron-to-neuron connections. While he also looked at neuronal cell survival like Hamburger did, Purves also investigated the elimination and elaboration of individual connections that neurons make, their &lt;em&gt;synapses&lt;/em&gt;. This was a big leap because Purves was now testing whether or not Hamburger’s findings about death and survival of neurons in the chick embryo were peculiar to that species’ neuron-to-muscle relationship. Was the same process apparent in other developing circuits in other animals? And, if so, if a neuron survives, then are the number of connections (those synapses) also subject to competition for trophic factors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurons come in all shapes and sizes, with different degrees of complexity. If you’ve seen a typical picture of a single neuron then you know it looks like a tree or bush, with a set of root-like branches on one end and a single, long limb-like branch on the other. The latter can branch as well, depending on circumstances. One of those sets of branches – the dendrites – receives inputs from other neurons, and the other – the axon – sends outputs to other neurons. Together with his graduate student Jeff Lichtman, Purves wanted to know how synapse numbers change with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7414326/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;development&lt;/a&gt; and across different &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3983631/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt; of animals. Purves and Lichtman started with a simple neuron-to-neuron connection, where the receiving neuron had zero dendrites and the sending neuron’s axons made synapses directly on the receiving neuron’s cell body. To see this, they would surgically remove a tight group of functionally similar neurons, known as a ‘ganglion’, from different animals. They would then carefully fill a few individual neurons with a special enzyme. When this enzyme is then given a chemical to react with, it produces a colour. This colouring allows the neuron to be visualised under a microscope in its full glory – all their branches can be seen and counted. (Imagine a microscopic glass-blown tentacled creature being filled with ink and then counting its appendages.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The brain and body constitute a single, coherent and dynamic network; there is no way to separate them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of each branch represents a synaptic connection. Comparing connections in developing rats versus adults, they found that neurons initially received a few synapses from a number of different neurons. In a sense, the circuits were tangled up in young rats. By the time the rats were adults, each neuron had many synapses but only from one neuron – the circuit was untangled. How did this happen? Akin to the process of eliminating extra neurons based on target size, there was a process of elimination of superfluous connections from some neurons. Then there was an additional process of multiplication (or elaboration) of connections coming from the ‘correct’ (so to speak) neuron. In essence, once neurons could find the right partners by getting rid of the less desirable ones, their relationship could blossom in the form of additional synapses. Purves and Lichtman then replicated this basic finding with increasingly complex sets of neurons and in other species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get lost in the weeds, here’s the bottom line: trophic interactions between neurons match the number of neurons to the target size, and these interactions also regulate how many synapses they make. The grander theory is this: each class of cells in a neural pathway is supporting and regulating the connections it receives by trophic interactions with the cells it’s connected to down the line. Thus, a coordinated chain of connectivity extends from neuronal connections with the body’s muscles and organs to connections among neurons within the brain itself. The brain and body constitute a single, coherent and dynamic network; there is no way to separate them. They depend on each other at every level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ome artists go through distinct periods in their careers, while others stick to similar themes in and/or approaches to their work for decades. Scientists are the same. Most stick to trying to answer one particular question, getting deeper and deeper, as they figure out more and more details about their subject. Others find that, at some point, they are satisfied with the answers at hand and move on, finding a new question or challenge. Purves is the latter type of scientist, making multiple radical shifts in his scientific research. His important work supporting trophic theory had an obvious direction for continued investigation: using molecular tools to find new ways to visualise synaptic development. Purves was not interested. His research programme up to this time exploited easily manipulated and unambiguously visualised neural circuits in the peripheral nervous system. The brain itself is a different story, there where all the important action supposedly is; its complexity and density make it impossible to address the same questions – which connections are disappearing or multiplying – with the same degree of clarity and specificity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience was changing as well. By the time the late 1980s and ’90s rolled around, the most attention-getting work focused on the brain, particularly in the neocortex – the part that has disproportionately increased in size in primates like us. Many who were interested in how the brain developed were inspired by those Nobel Prize-winners, Hubel and Wiesel, who elegantly demonstrated that the visual part of the neocortex had a critical period of development. At this point, Purves had reached middle age, and he was at an impasse. The answer to the question ‘What to do next?’ was not self-evident. As an academic scientist, one can pretty much study whatever one wants, but it has to be interesting, potentially impactful and, for Purves especially, it has to be tractable: you should be able to formulate a clear hypothesis that could lead to an unambiguous finding. The answer came in the form of a new collaborator, Anthony-Samuel LaMantia, who joined his lab in 1988 as a postdoctoral fellow after completing his PhD on the development of the neocortex. Together, Purves and LaMantia decided to tackle the question ‘How does the brain grow?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Mice were not born with their full set of glomeruli; over the course of development, new ones were added&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many different kinds of brains, as many as there are animals. There is a beauty in all of them, perhaps because they adhere quite nicely to the form-follows-function principle of design. The designer in each case is natural selection’s influence on how a species develops, and thus the form its body and brain take in response to environmental challenges. Brain scientists study the anatomy of these solutions when we use any number of techniques like tracers, stains, imaging, etc. Each technique is suited to looking at the brain at a particular spatial scale. Consistently, what they reveal is that the brain is beautiful, sometimes stunning. At one of those scales, you can see repeated patterns of neural circuitry, or &lt;em&gt;modules&lt;/em&gt;, that look exactly like the spots and stripes we see on the skin of so many animals. For example, depending on what dyes you use to stain it, the visual cortex of primates has a pattern of stripes, with each stripe seemingly dedicated to the visual signals coming from one of our two eyes. Stain it another way, and you’ll see an array of ‘blobs’ that are claimed by some to be dedicated to colour processing. Other animals have different patterns: rats have an array of barrel-shaped modules in their somatosensory (touch) cortex which corresponds to their array of facial whiskers. Dolphins have blobs in their auditory cortex; we don’t know what their &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;function is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purves wanted to know how these iterated patterns of neural circuitry developed. He started by first looking just outside the neocortex, in the olfactory bulb of the mouse. In this structure, mice have a number of modules known as ‘glomeruli’. The olfactory bulbs of mice jut out from the main part of the brain and so are more accessible for experiments. Purves and LaMantia developed a method for exposing the bulbs in a live animal and staining the glomeruli with a dye that would not hurt the mice. They could then see that mice were not born with their full set of glomeruli; over the course of development, new ones were added. This was exciting and surprising because many popular theories at the time argued that brain development is mainly the result of selecting useful circuits from a larger repertoire of possible circuits. Here, they were showing that useful circuits were actually being constructed, not selected. Moreover, if circuits were constructed in this way after the animal is born, then the circuits might be influenced by experience. Were other modules in other species and brain areas added in the same way? In the macaque monkey visual cortex (ie, the experimental animal most closely related to humans and the brain area that is among the most studied) they couldn’t look at module development like they did in the mouse (looking at the same brain structure in the same animal repeatedly over time), but they were able to count the number of blobs in young monkeys versus adult monkeys. Unlike the glomeruli in mice, however, the number of blobs remained constant over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Purves, this was not super exciting. He had hoped to find more traction on perhaps a new process of neocortex development in primates, one that he could elaborate into a novel research programme. Nevertheless, he did come to one important conclusion. It seemed that most scientists – indeed, many luminaries of neuroscience – wanted to see brain modules as fundamental features of the neocortex, each serving a particular behavioural or perceptual purpose. For example, one ‘barrel’ in the rat’s touch cortex is there to process the inputs of one whisker on its face. Purves pointed out that iterated patterns of modules may be found in one species’ brain but absent in a closely related species. Moreover, he also noted that they don’t seem to be obligatorily linked to function. ‘Blobs’ are there in the human and the monkey visual cortex and are linked to colour-vision processing, but nocturnal primates with poor colour vision still have blobs in their visual cortex. So, the blobs do not seem to enable colour vision. Similarly, chinchillas have a barrel cortex like rats but don’t have the whisker movements of rats. Cats and dogs have whiskers but no related modules in their touch cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it seems that, while the iterated patterns of the brain are beautiful, they are unlike modern architecture in that their beauty is not linked to function. So why then do they form at all? Here, Purves &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016622369290180G" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that iterated patterns are the result of synaptic connections finding and relying on each other and then making more of those connections in pathways that are most active. In other words, the iterated patterns of the brain are epiphenomenal, the byproducts of the rules of neural connections and competing patterns of neural activity. Those activity patterns are generated by sensory inputs coming from the sensory organs – the eyes, ears, nose and skin. So seeing beautiful-looking patterns in the brain does not necessarily mean they were constructed for a particular purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;I &lt;/span&gt;first met Purves in 1993 when I was interviewing for graduate school after he had moved to Duke University. I had already read a lot of his work and was in awe of his contrarian instincts and pursuit of work that is out of the mainstream yet important. When I entered his office for my interview, I was extremely nervous but managed to ask about the portraits on his office walls. They were scientists. John Newport Langley, a 19th-century British physiologist who made important discoveries about neurotransmitters. He inspired the problems Purves tackled as a new professor. The aforementioned Viktor Hamburger was also there. He was a major figure in 20th-century embryology and also a good friend of Purves, despite the difference in their ages and experience. Another photo was of Stephen Kuffler, perhaps the most beloved figure in neuroscience at the time and who made key discoveries in vision. Kuffler had organised the neuroscience team who taught Purves when he was in medical school, and Purves considers him a mentor who exemplified what to pursue (and what not to pursue) in neuroscience. The final photo was of Bernard Katz, a Nobel laureate who figured out how neurons communicate with muscles. Purves collaborated with Katz in the 1970s and considers him a paragon of scientific excellence. I was admitted to Duke and, a year later, moved to Durham, North Carolina hoping to study with Purves or LaMantia, who was there too as a new professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at Duke, Purves was about to make a major change, away from studying the brain itself entirely. This seemed kind of crazy after so much success with discoveries about the developing nervous system, building an enviable career and becoming a sought-after leader in the field. But Purves’s restless instinct arose again and he switched his focus, this time to study perception. He had a hunch that the great advances wowing people about brain anatomy and the function of circuits therein were not going to be enough to make it clear how the brain works in actually guiding human behaviours. The origin of the hunch was in philosophy, which Purves had majored in as an undergraduate. The philosopher George Berkeley (1685-1753) had noticed that our eyeballs take in radically different-sized, three-dimensional objects and then project them back onto the retina (the sensory wall in the back of the eye) in exactly the same size and only in two dimensions (known as the inverse optics problem). This is why framing a distant human’s whole body between your two fingers, seemingly able to crush them, is amusing. It uses forced perspective to imply an impossibility. The implication of the inverse problem is profound. It means that the information about the object (the source) coming into our brain is uncertain, incomplete, partial.&lt;/p&gt;

Courtesy Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a solution to the inverse problem, the scientist Hermann von Helmholtz &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(1821-94)&lt;/span&gt; proposed that perception relied on learning from experience. We learn about objects through trial and error, and make inferences about any ambiguous image. Thus, since we have no experiences with lilliputian human beings, we can infer that the tiny human in the forced-perspective example is actually far away. Purves took the seed of Helmholtz’s idea – that our perception depends on experience – and built an entire research programme around it. Since the mid-1990s, he and his collaborators have systematically analysed a variety of visual illusions in brightness, contrast, motion, and geometry. They have shown that our perceptions are experience-based constructions, not accurate reflections of their sources in the real world. The example of ‘red’ from the beginning of this essay is based on his colour work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Our ability to perceive accurately is largely based on past experiences and learned associations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purves and his collaborator Beau Lotto would generate two identically coloured ‘target’ squares on a computer screen but give them backgrounds of different colours. The backgrounds would make the two squares look like they were different colours (even though they were actually identical, as measured by a spectrophotometer). Then, participants were asked to adjust the hue, saturation and brightness (the same controls on your phone’s camera app) of the target squares until they looked identical. Each participant’s adjustments were quantified and used as a difference measure between perception and reality. Ultimately, Purves’s research led to the conclusion that the brain functions on a wholly empirical basis. We construct our perception of the world through our past experiences in that world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a radical departure from the long-standing prevailing orthodoxy that the brain extracts features from objects and other sensory sources only to recombine them to guide our behaviour. Instead of extracting features and combining them in the brain (red+round = apple), Purves argues that it is our learned associations among an event or feature of the world, the context in which it appeared and the consequences of our subsequent actions that builds our umwelt, our self-centred world. The research of Purves and his collaborators showed that our ability to perceive accurately is largely based on past experiences and learned associations. This means that we must learn about the space around us, the objects in it and other aspects of perception; these are not innate but developed through interaction with the environment. This all seems very reasonable. The environment is always in flux, with different challenges at different times for any animal. You wouldn’t want your brain fine-tuned to an environment in which you no longer live. Equally, it also wouldn’t make sense for a species to build each individual’s brain as a &lt;em&gt;tabula rasa&lt;/em&gt;, to start from scratch with every generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purves’s findings and interpretation lead to a more philosophical puzzle. To what extent is the ‘environment’ that the brain is trying to make sense of actually ‘out there’ beyond our heads? Is there a real reality? Purves has shown that, even if there is a real reality, we don’t perceive much of it… or at least we don’t have a universal way of perceiving it. For example, not all humans see the same colours the same way. There are two reasons for this. One is that colour and its interpretation depend highly on environmental factors. The other is that perception also depends on experience. Experiences depend on your interaction with specific environments. Do you live in the sea, on land, in burrows, in a nest or in a climate-controlled house? Do you have vision, or are you blind? What do your physiology and anatomy allow you to perceive and interact with? What have you seen before? Your perception and interpretation of the world, and indeed those of other animals, depend on the answers to these types of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n her memoir &lt;em&gt;Pilgrim at Tinker Creek&lt;/em&gt; (1974), Annie Dillard writes about coming across a book on vision, which shows what happens when blind humans of all ages are suddenly given the ability to see. Does experience really determine how we see and act in the world? That book was &lt;em&gt;Space and Sight&lt;/em&gt; (1960). In it, Marius von Senden describes how patients who were blind at birth because of cataracts saw the world when those cataracts were removed. Were they able to see the world as we see it, those of us with vision since birth? No. Most patients did not. In one example from the book, Dillard recounts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Before the operation a doctor would give a blind patient a cube and a sphere; the patient would tongue it or feel it with his hands, and name it correctly. After the operation the doctor would show the same objects to the patient without letting him touch them; now he had no clue whatsoever what he was seeing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is even an example of a patient finally ‘seeing’ her mother but at a distance. Because of a lack of experience, she failed to understand the relationship between size and distance (forced perspective) that we learn from experience with sight. When asked how big her mother was, she set her two fingers a few inches apart. These types of experiments (which have been &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17201779/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;replicated&lt;/a&gt; in various ways) show just how important experience and learned associations are to making sense of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Purves has enough studies to show an operating principle of the nervous system or – more cautiously, he would say – ‘how it seems to work’. The function of the nervous system is to make, maintain and modify neural associations to guide adaptive behaviours – those that lead to survival and reproduction – in a world that sensory systems cannot accurately capture. It is not a stretch to link Purves’s work, all the way back, on trophic theory to the current ideas. A biological agent must assemble, without any blueprint or instructions, a nervous system that matches the shape and size of a changing body. This nervous system, paired with sensory organs that filter the world in peculiar ways, must somehow process the physical states of the world in order to guide behaviour. Similar principles – neural activity, changing synaptic connections – that guided development also guide our ongoing perceptions of an ever-changing world. We use our individual experiences to do this guiding. If we happen to perceive or interpret events like other human beings, it is because we have similar bodies &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;shared similar experiences at some point. To my experience, &lt;em&gt;Purves &lt;/em&gt;is a paragon of scientific excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Purves first identifies a big, interesting question, and then finds whatever means are necessary to find the answer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I asked Purves how he thought of the arc of his career, and it was very different from my perception of it. From my perspective, it seems that Purves’s question is always ‘How is a nervous system built?’ Addressing this question took him to increasingly large scales: from trophic theory and neural connections in the peripheral nervous system to neural construction of the brain (iterated patterns; growth of the neocortex) to the relationships between brain-area size and perceptual acuity to the construction of ‘reality’ via experience. I asked him what he thought about this narrative, and he responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;That is one way of framing it, but I don’t really see a narrative arc. As you know, one’s work is often driven by venal/trivial considerations such as what research direction has a better chance of winning grant support or addressing the popular issues of the day. The theme you mention (how nervous systems are built) was not much in my thinking, although in retrospect that narrative seems &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;to fit.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither one of us is wrong. In fact, we are interpreting the body of work according to our own experiences and how it best suits our needs, just as his research would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purves’s remarkable research insights are the product of his distinctive approach to science. A popular approach in neuroscience is to identify one problem early in a career and to just keep plugging away, learning more and more details about it. Then, maybe acquire an exciting new technique – like fMRI in the 1990s or optogenetics in the 2000s – to investigate the same problem in a different way. Or adopt the new technique and then search for a new question that could be answered by that method. Another approach would be to just apply the method, collect some data and only then ask what story can be told with those data. None of these approaches is ‘wrong’, but Purves’s scientific approach is in stark contrast to this. He first identifies a big, interesting question, one that could possibly have a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer, and then finds whatever means are necessary to find the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, there is a lot of thought behind his work and approach, and there is a lot of thought about what any findings may mean in the big picture of brain science. Purves is always engaged. Very few scientists have impactful work in multiple domains of their field. Purves increased our understanding of brain development, from small circuits to big ones, and from bodily experience to a new way of thinking about how the brain

Additionally, the study found that both rice and wheat showed the same impact on diabetes and obesity and noted that overall protein intake in India remains suboptimal, averaging 12% of daily calories, with the highest at 14% in the Northeast, according R.M. Anjana, lead author of the study, Department of Diabetology, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, Chennai. “We also investigated the associations between dietary factors and metabolic risk, and evaluated the effects of isocaloric substitution of macronutrients on glycaemia and adiposity,’’ noted researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;What data was used?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted using data from the &lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/31-million-more-indians-became-diabetic-between-2019-2021-says-study/article66949970.ece" target="_self"&gt;national Indian Council of Medical Research –India Diabetes Survey (18,090 adults)&lt;/a&gt; where researchers had examined India’s dietary profile and the effect of isocaloric substitution of carbohydrates with other macronutrients on metabolic risk. The ICMR-INDIAB study was a national cross-sectional population-based survey conducted from November 2008 to December 2020. The largest survey of its kind in India, it was conducted by the ICMR to assess the prevalence of metabolic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including diabetes, hypertension, and obesity in a nationally representative sample. Dietary data from every fifth participant were used to characterize India’s dietary profile across regions and examine inter-regional and intraregional differences in macronutrient intakes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey reported (weighted for region, age and sex) prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prediabetes as 11.4% and 15.3%, respectively. The prevalence of generalized obesity and abdominal obesity was also high at 28.6% and 39.5%, respectively. NCDs account for 6.3 million (68%) of all deaths in India. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;The diet-health connection&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present study found that &lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/indias-burden-of-malnutrition-and-obesity-where-diet-makes-or-breaks/article69610105.ece" target="_self"&gt;unhealthy diets contribute substantially to the NCD burden&lt;/a&gt;. Improving diet and physical activity can prevent nearly 50% of the incident of type 2 diabetes (T2D). “Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are major contributors to morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. India, home to nearly 20% of the global population, has undergone rapid nutrition and epidemiological transitions over the past two decades, resulting in an alarming increase in NCD prevalence,’’ warned the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India, data from epidemiological studies and national nutrition surveys, such as those by the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) and National Sample Survey Organisation, indicate that Indian adults currently consume ~65% to 75% of calories from carbohydrates (one of the highest in the world), 9–11% from proteins and 14–23% from fats. Recommendations for a balanced diet state that only 50-55% of total calories should from carbohydrates, with no more than 45% coming from cereals and millets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Economic costs of bad diet&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2060, the economic costs of overweight and obesity are projected to reach $839 billion (2.47% of the nation’s GDP). Given the enormous public health burden of NCDs and their associated economic costs, it is crucial to identify cost-effective, practical strategies for reducing NCD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="articleblock-container" id="arthardpv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="update-publish-time article-published-time-end"&gt;&lt;p class="publish-time-new"&gt; Published &lt;span&gt;- October 06, 2025 02:29 pm IST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="spliter pt-0 mb-0 print-hide"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="d-none d-lg-block d-xl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="d-block d-sm-none "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Hindu</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 08:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>美国国立卫生研究院命令我停止“危险的”功能获取研究。它一点也不危险- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/10/06/gain-of-function-research-tuberculosis-expert-nih/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 11, I received a letter from the National Institutes of Health ordering me to stop my research on Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, because the work was deemed too “dangerous.” Surely this must be a mistake, I thought, since my lab has been operating safely for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am an associate professor of molecular and cell biology at University of California, Berkeley, where I study TB. I’m also a principal investigator on two grants from the NIH in which experiments using routine techniques were abruptly flagged as possible “dangerous gain-of-function research.” My work isn’t dangerous, but stopping research that could lead to cures could be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In wealthy countries, people think TB is a disease of the past. Advances in medicine and public health have virtually eradicated it from the U.S. and western Europe. Yet globally, TB kills more people than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;any other infectious disease&lt;/a&gt; and is also becoming more difficult to treat as drug resistance increases. If we lose the ability to treat TB with existing drugs, the whole world, including the United States, is at risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers in my lab and many others across the country are striving to perform research that is essential for the discovery of new drugs to eradicate TB and prevent its worldwide resurgence. The &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/19/tuberculosis-kansas-city-missouri-tb-outbreak-treatment/"&gt;2024-25 TB outbreak in Kansas City&lt;/a&gt; — more than 100 cases, making it the largest in the U.S. in decades — is a clear reminder that the risk is not just theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technically, my work on TB &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;involve gain of function, a category of research that has been both politicized and widely misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Gain of function” is a broad category of research that involves genetically altering an organism to give it new abilities. Gain-of-function experiments have been crucial for increasing our understanding of bacteria like M. tuberculosis in the pursuit of discovering new treatments. These techniques have also been essential in developing new therapies for cancer, new vaccines, and treatments to improve crop resiliency and animal health. Gain-of-function research has provided enormous benefits for clinical therapies, including the hepatitis B vaccine, CAR T-cells for cancer, and modified adenoviruses used in gene therapies for muscular dystrophy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIH letter terminating my research cited a May executive order in which the president ordered a stop to “dangerous gain-of-function research.” That is a very small subset of gain-of-function research, in which a potentially disease-causing organism is made more virulent, more transmissible, or more capable of infecting new hosts. Because this type of research can be risky, I fully support requiring robust safety measures to ensure it is conducted responsibly. Decisions designating research as “dangerous” must be transparent, deliberative, and scientifically informed. This approach is vital to prevent the unwarranted curtailment of safe research that serves the public good.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My grants were flagged as “dangerous” by NIH officials for two common practices in TB research that have been used safely for decades. First, to pinpoint the weaknesses of M. tuberculosis, we create genetic mutations that disable specific genes. These mutations actually make the bacterium less virulent — the opposite goal of gain-of-function research. Second, we often use resistance to kanamycin, an antibiotic not used to treat humans because of severe side effects, to isolate mutated strains. The kanamycin kills all of the bacteria except for that which is resistant. We use kanamycin resistance as a molecular marker — like a genetic ID badge — that allows us to identify and isolate the small percentage of bacteria in a population that we have successfully modified, since only these bacteria can survive when exposed to the antibiotic kanamycin. Our kanamycin-resistant strains are fully treatable by all clinically used antibiotics and cannot spread drug resistance to other strains, so they pose no risk to the public. The use of kanamycin has not been considered dangerous by any reasonable definition, and that has been true for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our techniques are essential to lifesaving TB research. Yet my colleagues across the country have also received letters targeting practices that have been proven safe over decades and remain crucial to finding new drugs and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much of the TB research targeted by the NIH uses standard approaches that adhere to very strict laboratory guidelines and that have been reviewed by institutional committees of scientists, biosafety experts, and members of the public. My work is conducted in a Biosafety Level 3 facility with stringent requirements: personal protective equipment, including protective clothing and respiratory protection; only working with live bacteria within biosafety cabinets that prevent release of organisms into the environment; and using rooms with specialized ventilation to provide an additional layer of containment.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Limiting dangerous gain-of-function research is an important goal. But effective oversight must utilize scientific knowledge to distinguish between low-risk and actual, demonstrable threats so that we do not impede progress against deadly diseases for no real safety benefit. An overly broad approach, with the resulting ramifications for lifesaving research we’re already seeing, could be exacerbated by the recently proposed “Risky Research Review Act.” Without clear definitions, scientific expertise, and streamlined review processes, lifesaving research could be stopped. This would be an even bigger threat to public health than the broad, misinformed definition of “dangerous” that is being applied here. &lt;/p&gt;

after an accident - he had been given a blood transfusion at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Campbell went back to the doctors for a test and they confirmed hepatitis C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Maegan says Campbell was a good dad at first&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The virus had been undiagnosed for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Known as the "silent killer", hep C may cause few symptoms initially, with early signs including night sweats, brain fog, itchy skin and fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But for every year a person carries the virus, their chance of dying from liver cirrhosis and related cancers increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Meagan, who is now 28, says her father was angry that it had taken so long to get a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I also felt at the time he felt a little bit of shame too, he didn't want anyone to know, just wanted to keep it to himself, but mostly angry, we all were," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Campbell died in 2024, at the age of 61, just five years after finding out he had the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Over those last few years he wasn't himself," Maegan says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"He wasn't the dad that I knew. He had a lot of brain fog, it affected him, it affected his personality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Maegan wonders what their relationship might have been, had they known Campbell was genuinely very ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I feel a lot of guilt a lot," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"If I'd known then, what I know now, I think our relationship would have been a lot different.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I myself have suffered a lot of mental health problems because of the breakdown of my relationship with my dad.

affected, the UK government ordered an inquiry, conducted by Sir Brian Langstaff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Last year, his main report found that along with donations being sought from high-risk groups, donors were not routinely screened before September 1991, despite the risk of bloodborne viruses being known about since the 1940s.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Shockingly, it also found that the government, civil service and NHS, over decades tried to cover up and deny this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In October 2024, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said that the government had set aside £11.8bn to pay compensation to victims via the Infected Blood Compensation Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Before he died Campbell McPhee got an interim payment of £100,000 from the Scottish Infected Blood Support Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, there's been criticism that full compensation is glacially slow in being paid out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Earlier this year Sir Brian called the delay in providing it to victims as creating "an injustice all of its own".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Lawyer Jamie Lyons

bJoRPJ"&gt;Jamie Lyons, of the legal firm Thorntons, who represents Maegan, has dozens of clients angry about the length of time it's taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He says: "The scheme has just ground to a halt as far as we are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"The vast majority of cases that we have are all just sitting there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We can't really do much until the full scheme opens up and the date for that is repeatedly being pushed back."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He added: "There's a risk people are dying, whilst they wait for these schemes to open up for payments to be made."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Mr Lyons says there could be people affected that don't know it yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I think there's people going around that don't have the slightest idea that they may have been infected due to this," he says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"They could be getting treated for other illnesses that they've been told they have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I've certainly seen that, people being given the wrong diagnosis, people being told it could have been something else that's contributed to the infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;A spokesperson said people have waited decades for recognition and compensation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Since we were established and began the very first claims late last year, our priority has been to pay as many people as quickly as possible," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Today, we have opened claims for almost all of the living infected people who are registered with a support scheme (almost 3,500 people so far) and made more than £1bn in compensation offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We have accepted the recommendations in the Infected Blood Inquiry's Additional Report and by the end of the year, we will have opened the service to some people from every group making a compensation claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"This will include those people who are infected and have never received any compensation, those claiming on behalf of deceased infected people who were sadly never able to make their claim, and those who are affected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;More than 3,000 people have died in the UK, and thousands more live with health conditions as a result of this scandal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For Maegan, it's not about the money, its about pain, apology and acknowledgement for the victims and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I want everyone to know what the NHS did to these people and my dad and not just the people who have been infected but their families and everybody that loves them because it has a ripple effect," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I want acknowledgement and I want them to be

&lt;p id="7a93b7df-50c6-4469-80b3-c12590c7218d"&gt;I love a good walk, but time and childcare restraints mean that I don’t get out in the fresh air as often as I’d like.

The original routine consists of five intervals of three minutes of brisk walking with three minutes of slow walking, performed four times a week, and a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/apnm-2023-0595" target="_blank" data-url="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/apnm-2023-0595" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;number of studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown a raft of health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="7a93b7df-50c6-4469-80b3-c12590c7218d-2"&gt;April, who trains with her 84-year-old mum Aiko, has modified the workout, reducing the number of intervals performed to three and Aiko spends the recovery period taking steps while seated, so it’s a good option for anyone who struggles with balance or standing for too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="396cd4b5-ad05-4412-9aa9-422ba4a752ad"&gt;Even though it was only 20 minutes, I found it surprisingly energizing.

Not only do April and her mom Aiko have a lovely relationship, their sweet interactions and chats about New York life were a great distraction from the workout, making time speed up and my stress levels go down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-it-helped-me-get-some-steps-in" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-helped-me-get-some-steps-in"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It helped me get some steps in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="159f70a9-35b0-44d8-adce-643bc167894d"&gt;If I’m not sitting at my desk writing articles, I’m doing my other job as a personal trainer, so it can sometimes be a challenge to reach my goal of 10,000 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-oM7TVGSqLpSasDMTM8zYFD" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-oM7TVGSqLpSasDMTM8zYFD slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing this workout is a good start, and I enjoyed the different pace of fast and slow walking as it was a more gentle style of training then I’m used to, so I felt I still had the energy to go after my target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="58607f27-a0e2-4f21-a564-084d4e606eab"&gt;It’s normal to have exercise preferences. Maybe your heart sings every time you get to do a biceps curl, or you’re a fiend for sit-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s also normal to find certain moves more difficult than others—and according to Peloton trainer Ben Alldis, there’s a certain set of moves beginners usually dislike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="58607f27-a0e2-4f21-a564-084d4e606eab-2"&gt;“People find lower-body strength really challenging to begin with,” says Alldis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging the large muscles in your legs and rear can be tiring, and the subsequent DOMS (delayed-onset muscle soreness) can be uncomfortable, but Alldis insists that it’s all worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can actually get an incredible workout from lower-body training that offers more than just lower-body strength,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower-body workouts engage large muscle groups like your quads and glutes, which will push your heart rate up and challenge your cardio fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, keeping your lower-body muscles strong and mobile will help you remain able to perform functional movements as you age, like walking, running and climbing stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Jj8cyirSrNPUrhGBvyGp2S" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Jj8cyirSrNPUrhGBvyGp2S slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the Peloton trainer’s three favorite moves to do at home—all you need to do them is a set of dumbbells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-squat" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-squat"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

Hold a weight at your chest to make the move harder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bend your knees, keeping them pointing in the same direction as your toes, and sit your hips back to lower until your thighs are parallel to the floor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Push through your heels and stand up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="29826921-0c02-46b9-9185-59e391c3c881"&gt;Alldis explains that squats are useful because they’re a multi-muscle movement, targeting your quads, glutes and hamstrings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practicing this move will serve you in older age, too. It’s a movement that mimics getting in and out of a chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-lunge" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-lunge"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

Whether one is preparing a basic dal tadka, or quick salad, a handful of chopped onions usually finds it way to the mix! While most of us treat onions as a flavour basic, very few realise what it actually offers in terms of health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Dr. William Li, a well-known physician and researcher in the field of nutrition and food, shared his enlightening thoughts on a unique variety of onions he found at the farmers' market. Not the appearance but nutritionally, what red onions can do is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The colour tells a story&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deep reddish-purple colour of the red onions is not just "there", it is more than a visual appeal. The vibrant shade of onions comes from a compound called anthocyanins, they are natural antioxidants. These are also found in different foods, jamun, strawberries and eggplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Wondering what anthocyanins can do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like every other antioxidant, anthocyanins also help protect the body from oxidative stress, in simpler words, they reduce cell damage when consumed in the form of food, supporting immune system and help fight inflammation as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation has been proved to be the root cause of all diseases such as diabetes, heart related ailments and even joint pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something as simple as red onions, when consumed along with meals or in meals can help the body stay balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The hero compound: Quercetin&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What really sets onions apart, is the plant based component called as quercetin, which is basically a flavonoid, that acts a natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quercetin related research has proved its potential role in reducing blood pressure, improving heart health and even fighting against certain types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10384403/#sec6-pharmaceuticals-16-01020" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;about the recent advances in potential health benefits of quercetin, in PubMed central shows that Emerging evidence suggests that quercetin may be a potent player in the fight against viral infections. Its antiviral properties, which extend to combatting influenza, hepatitis B and C viruses, and HIV, make it an appealing candidate for future antiviral therapies. Researchers are hopeful that with further development, quercetin-based medications could revolutionize the treatment of viral diseases, potentially reducing the burden of global health crises. One of the most exciting revelations is quercetin’s anticancer potential. Studies have shown that it can hinder cancer cell proliferation and trigger apoptosis in various cancer types, including breast, lung, prostate, and colon cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Li points out that quercetin works quietly in the background, helping the body control inflammation, and supporting overall health, and onions are the best natural sources of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Onions in traditional and modern cuisines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Indian cooking, onions are already a core ingredient. Whether raw or cooked, they play a big role in flavour and texture. but now, we also know that their health value is just as strong!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belonging to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0254629924000528" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;allium family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, which also includes, garlic, shallots, and leeks, all of which are common components of both Mediterranean and Asian diets. Allium species have been recommended in traditional medicine for its efficacy in treating a variety of diseases such as arthritis, cardiovascular and kidney diseases, diabetes, colds, flu, headache, cough, hemorrhage, atherosclerosis, asthma, cancer, colic and skin problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike imported vegetables and fruits, onions are available in every local market. According to Dr. Li, don’t overlook what’s already in front of you.

They estimated each individual's exposure to pollutants based on &lt;a href="https://canue.ca/data-tools/canue-data/"&gt;environmental records&lt;/a&gt; on the location of their primary residence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the researchers compared measures of sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a compound produced by the combustion of coal and oil-based fuels. Previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/c6tx00314a"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to brain damage, the pollutant had not been studied in relation to ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-hairstyle-could-generate-pollution-on-par-with-busy-traffic"&gt;Your Hairstyle Could Generate Pollution on Par With Busy Traffic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that those diagnosed with ALS in their sample had "a significantly higher history" of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exposure than the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the association doesn't prove direct cause and effect, it's a strong link and a worrying finding – especially as all the areas covered by the study were well within &lt;a href="https://ccme.ca/en/air-quality-report"&gt;the official guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for 'clean' air quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings support the association between long-term exposure to air pollutants, particularly sulfur dioxide, and the development of ALS, supporting the need for improved air pollution control measures," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.122232"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176270" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176270" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/GraphicalAbstract.jpg" alt="Graphical abstract" class="wp-image-176270 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/GraphicalAbstract.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/GraphicalAbstract-600x203.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176270" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Of the pollutants examined, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was the only one with a significant link to ALS. (Saucier et al., &lt;em&gt;Environ. Res.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) – also a by-product of car fumes and coal-fired power stations – has previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1115"&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to ALS risk, but this analysis didn't show any meaningful association after adjusting for other factors (including socioeconomic factors).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that levels of sulfur dioxide prior to symptoms appearing were far more critical than measures taken in years before a diagnosis, suggesting individuals were often at a 'point of no return' by the time they were evaluated by medical specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first study to highlight that higher levels of ambient SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in residential areas relate to an increased risk of ALS," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.122232"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ALS &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000351153"&gt;remains rare&lt;/a&gt;, with around &lt;a href="https://alsnc.org/understanding-als/who-gets-als/"&gt;1 to 2 new cases per 100,000 people&lt;/a&gt; per year reported worldwide, its effects are devastating. The condition gradually destroys nerve cells to cause paralysis, and in the majority of cases is fatal within three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are continuing to discover more about ALS, but its cause is yet to be determined – there's typically no family history of the condition, for instance. Risk factors, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vigorous-physical-activity-linked-to-increased-risk-of-developing-als-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-mnd"&gt;physical exercise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mysterious-form-of-als-identified-in-children-with-rare-genetic-mutations"&gt;genetic mutations&lt;/a&gt;, have been identified, but overall, the picture isn't a clear one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's likely that a combination of factors combine to put the necessary mechanisms in motion, and from this and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.114510"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt;, it seems probable that air pollution is among them. Of course, we also know that the same smog of modern living has also been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-3-years-of-air-pollution-can-increase-lung-cancer-risk-study-warns"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/air-pollution-isnt-only-bad-for-lungs-say-studies-its-also-bad-for-mental-health"&gt;poor mental health&lt;/a&gt;, among other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind this latest study are keen to see further investigations into the effects of pollutants on ALS risk, and suggest that air quality regulations should be tighter – even as fossil fuels &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-is-how-much-fossil-fuel-the-world-is-sitting-on-and-its-a-time-bomb"&gt;continue to burn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a necessity for prevention strategies and improved regulatory intervention on behalf of public health on air pollution exposure levels," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.122232"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.122232"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Environmental Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Their earlier work had shown that using only small portions of the HPV genome or more limited assays yielded reduced accuracy, especially for early or minimal disease. By contrast, HPV-DeepSeek’s “look broadly” approach improves detection, especially in early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In follow-up validation, the researchers are applying the test to larger, blinded sample sets, including those from national repositories such as the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key principle is liquid biopsy – detecting fragments of tumor DNA circulating in the blood (often called circulating tumor DNA, ctDNA). But HPV-DeepSeek goes further: it uses whole-genome sequencing of the entire HPV genome, along with advanced machine-learning approaches, to find even minute viral DNA fragments and other biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their studies, researchers tested archived blood samples collected years before diagnosis. Among 28 individuals who later developed HPV-associated head and neck cancer, HPV-DeepSeek detected HPV DNA in 22 of them, and all 28 healthy control samples tested negative. By improving the algorithm with machine learning, they achieved a detection rate of 27 out of 28 in follow-ups, including in samples as old as 10 years before diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test also shows very high specificity (i.e., few false positives) and sensitivity (i.e., true positives) reported as 99% for both inpatients at their first clinical presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 02:00:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>根据专家的说法，廉价的厨房香料可以预防痴呆症-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15133991/kitchen-spices-Alzheimers-dementia-heart-disease.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have identified simple and cheap ingredients that can help stave off dementia, and some of them may already be in your kitchen cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While early research has suggested that spices like saffron and cumin may support brain health, a study published this month explains the mechanism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A team from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/south-korea/index.html" id="mol-2e0b1530-9e3c-11f0-9827-d34909a7daef"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt; discovered that compounds in these spices target dysfunctional proteins associated with three key genes that serve as master regulators of inflammation and other processes common to &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-2e082f00-9e3c-11f0-9827-d34909a7daef"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disruption of these proteins throws essential processes like inflammation and cell survival into chaos, dramatically increasing the risk for both diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By regulating these key proteins, the spice compounds help protect the brain's vital connections, which are damaged in Alzheimer's. By helping to calm inflammation and protect blood vessels, these spice compounds also significantly benefit heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, heart disease is the leading cause of death, accounting for about one in five deaths every year. And as the aging population grows, Alzheimer’s disease rates are expected to balloon from a current 7 million to about 13 million in the next 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rich &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14125671/secret-hidden-chillies-heart-disease-dementia.html"&gt;in anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; and antioxidant compounds, these everyday spices represent a promising, natural avenue for preventing both threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cooking with spices cumin, saffron, sumac, and cardamom may help reduce the risk of both Alzheimer's and heart disease by targeting the brain and heart's shared biological roots (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists in &lt;span&gt;a recent study, &lt;span&gt;published in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482525009278#sec4" class=""&gt;Computers in Biology and Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, utilized computer simulations to explore the potential of spices in combating&lt;/span&gt; Alzheimer's and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, they made a list of all the natural compounds found in 10 spices central to Saudi Arabian cuisine and traditional medicine: cumin, caraway, cardamom, saffron, sumac, ajwain, amla, assafoetida, brahmi and myrrh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These spices offer targeted benefits: sumac and saffron are powerful antioxidants (substances that protect cells from toxins); ajwain, cumin, and caraway aid digestion; cardamom and saffron can boost mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Myrrh serves as a potent antiseptic - protecting against infection - amla is a Vitamin C powerhouse for the immune system, and brahmi is revered as a brain tonic for memory and anxiety in Ayurvedic medicine, a practice rooted in Indian tradition that aims to promote health by balancing the mind, body and spirit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Together, they contribute to a diet rich in compounds that combat oxidative stress, which is considered the root cause of aging and chronic diseases, such as cancer, heart disease and brain decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used databases to predict which compounds in the 10 spices could be absorbed, reach the brain, and avoid causing liver damage. The initial filter prioritized compounds that the gut could absorb, cross the blood-brain barrier to reach their target and, crucially, not cause liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They zeroed in on three compounds: kaempferol, apigenin and myristic acid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Next, the team used a technique called network pharmacology to map the complex relationships between the spice compounds and the genes involved in both Alzheimer's and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Human trials show that cumin can improve key heart disease risk factors by lowering bad cholesterol and blood fats while raising good cholesterol (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Saffron is one of the most researched spices for brain health. In fact, clinical trials have found that saffron extract can improve cognitive function as effectively as a standard Alzheimer's drug (donepezil) in patients with mild to moderate symptoms (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This analysis revealed three key genes, AKT1, SRC and TP53, that function as central hubs, meaning their dysfunction is critically involved in the biological pathways of both Alzheimer's and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, they used advanced computer modeling to simulate how the most promising spice compounds would physically interact with proteins related to these key genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The simulations showed that those three specific compounds bind stably to the key disease-related proteins, suggesting they could help calm harmful inflammation, reduce oxidative stress and protect cells from dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another study from last month, researchers in Taiwan found that a compound in cinnamon may help fight Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-025-03492-3"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;focused on sodium benzoate, a substance the body produces when it metabolizes certain compounds, including cinnamon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients with mild Alzheimer's who took daily capsules of sodium benzoate at 500 mg, 750 mg or 1000 mg for 24 weeks showed significant improvements in cognitive function compared to those who took a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The treatment worked by directly targeting a key culprit in Alzheimer's, the toxic amyloid-beta protein that forms plaques in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two higher doses of sodium benzoate significantly reduced levels of this harmful protein in the blood. The treatment was also found to be as safe as the placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One study showed a cinnamon-derived substance improved cognitive function and reduced a key Alzheimer's protein in patients. Another study identified a different cinnamon compound that effectively targets a major Alzheimer's gene (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research suggested that the cinnamon-derived compound could be a safer, more accessible alternative to limited and very expensive Alzheimer's treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors cautioned that they used pharmaceutical-grade doses far higher than what the average American would get from eating the cinnamon in their cupboards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A different team of researchers zeroed in on another beneficial compound in cinnamon, epicatechin, in a 2023 study published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301462223000418"&gt;Biophysical Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, which revealed its exceptional ability to bind to the ApoE4 protein, a key driver of Alzheimer's risk linked to a specific genetic variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers designed modified versions of the flavonoid epicatechin by adding a specific chemical group to its structure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This alteration created new compounds that bind to the ApoE4 protein far more effectively than the original molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This enhanced binding is crucial because it helps the ApoE4 protein clear away toxic amyloid-beta peptides in the brain, preventing them from clumping into the plaques that define Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Separately, among the spices analyzed for cognitive benefits, saffron remains one of the most well-studied and promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several clinical trials have shown that saffron extract &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19838862/"&gt;can be as effective&lt;/a&gt; as donepezil, a common Alzheimer's medication, in improving cognitive function in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Falling birth rates and an aging population will lead to a sharp rise in Alzheimer's cases.

After 1 to 2 weeks, the disease often enters the paroxysmal (coughing-fit) stage, which is more alarming. Typical signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intense, rapid coughing fits (paroxysms) that can last for 1 to 6 weeks or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-pitched “whoop” sound when inhaling after a bout of coughing (not everyone develops this).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vomiting after coughing fits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exhaustion, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In infants, the “whoop” might not appear; what is seen instead may be apnea (pauses in breathing), cyanosis (turning blue), feeding problems, or choking episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In older children and adults, sometimes the only symptom is a prolonged hacking cough without the whoop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the early phase is so mild, many cases go undiagnosed until the cough becomes severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 00:32:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>间歇散步：为什么这种3分钟的日式散步技巧比慢跑更有好处-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/fitness/interval-walking-why-this-3-minute-japanese-walking-technique-can-give-you-greater-benefits-than-jogging/articleshow/124323028.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might sound hard to believe but walking can burn more fat than jogging, when it’s done the ‘Japanese way’. This new fitness trend, called “Interval Walking Training” is developed by Professors at the Shinshu University in Japan, has become a new favorite among fitness enthusiasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the &lt;keyword id="27094849" type="General" weightage="100" keywordseo="Japanese-walking-technique" source="keywords"&gt;Japanese walking technique&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interval walking is a scientifically designed exercise method where instead of a casual stroll, a combination of brisk walking and slow paced walking is alternately incorporated. The technique follows a simple rhythm: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 minutes of brisk walking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 minutes of slow walking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeating the cycle for 30 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Hiroshi Nore, one of the professors who developed this method says, this technique was designed to make walking more beneficial for fat burning and cardiovascular health, especially for people with sedentary lifestyle and older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Morning Habits for Longevity and Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternating between fast and slow pace is what makes this technique special. This technique activates aerobic and anaerobic systems, triggers excess post exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) and stimulates mitochondrial activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brisk intervals raise your heart rate and burn fat, while slow phases allow recovery but keep metabolism elevated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26950358/" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;Afterburn effect&lt;/a&gt; (EPOC), meaning your body continues to burn calories for hours after the walk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Activated&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7117801/" data-type="tilCustomLink"&gt; mitochondria improves energy production&lt;/a&gt;, endurance and fat metabolism. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What makes this technique better than jogging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study conducted at Shinshu University found that participants practicing interval walking for five months lost 3–5 kg of fat, while those walking at a steady pace saw much smaller changes. Another &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2018.32.1_supplement.588.9" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;found, for older people, interval walking technique over 10 years protected against age related fitness complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shinshu University study also suggested that report improvements in VO₂ max and reductions in systolic blood pressure over several months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is this technique for everyone?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple approach of this walking technique definitely makes it stand out. However, there aren’t many studies that have incorporated the Japanese walking technique. Whether you should try this method or not, depends on your individual health status. Interval walking is low-impact compared to jogging or running, so it’s generally safe for beginners, older adults, and people with sedentary lifestyles. In contrast, people with heart conditions, uncontrolled high blood pressure, joint problems, or other medical concerns should consult a healthcare professional before starting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwJBVV95cUxNelRXa3NvZ3M2bFAwckx6YXlFS0RvbnVYTG03RmxxUVJiVHpwNzdKSWVzYUVjMDJHMDdqdlpGOWNteG1rWHRLQTFaTEFMSEVFa2ZHWTV5VmJ0dm1BLXE3LXIydFV3NXBNUDVjb25vSGVQSG02X3Y1dEE1QWRCbURPV3pUeldscEYxU2tGa1U0ZTF3OWx1UTZ1U1N2MWV5TzNSZmZ1VzNLY1FwRURLeXlBZDlUNmRYWElIbUlDc1NPMHlyajZxSlBtcHUyWmhhaGU2MUNMVUVNMGZxbGpEOTR2OWk5VWVybWlCN0ZfR1VENkJJTW15dU5jTjFHVmpUWF9wSW9jZk1rb0dMelV2cGU1SElNQnNkRld3T19jNzhfTVJGRlV6ZkpZ</guid></item><item><title>对50万份医疗记录与阿尔茨海默氏症病毒一次又一次关联的研究- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/a-study-of-500000-medical-records-linked-viruses-with-alzheimers-again-and-again</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

(For every 406 viral encephalitis cases, 24 went on to develop Alzheimer's disease – around 6 percent.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-could-be-linked-to-a-common-virus-you-already-have"&gt;Alzheimer's Could Be Linked to a Common Virus You Already Have&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who were hospitalized with pneumonia after catching the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="176452" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be more susceptible to Alzheimer's disease, dementia, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intestinal infections and meningitis (both often caused by a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="176452" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the varicella-zoster virus, which causes shingles, were also implicated in the development of several neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176454" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176454" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/varicella_zoster-virus_toddler_642.jpg" alt="chicken pox on a toddler" class="wp-image-176454 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/varicella_zoster-virus_toddler_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/varicella_zoster-virus_toddler_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176454" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Varicella-zoster virus is responsible for diseases such as chicken pox.

&lt;p&gt;There is no cure for Huntington’s disease, a devastating brain disorder that causes severe motor loss, dementia, and eventual death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, a clinical trial delivered positive results this week, finding that patients receiving a new treatment for 36 months experienced 75% less progression of the disease overall (compared to patients who did not receive the treatment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time a drug trial achieved a significant slowing of Huntington’s progression, according to uniQurea, a gene therapy company based in the Netherlands and US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new gene therapy, AMT-130, was performed on 29 patients including 12 who were given a high dose. Those given a high dosage of AMT-130 experienced 75% less disease progression, as measured by a standard rating scale that incorporates motor, cognitive, and functional measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a statistically significant benefit as measured by other scales of disease progression, including motor and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers also measured participants’ levels of neurofilament light protein (NfL), a protein that is released into the spinal fluid when neurons are injured—a useful marker for neuronal damage. The scientists found that NfL levels in the spinal fluid were lower in people treated with the drug than they had been at the start of the trial, even though NfL levels would be expected to increase by 20-30% over three years. They say this suggests the course of the disease has been slowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial, conducted by scientists at University College London (UCL) with funding from uniQure, also found that “AMT-130 is generally well-tolerated by study participants and has a manageable safety profile”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“l am thrilled,” said Professor Sarah Tabrizi of UCL’s Huntington’s Disease Research Centre and lead scientific advisor on the trial. “For patients, AMT-130 has the potential to preserve daily function, keep them in work longer, and meaningfully slow disease progression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is expected that a single dose of AMT-130 would last for a person’s whole life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE MIRACLE OF SIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="100 Times Improvement in Sight Seen After Gene Therapy Trial for Disease That Deteriorates Vision in Childhood" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/100-times-improvement-in-sight-seen-after-gene-therapy-trial/" rel="bookmark"&gt;100 Times Improvement in Sight Seen After Gene Therapy Trial for Disease That Deteriorates Vision in Childhood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UniQure plans to submit an application to the US Food and Drug Administration early next year requesting accelerated approval to market the drug, with applications in the UK and Europe to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This result changes everything,” said Professor Ed Wild, principal investigator of the UCL Huntington’s Disease Centre trial site at UCL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My patients in the trial are stable over time in a way I’m not used to seeing in Huntington’s disease – and one of them is my only medically-retired Huntington’s disease patient who has been able to go back to work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Behind each datapoint is an incredible patient who volunteered to undergo major neurosurgery to be treated,” &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/sep/gene-therapy-appears-slow-huntingtons-disease-progression" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;added Prof. Wild&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the treatment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease is caused by a single genetic mutation, a discovery made in 1993. People with an affected parent have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation, meaning they will develop disease symptoms—but until now, there were no effective treatments to prevent or slow the progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 12,000 people in the U.S. are currently living with Huntington’s disease, and about 8,000 in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new gene therapy permanently introduces new functional DNA into a person’s cells. It consists of particles of a harmless, empty virus, plus a set of instructions encoded in custom-made DNA. The virus is injected directly into a part of the brain called the striatum which is particularly vulnerable in Huntington’s disease. This is done using a highly complex neurosurgical technique called stereotactic surgery, in which tiny tubes called catheters are guided to the right part of the brain. Once in the brain, the virus particles enter the neurons and release the DNA cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AMT-130 DNA becomes a permanent addition to the neuron. It contains a set of instructions for making a molecule of RNA which has been designed to bind to the RNA which is produced when a cell is making the huntingtin protein. When AMT-130 RNA binds to the cell’s own huntingtin RNA, it summons an enzyme to destroy it. As a result, the huntingtin message is deleted and less of the protein is made – permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GENIUS GENETICS&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Infant With Incurable Disease is First to Successfully Receive Personalized Gene Therapy Treatment" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/infant-with-incurable-disease-is-first-to-successfully-receive-personalized-gene-therapy-treatment/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Infant With Incurable Disease is First to Successfully Receive Personalized Gene Therapy Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neurosurgeries for the UK arm of the trial were conducted at the University Hospital Wales at Cardiff University, and funded by Health and Care Research Wales. The trial results will be presented formally in the US at the HD Clinical Research Congress next month in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;

Neuroscientists now believe it’s a normal brain glitch tied to how memory and perception interact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show that brief electrical discharges in the temporal lobe and hippocampus can evoke this sensation, similar to what occurs in mild epilepsy. Psychologists also link déjà vu to unconscious processing of familiar patterns, where the brain notices details we don’t consciously register, creating a false sense of familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Mix-Up:&lt;/strong&gt; Déjà vu likely arises when the brain mistakenly flags a new experience as familiar due to overlapping memory circuits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Basis:&lt;/strong&gt; The phenomenon is associated with activity in the hippocampus and frontal brain regions responsible for memory conflict detection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subconscious Signals:&lt;/strong&gt; Subtle sensory cues can trigger déjà vu when the brain unconsciously processes information it cannot fully identify.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever get that peculiar feeling that what you’re doing or seeing has already happened, even when you’re pretty sure it hasn’t?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That abrupt and acute sense of familiarity – however improbable – is a phenomenon known as déjà vu, the French phrase for “already seen”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Déjà vu feels so strange and uncanny that popular culture has associated it with everything from time travel to glitches in “The Matrix”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But déjà vu is not a sign that you can see into your past life or travel to an alternate dimension, it’s part of how the brain works, says Professor Sam Berkovic, a clinical neurologist and director of the Epilepsy Research Centre at Austin Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a normal phenomenon. And when you ask people, about 60 to 70 per cent will say they get it,” he says. “I get it every now and again. You kind of shake your head and say, ‘Oh, it’s my brain playing tricks on me’, which is exactly what it is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ephemeral nature of déjà vu makes it hard to study, so scientists aren’t exactly sure what causes it. Some researchers attribute it to discrepancies or errors in parts of the brain that control memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Berkovic says researchers have learned a lot about how the brain works by studying patients who have epileptic seizures, which occur when there’s an abnormal electrical discharge in part of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with epilepsy can sometimes experience a heightened and extreme feeling of déjà vu at the onset of a seizure. This is often an indication of a discharge in the hippocampus, a structure deep in the temporal lobe and the part of the brain beneath the temples that controls memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the déjà vu experienced by a person with epilepsy is longer and more intense than so-called physiological déjà vu, or everyday déjà vu in people without epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s all-encompassing. They are absolutely convinced that they are experiencing something that’s happened before,” says Professor Berkovic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have actually stimulated that part of the brain in patients with epilepsy to replicate those intense feelings of déjà vu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t really know why it happens in healthy people because we’ve never stuck electrodes in the brains of healthy people,” he adds. “But it could be that similar discharges can evoke the same feelings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Berkovic says déjà vu is considered so normal that when he and his PhD student Dr Piero Perucca studied relatives of people with a mild form of epilepsy, they found that they experienced an increased frequency of intense déjà vu that could be considered epileptic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These relatives never thought to complain to their doctors about it because they did not think it was abnormal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Piers Howe, in the Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, links déjà vu to the feeling of having a “sixth sense”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are rather ill-defined terms, and they are not scientific, but a lot of people use them to mean that they sense something going on, although they can’t see it or describe it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Howe decided to look closely at this confounding feeling when a student approached him with a strange experience she described as a sixth sense. The student had recently met a friend that she hadn’t seen in a while, and thought immediately he had been in a car accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’d completely recovered, and there was no visible clue, but my student just knew he had been in an accident. And she was right,” Professor Howe says. “She thought she had a mystical property and wanted me to confirm it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fleeting memories or sensations can be difficult to replicate in a laboratory. But Professor Howe and his student Margaret Webb thought they could mimic this student’s mystical experience by showing people similar photographs of the same person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each photograph would show the subject looking slightly different, whether it was a new pair of earrings or a different lipstick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Participants needed to indicate whether they thought a change had occurred and what it was,” Professor Howe says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “What we found is that people were actually very good at identifying changes they couldn’t localise or describe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They would say, ‘I know something’s changed, I just don’t know what it is’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is likely, then, that the student who had claimed to have a sixth sense had unconsciously noticed subtle information about her friend that led her to believe, correctly, that he had been in a car accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Howe has run a number of similar experiments, all of which indicated that when people look at something, they process far more information than they think they do. They may have been consciously aware of only two or three features of someone’s face, but their brain has noticed much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same kind of process may be happening when someone experiences déjà vu. Something you see or hear may have triggered an eerie feeling of familiarity; you just can’t pinpoint where the memory comes from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our visual memory is not based just on memorising two or three objects in a scene, it’s also picking up on the summative statistics of the rest of the scene,” Professor Howe says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What people might claim as déjà vu or a sixth sense is what you’ve picked up from one of your senses. You just don’t know you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That information comes to you as a sensation that something has happened or will happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Howe says his findings are closely related to studies on déjà vu that have attempted to spark false memories in people by showing them a list of related words, such as door, pane and glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, when participants are shown a word that is related to the words that they have studied, for example, the word “window”, it feels familiar to them so they believe (incorrectly) that they have seen it before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like in the experiments conducted by Professor Howe, this form of déjà vu is caused by the brain picking up more information than which the person is consciously aware. The sense of familiarity is cause by the brain subconsciously determining that the word “window” is semantically related to the words on the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akira O’Connor, a psychology lecturer at the University of St Andrews in the UK, conducted such a study in 2016. He then used MRI scans to see what was happening in participants’ brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He found that the déjà vu experience activated the frontal regions of the brain responsible for memory conflict – or checking through our memories. He concluded that déjà vu might be the result of the brain trying to resolve an error between what you think you have seen before and what you are actually seeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the next time you feel like you’re in a real-life Groundhog Day, remember that your brain is behaving normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain is very complex,” Professor Berkovic says. “And déjà vu is your brain behaving in its very complicated way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759697865097"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Is déjà vu a sign of something supernatural or psychic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; No. It’s a common cognitive event that occurs when memory and perception briefly misfire, not evidence of past lives or premonitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759697879599"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What part of the brain is responsible for déjà vu?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The hippocampus and surrounding temporal lobe structures—especially regions tied to memory formation and familiarity—play key roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759697897973"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why do people with epilepsy experience stronger déjà vu?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Seizure activity in memory-related areas can amplify the sensation, making it more vivid and prolonged than everyday déjà vu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kate Stanton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unimelb.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Melbourne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kate Stanton – University of Melbourne&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2025 20:58:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE9VS2NwMjV5UEJTbWpUMmRPOGxmVWJmaldLU0lmRzFGSFVjM0pHZHM2YjJaOEdXeGdQaDFGMUpvY0ZjYVhUNXk3UUhXcElCNms2Mm9mclFMUXd2ZDQ0TGhBc2NSa25oYjdGRC1MNHV5UmE</guid></item><item><title>从减少炎症到高血糖：睡前吃一小撮肉桂的6个原因-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/from-reducing-inflammation-to-high-blood-sugar-6-reasons-to-have-a-pinch-of-cinnamon-before-bedtime/photostory/124322661.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cinnamon has long been used in kitchens and traditional medicine, but more recently researchers have been looking at how this spice might influence health when taken regularly in small amounts.

Participants with high misophonia severity struggled to shift between emotional tasks and reported rigid thinking in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition was also strongly associated with rumination, or repetitive negative thinking, which may drive or exacerbate distress. These findings suggest that misophonia is more than sensory—it involves deeper issues of emotion regulation and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switching Difficulty:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals with misophonia showed reduced accuracy in tasks requiring emotional set-shifting, even when reaction times were unaffected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Inflexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Self-reported cognitive rigidity was significantly correlated with misophonia, independent of depression, anxiety, and hyperacusis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rumination Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Multiple forms of rumination—general, brooding, and anger—were strongly associated with misophonia severity and mediated the link with cognitive inflexibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=misophonia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Misophonia&lt;/a&gt;, the intense emotional response to everyday sounds like chewing or sniffing, has long been viewed as a sensory condition. But new research reveals it may run much deeper—tied not just to sound sensitivity, but to how the brain regulates emotion, attention, and thought.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new pre-registered study has found that individuals with misophonia not only struggle with emotional reactivity to triggering sounds, but also exhibit significant impairments in both&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=cognitive+flexibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; cognitive and &lt;em&gt;affective flexibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—the brain’s ability to shift focus, regulate emotional response, and move between mental tasks in the face of emotionally charged stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that this rigidity is closely linked to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/?s=rumination" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;rumination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a repetitive pattern of negative thinking seen in many forms of mental distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings offer a crucial window into misophonia’s cognitive profile, highlighting that what’s often assumed to be “just” a reaction to sound may in fact involve broader, transdiagnostic processes of emotional regulation and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beyond the Sound: The Brain’s Role in Misophonia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misophonia, affecting an estimated 5% to 20% of the population, is characterized by extreme discomfort or even rage triggered by specific sounds, often involving orofacial human noises (like chewing or throat-clearing). Though not yet listed in the DSM-5 or ICD-11, misophonia is increasingly recognized as a condition with serious life impacts—ranging from social avoidance to workplace difficulties and emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, until now, misophonia has largely been approached through the lens of auditory processing or sensory hypersensitivity. What this new study reveals is that underlying cognitive and emotional traits—namely &lt;em&gt;inflexibility&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rumination&lt;/em&gt;—may be critical in shaping misophonic responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the &lt;em&gt;Memory and Affective Flexibility Task (MAFT)&lt;/em&gt;, a novel neurocognitive paradigm designed to measure how participants shift between memory-based and emotionally driven tasks. Unlike traditional tasks that use neutral stimuli, the MAFT incorporates emotionally evocative images to better capture real-world emotional demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Affective Flexibility and the Cost of Switching&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the core findings was that individuals with clinically significant misophonia showed &lt;em&gt;reduced affective flexibility&lt;/em&gt;. Specifically, participants with higher misophonia severity performed worse on switch trials where they had to rapidly shift from one emotional evaluation to another—such as reappraising whether an image was emotionally positive or negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This difficulty wasn’t simply about slow reaction times; in fact, reaction time was not correlated with misophonia severity. Instead, the impairment was in &lt;em&gt;switch accuracy&lt;/em&gt;—indicating a breakdown in the ability to shift cognitive sets in response to emotionally salient stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these flexibility deficits persisted even after controlling for general cognitive rigidity, anxiety, depression, and hyperacusis, suggesting a specific and independent role for &lt;em&gt;affective switching&lt;/em&gt; in misophonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cognitive Inflexibility and Broader Mental Rigidity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside behavioral task data, participants also completed the &lt;em&gt;Detail and Flexibility Questionnaire (DFlex)&lt;/em&gt;—a validated self-report measure of cognitive flexibility. Here too, the results were striking: misophonia severity was &lt;em&gt;strongly and positively associated&lt;/em&gt; with cognitive inflexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, individuals with misophonia not only struggled with moment-to-moment emotional shifts in a lab task—they also reported a &lt;em&gt;trait-like&lt;/em&gt; rigidity in daily life. These patterns mirror cognitive difficulties seen in disorders commonly comorbid with misophonia, such as OCD, autism spectrum disorder, and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, affective flexibility and cognitive flexibility did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; correlate with one another, reinforcing the idea that they are distinct processes—each contributing independently to the misophonic experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rumination: The Mental Loop That Won’t Stop&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If affective inflexibility reflects difficulty shifting emotional gears, &lt;em&gt;rumination&lt;/em&gt; is the cognitive trap that keeps people stuck. Defined as repetitive, negative self-focused thought, rumination has long been implicated in depression and anxiety—but this study shows its unique relevance to misophonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed three different rumination scales, measuring general perseverative thinking, brooding, and anger rumination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three forms were significantly correlated with misophonia severity—even after controlling for anxiety and depression—suggesting that rumination is not merely a comorbid feature but a potential cognitive driver of misophonic distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, rumination did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; correlate with affective flexibility (as measured by MAFT), but did strongly correlate with cognitive inflexibility—suggesting a shared underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mediation analysis revealed that up to 43% of the link between cognitive inflexibility and misophonia could be explained by rumination, pointing to it as a key cognitive mediator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Clinical Implications: More Than Sound Sensitivity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study offers a critical reframing of misophonia: not merely as a sensory disorder, but as a condition shaped by fundamental patterns of attention, flexibility, and emotion regulation. The findings raise important questions about how we classify and treat misophonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic interventions targeting cognitive flexibility and rumination—such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based approaches, and metacognitive training—may hold promise for reducing misophonic distress. These methods could help individuals shift away from rigid thought patterns and develop greater emotional adaptability in the face of sensory triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also emphasizes the need for clinicians to assess for broader executive function difficulties and ruminative tendencies in patients reporting misophonic symptoms. Understanding this broader cognitive-affective profile may help prevent misdiagnosis and enable more tailored interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Toward a New Understanding of Misophonia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By integrating behavioral tasks, self-report measures, and a robust pre-registered design, this study offers one of the most comprehensive looks yet at the cognitive underpinnings of misophonia. The evidence is clear: misophonia involves more than ears—it involves how the brain reacts, regulates, and &lt;em&gt;ruminates&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should further explore these mechanisms using longitudinal designs and clinical samples, as well as investigate whether treating cognitive inflexibility and rumination can reduce symptoms over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who live with misophonia, these findings may bring hope: not just for understanding, but for interventions that go beyond silencing the world—to helping the mind &lt;em&gt;let go&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759694517837"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What is misophonia, and how is it usually understood?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Misophonia is a condition where specific sounds trigger intense emotional responses, such as irritation, anxiety, or rage—most often viewed as a sensory processing issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759694538120"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What new insights does this study provide about misophonia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: The study reveals that misophonia is also characterized by difficulty switching between emotional tasks, rigid thinking patterns, and high levels of rumination, suggesting a broader cognitive-emotional basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759694553423"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How could these findings impact treatment for misophonia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Targeting rumination and mental inflexibility through cognitive-behavioral or mindfulness-based therapies may help reduce misophonic distress and improve emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this misophonia and cognitive neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/about-neuroscience-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/bjop.70025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Misophonia symptom severity is linked to impaired flexibility and heightened rumination&lt;/a&gt;” by Vivien K.

&lt;p data-start="256" data-end="476"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="256" data-end="286"&gt;PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY, Va.&lt;/strong&gt; — Prince William County Public Schools confirmed Sunday that Candis King, a 10th-grade student at Colgan High School and daughter of Virginia Delegate Candi Mundon King, has died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="478" data-end="679"&gt;In a letter sent to Colgan families on Sunday, Principal Tim Healey informed parents of the student’s death. He said the school community would receive counseling and emotional support this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="683" data-end="1076"&gt;“I am saddened to share that Candis King, one of our 10th-grade students, passed away over the weekend,” Healey wrote. “We are working with Candis’ family to provide any needed support. There will be a Critical Incident Team at the school tomorrow. Additionally, there are resources here at school available for both staff members and students who need support in coping with their sadness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1078" data-end="1285"&gt;Healey encouraged families to talk openly with their children about grief and to watch for signs that they may be struggling emotionally. Counselors will visit each of Candis’ classes on Monday, October 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1289" data-end="1450"&gt;“This is a difficult time for our school community, but Colgan High School students and staff will support each other as we deal with this loss,” Healey wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1452" data-end="1857"&gt;Candis King was the daughter of Delegate Candi Mundon King (D–23rd District), who represents portions of Prince William and Stafford counties in the Virginia House of Delegates. King shared publicly last month that her daughter had been battling sickle cell disease, describing her as a “sickle cell warrior” who had spent much of Sickle Cell Awareness Month in and out of hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1861" data-end="2040"&gt;“SC continues to find new ways to inflict pain upon my baby. Indescribable pain,” King wrote in a September post on X, formerly Twitter. “But she is strong, and so is her mama.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2042" data-end="2171"&gt;Several lawmakers, including Delegate Geary Higgins (R-Loudoun), responded at the time with messages of prayer and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2173" data-end="2409"&gt;Colgan High School’s band and performing arts program, where Candis was reportedly active, is among those recently recognized statewide with the Virginia Music Educators Association’s Blue Ribbon Award for Excellence in Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2411" data-end="2703"&gt;King, first elected in 2021, serves on the Counties, Cities, and Towns, Public Safety, and Labor and Commerce committees in the House of Delegates. She is a graduate of Norfolk State University and has been an outspoken advocate for families affected by sickle cell disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2705" data-end="2759"&gt;She and her husband, Josh King, have three children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2761" data-end="2854"&gt;This is a developing story and will be updated as additional information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not all protein bars are healthy—the best ones provide at least 12 grams of protein, minimal added sugar, and simple, whole food ingredients rather than additives or preservatives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Different types suit different needs, from nut- and seed-based bars packed with healthy fats, to whey or egg white bars that deliver complete proteins, to vegan-friendly plant protein options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smart shopping matters—look for short ingredient lists, at least 3 grams of fiber, and no more than 10 grams of added sugar per serving to ensure your bar supports energy, satiety, and overall health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/dietitian-favorite-sources-of-protein-11820661" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Protein&lt;/a&gt; remains incredibly popular within the health-focused community, leading to a booming protein-based product market—one of the most notable being the humble protein bar. Consumers reach for these bars as a snack, workout fuel, or even meal replacement (though that’s not recommended). “Protein bars are best used as a convenient snack, not a replacement for balanced meals. Whole foods should still be the foundation, with bars stepping in when you need something quick, portable, and reliable,” explains Stephanie Militano, MS, RD, CSSD, sports dietitian and owner of SM Nutrition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In turn, the world of protein bars has become nothing short of overwhelming. In fact, the market is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; saturated with options that you could try a new brand every day for an impressively long time. However, these convenience items can be incredibly deceiving when it comes to perceived health benefits. Some deliver what they advertise—clean protein with minimal unwanted ingredients—while others are no more than a glorified candy bar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here, we’ll explore what makes one protein bar more or less healthy than the next, and highlight five &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; nutritious options to look for on your next grocery store run.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-makes-a-protein-bar-healthy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Makes a Protein Bar Healthy? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As with many packaged foods, the key to determining a protein bar's healthfulness (or lack thereof) lies in the &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/red-flags-on-food-labels-8781749" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrition facts panel and ingredients list&lt;/a&gt;. In protein bars, you primarily want to check for protein, fiber, and whole food-based ingredients—as well as fat sources, added sugar, additives, preservatives, and artificial ingredients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; First, you (of course) want to check how much protein the bar contains. This macro helps us feel full after eating, stabilizes blood sugars, and supports the maintenance, growth, and repair of most tissues in the body&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;—most notably muscle—among many other important benefits. “Aim for at least 12 grams of protein per bar. If using it as a meal replacement or post-workout recovery, choose bars closer to 20 grams,” shares Jessica Clancy-Strawn MA, RDN, media and kidney wellness dietitian in Houston, Texas. Ideally the protein source of your protein bar will be whole food-based—like from &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-nuts-to-eat-11686130" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt;, seeds, legumes, dairy, or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/healthy-egg-recipes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Then, there are a few “nice to have” nutrients and ingredients in protein bars—namely &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; and/or fruits and veggies. Fiber offers similar metabolic benefits as protein&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, boosting satiety after eating and managing the blood sugar response. However, it’s also tied to improved digestive regularity, cholesterol levels, and gut health as a prebiotic (or food for healthy bacteria) in the gut microbiome&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;—which supports several other elements of health like immune&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and brain health&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Three grams (or more) of fiber per bar is a major added bonus. Meanwhile, fruit and veggies add micronutrients like vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds to your protein bar for overall health support.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Paying attention to the type of fat found in your protein bar is also important. “Favor &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy fats&lt;/a&gt; such as polyunsaturated, monounsaturated, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-with-more-omega-3s-than-salmon-11784373" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;omega-3&lt;/a&gt; and -6 fatty acids from sources like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/olive-oil-health-benefits-8754789" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt;, nuts, and seeds. Avoid saturated&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and trans fats&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, especially those from partially hydrogenated or refined vegetable oils, which are not heart-friendly,” explains Clancy-Strawn. Zero grams of trans fat and three grams or less of saturated fat per bar is ideal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Then, when it comes to other ingredients to be wary of, be on the look out for added sugar, additives, preservatives, or artificial ingredients. “Choose bars with short, recognizable ingredient lists. Avoid preservatives and additives—especially risky ones like erythritol, carrageenan, soy lecithin, and potassium sorbate,” shares Clancy-Strawn, as these additives have been linked with stomach upset&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, unwanted heart health events&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/signs-of-inflammation-7565179" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and fatigue&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Plus, many additives and preservatives, while technically deemed safe for consumption, lack the long-term research&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; needed to truly gauge their health implications. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meanwhile, added sugar is a major pro-inflammatory agent&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the body that can be found in high amounts in certain protein bars. “Opt for bars with 10 grams or less of added sugars. Lower sugar and higher fiber content help manage blood sugar spikes and crashes, and support sustained appetite control,” adds Clancy-Strawn. “Non-nutritive naturally-occurring sweeteners, such as stevia or monk fruit sweetener are better options to look for in a protein bar,” Maura Fowler, MPH RDN CPH, registered dietitian and founder of Healthy You by Maura notes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, many allergens can be found in protein bars—like nuts, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-seeds-11688836" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt;, and dairy (or dairy-based components like whey and casein). If you or your loved ones have any food allergies or sensitivities, it’s important to carefully examine the food label and allergen statement prior to investing in a new protein bar option.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-healthiest-protein-bars"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Healthiest Protein Bars  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thankfully, there are plenty of protein bar categories that meet these criteria. Here are five of the top better-for-you options:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Primarily Nut, Seed, or Nut-Butter Based Bars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I always want to encourage protein that comes from whole foods first,” says Fowler—and nut and nut butter-based protein bars definitely fit this bill. Plus, these bars often provide additional nutrients like fiber, healthy fats, and a variety of micronutrients naturally found in the nuts, seeds, and their butters. “Nuts and seeds offer numerous health benefits&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, including improved cardiovascular health and reduced risk of cancer, respiratory illness, infectious disease, and diabetes,” Clancy-Strawn adds. There are plenty of brands that offer nut, seed, or nut/seed butter-based bars. “A few of my favorite brands are Kind Bars and Larabar,” shares Militano.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Allergen-Free Bars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For those allergic to any (or several) of the nine major allergens, there are a handful of allergen-free protein bars available. “It’s always important to be mindful of individuals who have allergies, and provide adequate options for those folks too. 88 Acres and Alio are made with simple ingredients and are free of all nine allergens,” says Fowler When searching for these bars, it’s essential to double check the food label and allergen statement before serving them to another with severe allergies or sensitivities.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Whey Protein-Based Bars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Whey protein-based bars contain all of the essential amino acids, which make them a great choice if you are trying to support muscle health—and they are also typically &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-that-have-the-most-protein-8763731" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;higher in protein&lt;/a&gt;,” says Militano. Fowler agrees, adding, “Whey protein continues to prove it’s an ultimate source of protein that your body can better absorb&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.” Many of the protein bars that you’ll find in grocery stores fit within this category. “Rise bars are great options that feature simple ingredients including &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health-benefits-of-cashews-7110031" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cashews&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/almonds-health-benefits-6835790" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;almonds&lt;/a&gt;, or sunflower seeds, and natural sweeteners. They contain no hazardous additives, offer 16 grams of protein, a good amount of fruits and vegetables, and are low in sodium and saturated fat,” shares Clancy-Strawn.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Plant Protein-Based Bars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have dairy sensitivities or follow a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/easy-vegan-recipes" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based diet&lt;/a&gt;, vegan protein bars are a smart grab. “For those who prefer dairy free or a vegan/vegetarian lifestyle, these are their bars,” Fowler encourages. And there are plenty of brands offering exceptional plant-based protein bars. “Known for being gluten-free, dairy-free, seed oil-free, and free of sugar alcohols, Trubar was established in 2019 and is widely available at Target,” explains Clancy-Strawn. “Think! Plant Based Protein Bars are also low in added sugar, only 190 calories, and have minimal saturated fats,” Fowler adds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Egg Protein-Based Bars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Similar to whey-based protein bars, options that garner their protein power from eggs also offer all nine essential amino acids for a complete protein snack. Most of these bars use &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/egg-white-nutrition" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;egg whites&lt;/a&gt; as a protein source, which conveniently adds protein without affecting the flavor or texture. When it comes to brands to keep an eye out for within this category, Clancy-Strawn offers, “simplicity at its finest, RXBARs feature nuts, natural flavors, egg whites, and dates, with the ingredient list proudly displayed on the front.” &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-healthy-protein-bar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look for in a Healthy Protein Bar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While these protein bar varieties and brands are a great starting point for finding healthy options, they only scratch the surface of what's available in grocery stores nationwide. To uncover other nutritious choices, keep the following guidelines in mind:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Look for protein content of at least 12 grams per bar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fiber content of at least three grams per bar is a nice bonus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose options with whole food, recognizable ingredients &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim for bars with zero grams of trans fat and three grams or less of saturated fat per serving&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The shorter the ingredient list, the better. Select options with ingredients you recognize and can pronounce over bars with high amounts of additives and preservatives&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be sure there’s no more than 10 grams of added sugar in the protein bar you purchase&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you or your loved one has food allergies, be sure to thoroughly examine the ingredients list and allergen statement to avoid those triggering foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
