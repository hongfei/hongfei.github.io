 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Two MRI scans showing a person (left) with more visceral fat (in red) and subcutaeous fat (in blue)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The UK researchers measured the 'bad' fat around their organs by doing several MRI scans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This lower-body fat may even help guard against heart disease, strokes and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found that higher oestrogen levels in premenopausal women were linked to slower heart ageing—suggesting the hormone could play a protective role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To reach their conclusions, scientists at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Medical Sciences in London analysed MRI scans from participants in the UK Biobank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whole-body images were used to map the amount and location of fat, while detailed scans of the heart and blood vessels were assessed with artificial intelligence to detect signs of ageing—such as tissue becoming stiff or inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each participant was then given a 'heart age', which researchers compared with their actual age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Professor Declan O'Regan, from Imperial College London, said: 'We have known about the apple and pear distinction in body fat, but it hasn't been clear how it leads to poor health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our research shows that 'bad' fat, hidden deep around the organs, accelerates ageing of the heart. But some types of fat could protect against ageing—specifically fat around the hips and thighs in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We also showed that BMI wasn't a good way of predicting heart age which underscores the importance of knowing where fat is stored in the body and not just total body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While some warning signs are easy to spot, such as severe chest pain, others are more vague and hard to pinpoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The goal of our research is to find ways to increase healthy lifespan. While being active is important, we found that hidden fat could still be harmful even in fit people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His team now plans to investigate whether new weight-loss jabs such as Ozempic can target the ageing effects of this hidden fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs, which mimic the hunger-suppressing hormone GLP-1, have already been shown to cut levels of dangerous visceral fat—and could one day help keep the heart younger for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation added: 'We already know excess visceral fat around the heart and liver can lead to increased blood pressure and high cholesterol, so it is concerning that it could also help to speed up ageing of the heart and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As the pattern of fat distribution typically seen in women's bodies is linked to oestrogen, that hormone may be key to future therapies developed to tackle heart ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Eating a healthier diet and becoming more active can help to reduce visceral fat levels.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this summer, US &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14955169/heart-ageing-faster-body-test.html"&gt;researchers &lt;/a&gt;developed a free online &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nwkhanlab.shinyapps.io/riskage/"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt; that they claim can help you calculate if your heart is aging faster than the rest of your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By utilising data provided by the American Heart Association it can help you better understand how much stress your heart is under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It asks you to enter your sex, age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, whether or not you have diabetes, and if you take medication for blood pressure or statins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also requires you to input your eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) which is used to measure how well your kidneys are functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The age calculator was tested on more than 14,000 US adults between the ages of 30 and 79 from the year 2011 up until 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s a type of cancer that develops in the tissues of the colon or rectum. It starts in the large intestine (colon) and often develops from small, noncancerous clumps of cells called polyps. It's one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Thanks to obesity and alcohol consumption, bowel cancer has become the primary cause of the rising death toll among young adults. It is getting increasingly common, especially among younger adults. In recent years, doctors have witnessed a disturbing trend linked with colon cancer, which traditionally is viewed as a disease of older adults, but is increasingly striking people under 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, new research offers a hopeful twist toward the prevention of this type of cancer: adding just 40 to 60 grams daily of cruciferous vegetables can reduce colon cancer risk by 20-26%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Five Effective Ways to Detoxify Your Gut Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the research say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large review &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcgastroenterol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12876-025-04163-9" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;published in BMC Gastroenterology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; analyzed nearly 640,000 individuals and highlights how a simple dietary habit (think of including a few vegetables in your regular diet) could deliver big preventive benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers reviewed 17 large studies, involving over 639,500 people, among whom 97,595 had colorectal cancer. The results? People consuming the highest amounts of cruciferous vegetables (think broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, and Brussels sprouts) had a 20-26% lower risk of colorectal cancer compared to those eating the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that consuming around 40-60 grams daily was associated with a 20% lower risk of colon cancer. However, benefits plateaued beyond 60 grams; so more isn't necessarily better. These vegetables are rich in phytochemicals such as flavonoids, fiber, vitamin C, carotenoids, and glucosinolates, which break down into protective agents like sulforaphane when crushed or chewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why (and how) these vegetables work against colon cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruciferous vegetables are nutritional powerhouses packed with fiber, vitamin C, carotenoids, and flavonoids. But their true anti-cancer star is sulforaphane, a compound produced when these veggies are chopped or chewed. Sulforaphane and related compounds called glucosinolates kickstart the body’s detox systems, reduce inflammation, and repair cellular damage – key elements in cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to the broader picture, other research supports different parts of the plant-based diet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plant-based dietary patterns overall showed a 46% reduced risk of colon cancer and 73% lower risk of rectal cancer in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jhpn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41043-024-00605-4" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as per the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aicr.org/resources/blog/ask-the-dietitian-get-your-facts-right-on-fiber-and-whole-grains/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Institute for Cancer Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, whole grains may lower colorectal cancer risk by around 17%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to add broccoli to your daily diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broccoli, amongst all cruciferous vegetables, is a nutritional powerhouse, offering a wide range of health benefits due to its rich content of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. Apart from potentially helping with cancer prevention, broccoli may help with heart health and digestive health, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some simple ideas on how to incorporate cruciferous vegetables into your regular diet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Aim for 40-60g daily:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Roughly half a cup of chopped broccoli or its equivalent of cruciferous veggies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Cook smartly:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Light steaming preserves key compounds like sulforaphane while enhancing absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Add color and variety:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rotate among broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and kale for broader benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Pair with a balanced diet:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Focus on whole grains, pulses, and fruits while reducing red and processed meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Stay consistent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; These are preventive strategies best practiced daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you’re looking to add some goodness to all your meals, then you can consider stirring steamed broccoli into omelets or scrambled eggs for breakfast, or tossing chopped cabbage or kale into salads or wraps for lunch. For dinner, think of adding cauliflower florets to stir-fries or pasta dishes. In fact, you can also build a healthy snacking habit by munching on roasted Brussels sprouts or kale chips. Aiming for half a cup daily means just one thoughtful inclusion per meal. That small shift can be a big deal for your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, no food is a magic cure, but adding more cruciferous vegetables to your plate, especially in the range of 40-60 grams daily, can significantly reduce your colorectal cancer risk by around 20%. Combined with other healthy habits, such as screening, exercise, and a rich variety of plant-based foods, you’re setting yourself up for stronger, more vital living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember: Every chopped floret counts. A little broccoli today could go a long way toward a healthier tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Study shows new links between high fat diets, colon cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>科学支持的“内疚快乐” ，可降低糖尿病、癌症、心脏病甚至死亡的风险-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dark chocolate and red wine don’t have to be guilty pleasures.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dark chocolate and red wine are just two examples of high-flavonoid foods that can be part of a healthy diet and should be consumed along with other flavonoid-rich foods and beverages, such as tea, apples, berries, oranges and grapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with chronic inflammatory illnesses like obesity stand to benefit the most from a varied, high-flavonoid diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When consumed through food, flavonoids have essentially no risk of negative effects. Flavonoid toxicity is only possible by taking too many high-potency supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-025-01176-1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal Nature, tracked diets using information from the UK biobank, a large, population-based cohort study that records biological data over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants filled out the Oxford WebQ 24-hour dietary questionnaire up to five times over the course of three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers then compared that data with the dates and causes of participants’ deaths and hospital admissions to determine the relationship between their diets and their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found people who consumed the widest variety of flavonoids, characterized as consuming an additional 6.7 flavonoid types per day, had a 14 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 10 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also had a 20 percent reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and an eight percent lower risk of cancer when compared to those who ate the lowest variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But quantity is still important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Red wine is a date night staple, but it's also one of the richest sources of flavonoids (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in the study who consumed about 500mg of flavonoids per day had a 16 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Risk of cardiovascular disease was reduced by nine percent; type 2 diabetes reduced by 12 percent; and respiratory disease reduced by 13 percent when compared to people who ate just 230 mg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Flavonoid intake of around 500 milligrams a day was associated with a 16 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality,’ according to Dr Parmenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘That's roughly the amount of flavonoids that you would consume in two cups of tea,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 5oz glass of red wine on average contains about 130 milligrams of flavonoids. A bar of dark chocolate can contain anywhere from 200 milligrams to 1,000 milligrams depending on the size, manufacturer and cacao percentage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the sources of flavonoids participants consumed during the study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the effects of flavonoids on several health conditions and mortality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Take note, however, to not eat too much chocolate or wine due to their high calorie counts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 100g bar of 70 to 85 percent dark chocolate contains about 600 calories, and a 5oz glass of wine has around 120 calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A high-flavonoid meal plan could include a cup of tea in the morning with some fruits like apples and berries for breakfast, followed by dark chocolate for dessert at lunch and a glass of red wine with dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Aedín Cassidy, study co-author, said: ‘The results provide a clear public health message, suggesting that simple and achievable dietary swaps, such as drinking more tea and eating more berries and apples for example, can help increase the variety and intake of flavonoid-rich foods, and potentially improve health in the long-term.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But when they reduced its levels in older mice, their cognitive performance was boosted to levels seen in much younger mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The protein is believed to disrupt energy production within cells, essentially starving neurons of the power needed to form and store memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;FTL1 is linked to normal, age-related memory decline, which includes common cognitive changes that affect nearly everyone as they get older, even without a disease like &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-93060890-7eb2-11f0-b35e-f1b04a526a83"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;. Focusing on this protein represents a much larger segment of the aging population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Saul Villeda, associate director of the UCSF Bakar Aging Research Institute and senior author of the paper, said: ‘It is truly a reversal of impairments. It’s much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Understanding how aging alters brain cells and molecules is crucial to explaining why some people develop neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and other &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13907587/common-injury-increase-dementia-risk-study.html"&gt;forms of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between six and 12 million Americans 65 and up have been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to dementia. About a third of those people develop Alzheimer’s disease within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Rebecca, a 48-year-old single mom, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's after debilitating cognitive symptoms upended her life &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco discovered that a protein known as ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) builds up in the brain's memory hub of aging mice (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using specialized genetic tools and viruses, the scientists either increased or decreased the levels of the FTL1 protein - which is part of the body's system that stores iron in cells - in the mice's brains, specifically in the brain’s memory center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They put the mice through various memory and learning tests, such as mazes and recognizing new objects, to see how these changes affected their cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the tests, they examined the mouse brain tissue under microscopes, counting how many connections between brain cells were lost or regained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They then measured if the brain cells were generating enough energy to function properly and used dyes to see how iron was being stored in the brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that levels of the FTL1 protein were significantly higher in the memory center of old mice compared to young mice. The higher the FTL1 levels in old mice, the worse they performed on memory tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When scientists artificially increased FTL1 in young, healthy mice, it made them forgetful. They performed just as poorly on memory tests as old mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when they reduced FTL1 levels in old, forgetful mice, their memory dramatically improved. They started performing like young mice again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Repeat experiments proved their results were not a fluke. Multiple trial rounds, using different genetic approaches to reduce FTL1, consistently produced the same outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They published their findings in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00940-z#Sec2"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An estimated 6 to 12 million Americans aged 65 and older have mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Approximately one-third of these individuals will progress to Alzheimer's dementia within a five-year period (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the findings are promising, the authors cautioned that the research was conducted only in male mice and that human applications remain in the distance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A process that successfully reverses memory decline in a mouse's brain may not work the same way, or at all, in the far more complex human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dementia research has traditionally centered on beta-amyloid and tau proteins, which are known to accumulate in the brain and form clumps and tangles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The harmful buildup of proteins is exacerbated as the aging brain loses its natural ability to dispose of metabolic waste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This research significantly broadens the potential pool of people who could benefit from the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amyloid and Tau research primarily aims to treat or prevent Alzheimer's disease, but not everyone who ages will get Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But for thousands of people today, the reality of cognitive decline is a present and devastating diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rebecca, a 48-year-old single mother from British Columbia, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's after months of debilitating cognitive symptoms that disrupted her daily life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jana Nelson was 50 when diagnosed with early-onset dementia, following severe personality changes and a sharp cognitive decline that left her unable to solve simple math problems or name colors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She experienced severe memory lapses, most notably forgetting names and mid-conversation blackouts where she would suddenly lose her train of thought entirely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The episodes progressed beyond simple forgetfulness to a profound inability to process information, such as opening her work laptop and having 'zero idea how to do my job,' even when looking at her own training notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Jana Nelson's diagnosis of early-onset dementia at age 50 was preceded by severe personality changes, going from a laid-back woman to being short-tempered with extreme, unmanageable mood swings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her cognitive abilities sharply declined, manifesting as an inability to solve simple math problems like calculating change from five dollars or name different colors. She became unsteady on her feet, began to repeat herself, and struggled profoundly with problem-solving tasks and spatial reasoning, such as fitting a key into a shaped hole or drawing a clock face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;FTL1 research aims to address the mechanisms behind the general, age-related memory decline that affects nearly everyone, even younger adults who begin to experience memory lapses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Villeda said: ‘We’re seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age. It’s a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Then after a full menstrual cycle they took a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During both phases they had a special type of brain scan—a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alongside this they self-reported their mood with the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP)—a clinical tool used for assessing menstrual mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood samples showed that hormone levels were suppressed during the oral contraceptive phase, confirming they were working. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The recent study found taking oral contraceptives may lower your brain function's individuality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the researchers analysed the brain scans, they looked at 'functional connectivity'—the way different parts of the brain communicate with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using a new technique known as functional connectome fingerprinting, they were able to see whether each woman's brain activity was distinctive enough to pick her out from the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results showed that while on the pill, participants' brain activity became noticeably more alike, dulling the unique signatures that normally set individuals apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although each brain pattern remained identifiable, the interactions between regions lost some of their distinctiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The effect was strongest in networks linked to executive control (which helps us plan and achieve goals), somatomotor processing (which governs voluntary movements), salience detection (the ability to pick out important details in a scene), and the 'default mode' network—active when the brain is at rest and not focused on a task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In short, the researchers say the pill's impact was not confined to one area but appeared to have a broad dampening effect across the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The women also reported more negative mood symptoms while on the contraceptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These feelings were tied to 13 specific connections between brain regions, including the frontal pole, superior frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus — all key hubs in emotional processing and regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Last year, presenter Davina McCall fronted a Channel 4 documentary, Pill Revolution, highlighting her concerns about the side-effects of the contraceptive pill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

In practice this means sugars are broken down more slowly so food stays in the gut longer and post-meal blood glucose rises less sharply.

					&lt;p&gt;Muscle loss after 45 is a real health issue that can affect mobility, strength, and independence as you age. Known as sarcopenia, the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/how-can-strength-training-build-healthier-bodies-we-age#:~:text=of%20optimal%20health.-,What%20is%20sarcopenia?,the%20odds%20of%20developing%20sarcopenia." target="_blank"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; says this age-related muscle decline begins as early as your 30s and accelerates with each decade. And according to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3276215/" target="_blank"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, you could lose 3 to 8 percent of your muscle mass every decade after the age of 30 without regular resistance training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less muscle mass can impact your &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572145/" target="_blank"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6370503/" target="_blank"&gt;balance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6571089/" target="_blank"&gt;joint health&lt;/a&gt;, and can make everyday tasks like climbing stairs, carrying groceries, or getting up from a chair significantly more challenging. It also &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/48/1/16/5126243" target="_blank"&gt;increases your risk of falls and fractures&lt;/a&gt;, which can lead to a cascade of other health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that muscle loss isn’t inevitable. Regular resistance and functional training (e.g., using your bodyweight, resistance bands, or light weights) can slow down, or in some cases reverse, the natural decline in muscle mass. A 2023 review in the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10579494/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;BMJ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that consistent resistance training can boost muscle size, strength, and function in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with all the conflicting information online, knowing which exercises are best for reversing muscle loss can be tricky. That’s why we spoke with Chris Mohr, PhD, RD, fitness and nutrition advisor at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://barbend.com/experts/chris-mohr-phd-rd/" target="_blank"&gt;BarBend&lt;/a&gt;, who reveals his top five daily exercises for improving strength, balance, and daily function after 45.

&lt;p&gt;Step-ups strengthen the major muscles of your lower body while simultaneously improving single-leg stability, which is essential for fall prevention as you get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Step-ups mimic real-life movement like climbing stairs,” Mohr says. “They work your glutes, quads, and hamstrings while improving balance. Use a sturdy step, press through your heel to rise up, then lower slowly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand facing a sturdy step, bench, or low platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step up with your right foot, pressing firmly through the heel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring your left foot up to meet your right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step down with your right foot, then your left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternate the lead leg each set to keep the work even.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Reps:&lt;/b&gt; 3 sets of 10 reps per leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Start with a low step height for safety, and position it near a wall or railing for balance support if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This throwback to high school gym class has stood the test of time for good reason. Wall sits target your quads, glutes, and hamstrings to help make activities like walking, standing, and stair climbing easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohr explains, “Wall sits build lower body endurance and strength without needing equipment. Slide down a wall until your knees are at 90 degrees and hold. Start with 30 seconds, build up to a minute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with your back against a wall, feet hip-width apart and about two feet from the wall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slide down until your knees are bent at roughly 90 degrees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your back flat against the wall and your core engaged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold for the prescribed time without letting your knees cave inward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Time:&lt;/b&gt; Start with 30 seconds, work up to one minute. Do 3 rounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; If a full 90-degree bend feels uncomfortable, adjust to a higher position while still feeling your muscles engage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This push-up variation is a joint-friendly move for building upper body strength without going all the way to the floor. They’re a total upper body muscle mass booster, targeting your chest, triceps, shoulders, and core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pushups against a bench or counter take pressure off your wrists and shoulders while still targeting your chest, arms, and core,” Mohr says. “Keep your body straight, lower with control, and press back up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand facing a sturdy bench, countertop, or table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your hands on the surface, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step your feet back until your body forms a straight line from head to heels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows and lower your chest toward the surface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your palms to return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Reps:&lt;/b&gt; 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; The lower the surface, the more challenging the move. Start higher and gradually work your way down to increase difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chair-assisted lunges can help increase lower body strength, hip flexibility, and balance. “Hold onto the back of a chair for balance,” Mohr instructs. “Step one leg back and lower into a lunge, then return to standing. This is great for strengthening your legs and hips and helps improve mobility.”&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, holding the back of a sturdy chair for support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step your right foot back and lower your body into a lunge, bending both knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your front knee over your ankle and your torso upright.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push through your front heel to return to standing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat all reps on one leg before switching sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Reps:&lt;/b&gt; 3 sets of 10 reps per leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Start with a shallow lunge and increase depth over time as strength and mobility improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rows are a killer exercise for strengthening your upper back, biceps, and forearms. They can also improve posture, which is essential for lifting, carrying, and keeping the shoulders in a healthy position as you age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohr says, “Use a resistance band anchored securely to a door. Pull the handles toward your ribcage, squeeze your shoulder blades, then release slowly. This strengthens your back and arms, which are often neglected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anchor a resistance band securely to a door or stable object at chest height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the handles or ends of the band with palms facing each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step back to create tension in the band.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull the handles toward your ribcage, squeezing your shoulder blades together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Reps:&lt;/b&gt; 3 sets of 12 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Keep your core engaged throughout the movement to avoid leaning backward.&lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The increase makes sense for this time of year, as people spend more time indoors in air-conditioned spaces or settle back into their fall routines, experts said. Residents are returning from vacation, and students are returning to school, said Andrew Lover, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It doesn’t look particularly worrisome. It’s kind of expected,” Lover said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Over the last few years, the uptick has peaked in late August and lasted until Labor Day, he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;So far, Massachusetts has not been impacted as heavily as other states, including Texas, Nevada, and Utah, which have reached “very high” levels of waste water, according to CDC data from &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Aug. 3 to Aug. 9&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Infectious disease experts are keeping a close eye on the now dominant variant, XFG or &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/coronavirus/2025/08/14/what-to-know-summer-colds-covid-19-variant-stratus/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.boston.com/news/coronavirus/2025/08/14/what-to-know-summer-colds-covid-19-variant-stratus/"&gt;“Stratus”&lt;/a&gt;, which was first identified in Southeast Asia in January.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;According to CDC data, the XFG variant accounts for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-variants.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;65 percent&lt;/a&gt; of virus samples in waste water as of Aug. 9. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It’s hard to tell the extent to which Stratus is affecting Massachusetts, because&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;sequencing — the process that determines the genetic makeup of a virus — has “dropped off” in a lot of places, Lover said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Stratus causes similar symptoms to other COVID-19 variants, including fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, and loss of taste or smell. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The updated COVID vaccines that the Food and Drug Administration approved earlier this year should offer “some pretty decent protection” against Stratus, Lover said. The World Health Organization said “currently approved COVID-19 vaccines are expected to remain effective” against this variant, according to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;a June report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Unlike previous years, however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory committee has yet to issue recommendations for who should receive booster shots this fall. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“One worry, right now, is that vaccine uptake may be suboptimal relative to prior years,” Lover said. “We’ll have to see what comes out in the next few weeks.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;is considering limiting the &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/covid-19-vaccine-label-change-alpha" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/covid-19-vaccine-label-change-alpha"&gt;COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt; to adults over the age of 65 and people who are at high risk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As long as the FDA approves the drug, clinicians can still prescribe it to people outside those limitations, said Daniel Kuritzkes, the chief of the division of Infectious Diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“If the vaccine is approved, any physician can prescribe it to a patient who they think might benefit from the vaccine,” Kuritzkes said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But the FDA is also weighing whether to &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/12/lifestyle/covid-young-children-pfizer/?utm_campaign=Globe_Facebook&amp;amp;s_campaign=bostonglobe%3Asocialflow%3Afacebook&amp;amp;p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;revoke&lt;/a&gt; authorization for Pfizer’s COVID vaccine for children under the age of 5. If the FDA does that, physicians would have “no discretion” to provide the vaccine for people who fall outside those restrictions, because authorizations are more restrictive than approvals, according to Kuritzkes. Pfizer is the only COVID vaccine available to that age group, so if authorization is revoked, kids younger than 5 will not have an officially approved option. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;On Tuesday, the &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/?srsltid=AfmBOooFUq8jhyxgjSSTTLwiOwyexEbizmubb-iVcIfOJxKprUEH38s2" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, diverging from the federal government, strongly recommended COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to 2 years. The group also advised that older children should have access to the vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Despite the uncertainty this fall, Dr. Sabrina Assoumou, an infectious disease specialist at Boston Medical Center, encouraged patients to stay up-to-date with their vaccinations. “Vaccines protect against severe disease, hospitalization, and death,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Another way to lower the risk of infection is to move gatherings outside, if the option is available, because ventilation can decrease the risk of transmission, she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;If you are at risk for severe disease and develop COVID, contact your health professional, she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“If you have symptoms, get tested — so we can break that chain of transmission,” Assoumou said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Assoumou encouraged patients to listen to local and state public health agencies, as well as professional medical societies, like the Infectious Diseases Society of America, of which she is a member.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The society is working with the &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt; to create guidance on COVID-19 immunization, and on Tuesday the group released &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/vaccine-integrity-project-presents-reassuring-data-vaccines-upcoming-respiratory-virus" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/vaccine-integrity-project-presents-reassuring-data-vaccines-upcoming-respiratory-virus"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; detailing key findings on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But ultimately, doctors like Assoumou are waiting to see what the federal government will do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“At this point, it’s most helpful to wait to see what happens, so that we can make recommendations  [to the] public,” Assoumou said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We all are committed to evidence-based recommendations,”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Robbie Goldstein, Massachusetts’ public health commissioner and a participant in the meetings, told the Globe Thursday. “It is not a question about, ‘Are we breaking from the federal government?’ It is, ‘How do we continue to do this thing that we’ve always done?’ which is to use science and evidence to drive our recommendations.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Goldstein emphasized the meetings were not specifically held to plot a separate path from federal authorities. The goal, he said, was to consider the future and structure of public health services. But the conversations were in part a response to the Trump administration’s public health policies, he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The states have not made any vaccination&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;policy changes based on the discussions so far, nor have they decided on a coordinated plan. But, the meeting itself marks a step toward independence from federal health agencies that a few years ago would have seemed unthinkable. Simply gathering each state’s public health leadership in one place is unusual. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Leaders of the public health departments of every New England state except New Hampshire, as well as New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, attended the meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday, Rhode Island’s Department of Health confirmed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In a statement, a spokesperson for the New Hampshire’s Department of Health and Human Resources said the state coordinates with national, regional, and local public health agencies in other ways. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The federal Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Massachusetts is a national leader in the growing effort to maintain public health standards during the Trump administration, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota vaccine expert working to compensate for Trump administration policies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“They’re doing things right now that no other state is doing,” Osterholm said. “Their leadership is important not just for the Northeast but for the whole country.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Goldstein &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/22/metro/trump-cuts-cdc-public-health-massachusetts/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/22/metro/trump-cuts-cdc-public-health-massachusetts/"&gt;has noted&lt;/a&gt; Massachusetts policymakers anticipated the possibility of a second Trump term and began preparing for federal funding cuts to public health programs well before the presidential election. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For decades, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been a reliable, nonpartisan coordinator of health information and guidance for the nation. States generally abide by the agency’s recommendations on who should receive which vaccinations. This year, though, delays in important vaccine recommendations and some decisions that seem guided more by ideology than science have rattled health and medical experts’ faith in the agency’s&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;ability under Kennedy to provide credible guidance. Kennedy ousted this summer a t&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/09/business/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-fires/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/09/business/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-fires/"&gt;rusted CDC advisory panel&lt;/a&gt; that helped shape the agency’s vaccine recommendations, replacing members with less experienced personnel, including some who openly share his skepticism toward vaccines. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“When we have such dramatic changes at the CDC,” Goldstein said, “it’s important for us to really double down on our commitment to science and evidence based recommendations.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;States could shape their vaccination recommendations with guidance from professional medical societies instead of the CDC, Goldstein has said. A coordinated message from Northeast states would help push insurers to cover recommended vaccines, he said, and lessen confusion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The other states participating in the Providence meetings were more circumspect about the event. A spokesperson from the Rhode Island health department said the meeting was simply an opportunity to discuss coordination and information sharing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Yet states are beginning to take steps toward more independence. While&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the Supreme Court ruled more than &lt;a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/197/11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/197/11/"&gt;a century ago&lt;/a&gt; that states can establish their own vaccination policies, many states have the CDC’s guidelines baked into law. That must change if states want to rely on recommendations from medical societies instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Governor Maura Healey introduced language in two supplemental budget bills this summer to give the state’s health commissioner more authority to set vaccine requirements &lt;a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/H4429" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/H4429"&gt;for schools&lt;/a&gt; and ensure a state fund can continue to cover the cost of &lt;a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/H4251.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/194/H4251.pdf"&gt;children’s vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And, Rhode Island this year &lt;a href="https://webserver.rilegislature.gov/BillText/BillText25/HouseText25/H5427A.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://webserver.rilegislature.gov/BillText/BillText25/HouseText25/H5427A.pdf"&gt;passed a law&lt;/a&gt; that grants pharmacists permission to administer COVID vaccines to children without federal approvals. Pennsylvania legislators expect to &lt;a href="https://www.pahouse.com/InTheNews/NewsRelease/?id=139220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.pahouse.com/InTheNews/NewsRelease/?id=139220"&gt;introduce a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would protect private insurance coverage for vaccines recommended by professional medical societies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;One of that bill’s sponsors, state Representative Arvind Venkat, a Pittsburgh Democrat, emphasized such legislation isn’t a vaccine mandate, but protects access to preventative measures grounded in science. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Nationally, the process of building a system for sharing scientific information about vaccinations independent from federal authorities is already underway. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As state public health leaders met in Providence Tuesday, the Vaccine Integrity Project, led by Osterholm, held a hour and a half virtual session to share information about the safety and efficacy of various flu, COVID, and RSV vaccines, mirroring the traditional function of the CDC advisory panel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Also on Tuesday, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued recommendations for COVID &lt;a href="https://watermark02.silverchair.com/peds_2025073924.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAzwwggM4BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggMpMIIDJQIBADCCAx4GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMrl99JII0UXg272B3AgEQgIIC771FZU5DiurEdzyFjjqZUyDLnDEq5i4a-8pMZGQCXtkZZZKAVL-OQSSlpu_AIov8PAvUD_vpNxgnu4p2IpNda-mOFvPH3DOmos8dul9xJsSAWNwjASSMqC9OsaOZjXhAAn3SS6uhjKSVLw5darXPe-tuJGI61pzTyxFskamtykOdnbmUlKuuCAL1X0HBx2U03ucTzP0-0LPFN2uy7KYOEMhFMh5Lv_XTOAVEpnv2X-d_mz3t8eDYxzIjLSJUsbpA8YDEV2BemsUogfW2Of2Qgt2ll2MjjLwVWR89ZyLSyrsuU9jMtFhKl7p3XLeUflI2Lze7AX7yLOhToHYYQBqbuB6L0G1llan9ttS1-SKTZ1oiH_TjFZdSWIJoJAJlyVXNgTeYHRnOaeCz__z1MuOwECsu1QM7IH5MhHwKUVWQHsXZekWSUPgfoYS-FIcauqbVrTxR4jMwQdUZ03-PXGzzQwWFZXgdeoA6Ajl_A5IkOCf-YOuBKo87tevIAfxKJkVl5BVojJJo-NO8fTaDjmBE5UY8oxfqJORIMFr7fW4K1H5qfDPRgKok4jG6getJ7N3LkZV6981973xiwYAy6s7RdhZcMQ9Nb1o873dK9oXTg1HvHmHet2D--DcPOhk94WaD2zyKlNOJeZ5f31aw00vZ5RLUyhHgcB_uj-4GTvhTVZTHw45OqWXxy4_UBPr49vB0xpLkW6AJgI1VvxjYFU2O62syGg0uOlRJO3JcSF-ZO_3VsyaL-pc8GMRhlN_pM3dtMpa5zTFDAbaPKoB7FuScR_dQbaPEtR3w48UlFYwHp6ccfp5cvRT8mjYh7LIHdHdaoDU1p6Gx9i_nJM2z0AdN_3haZaH9nAM2Jd3WU1JtzMQ5OplvimgptRHpGxiza-ubhxDpEkefhwQUKXdXGEFih9xDPbw-DiSWsADdq_alhyBNj8y33EGaXUCTyHDJvMdKFus3CP8qnxtyHzlZfB_YNurQ_jTtZmQVs1N9uqVpBYc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://watermark02.silverchair.com/peds_2025073924.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAzwwggM4BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggMpMIIDJQIBADCCAx4GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMrl99JII0UXg272B3AgEQgIIC771FZU5DiurEdzyFjjqZUyDLnDEq5i4a-8pMZGQCXtkZZZKAVL-OQSSlpu_AIov8PAvUD_vpNxgnu4p2IpNda-mOFvPH3DOmos8dul9xJsSAWNwjASSMqC9OsaOZjXhAAn3SS6uhjKSVLw5darXPe-tuJGI61pzTyxFskamtykOdnbmUlKuuCAL1X0HBx2U03ucTzP0-0LPFN2uy7KYOEMhFMh5Lv_XTOAVEpnv2X-d_mz3t8eDYxzIjLSJUsbpA8YDEV2BemsUogfW2Of2Qgt2ll2MjjLwVWR89ZyLSyrsuU9jMtFhKl7p3XLeUflI2Lze7AX7yLOhToHYYQBqbuB6L0G1llan9ttS1-SKTZ1oiH_TjFZdSWIJoJAJlyVXNgTeYHRnOaeCz__z1MuOwECsu1QM7IH5MhHwKUVWQHsXZekWSUPgfoYS-FIcauqbVrTxR4jMwQdUZ03-PXGzzQwWFZXgdeoA6Ajl_A5IkOCf-YOuBKo87tevIAfxKJkVl5BVojJJo-NO8fTaDjmBE5UY8oxfqJORIMFr7fW4K1H5qfDPRgKok4jG6getJ7N3LkZV6981973xiwYAy6s7RdhZcMQ9Nb1o873dK9oXTg1HvHmHet2D--DcPOhk94WaD2zyKlNOJeZ5f31aw00vZ5RLUyhHgcB_uj-4GTvhTVZTHw45OqWXxy4_UBPr49vB0xpLkW6AJgI1VvxjYFU2O62syGg0uOlRJO3JcSF-ZO_3VsyaL-pc8GMRhlN_pM3dtMpa5zTFDAbaPKoB7FuScR_dQbaPEtR3w48UlFYwHp6ccfp5cvRT8mjYh7LIHdHdaoDU1p6Gx9i_nJM2z0AdN_3haZaH9nAM2Jd3WU1JtzMQ5OplvimgptRHpGxiza-ubhxDpEkefhwQUKXdXGEFih9xDPbw-DiSWsADdq_alhyBNj8y33EGaXUCTyHDJvMdKFus3CP8qnxtyHzlZfB_YNurQ_jTtZmQVs1N9uqVpBYc"&gt;vaccination&lt;/a&gt; for children, including that all children ages 6 months to 23 months should be fully vaccinated, saying they were vulnerable to severe cases of COVID. The recommendation, which relied heavily on the information gathered by the Vaccine Integrity Project,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;contradicted &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/19/nation/defying-rfk-jr-pediatric-group-urges-covid-shots-young-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/19/nation/defying-rfk-jr-pediatric-group-urges-covid-shots-young-kids/"&gt;Kennedy’s recommendation&lt;/a&gt; that healthy children older than 6 months should not get the shot. It was the first time in 30 years the pediatrics organization meaningfully departed from federal guidance. Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1957914911415153107?s=46&amp;amp;t=9AHxthXdGRIl37bvHR6MCg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1957914911415153107?s=46&amp;amp;t=9AHxthXdGRIl37bvHR6MCg"&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; the organization of a “pay-to-play scheme,” saying it recommended the doses to benefit the pharmaceutical industry, and pointed to donations from some large pharma companies to a fund for children’s health the organization runs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This attack on the integrity of pediatricians is unfortunate, but it does not change the facts,” said Dr. Susan Kressly, the pediatrician academy’s president, in a statement. “Our immunization recommendations are rooted in decades of peer-reviewed science by the nation’s leading health experts.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There remain major obstacles to any effort to disentangle state vaccination policies from the federal government. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Osterholm’s Vaccine Integrity Project doesn’t have access to the unpublished studies, proprietary industry data, or ongoing trials without reported results the CDC can use to make vaccine recommendations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Private insurers rely on CDC recommendations to decide which vaccines they cover, though some have indicated they would be open to considering other scientific authorities. Pharmacists and clinicians, though, depend on federal programs to give them liability protection if patients have serious adverse reactions to vaccines. These protections only cover vaccines approved by the CDC, said Brigid Groves, vice president for professional affairs with the American Pharmacists Association, a trade organization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While the states that participated in this week’s assembly have no immediate plans to diverge from federal recommendations, a test may come soon. The CDC is overdue to issue COVID vaccine recommendations, and a meeting of the agency’s vaccine advisory committee is expected to happen in the coming weeks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“So much of this is unknown,” Goldstein said. “We haven’t seen how they’re going to structure their presentations and what they’re going to use to justify a decision.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Wells wanted to understand exactly how public health officials had contained measles outbreaks in the past, especially among communities similar to those of the Mennonite patients they were seeing initially in the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Immediately, she hit a snag: the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), normally a central resource for officials battling outbreaks like these, had been placed under a gag order by new Trump administration officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, Wells turned to the literature, reading everything she could find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She was familiar with the 2018-19 &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in New York City’s Orthodox Jewish communities, but it was an earlier episode that really caught her eye: a 2014 outbreak among Mennonites in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She sent an &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1602295" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about the Ohio outbreak to Zach Holbrooks, head of the public health department covering Gaines county, where the outbreak was centered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It seemed very similar to the culture of who we were working with in Gaines county,” Wells said. They spent the weekend “trying to figure out what we needed to do” before the cases were confirmed and announced to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-19m4xhf"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;I think there’s some stigma about getting vaccines&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Kathryn Wells, Lubbock's director of public health&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It took four months to quell the 2014 Ohio outbreak. The handful of cases pointing to a growing outbreak in Texas were unlikely to be resolved in a week or two, Wells said. “So we needed to make sure we were planning for the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They set up mass vaccination clinics, which were frequented more in Lubbock than in Gaines county. “I think there’s some stigma about getting vaccines,” Wells said – especially in highly visible places where news media tended to camp out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet vaccinations had worked well in Ohio to stop the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think they were able to do more going door to door and setting up smaller vaccination clinics and providing that education. We didn’t have the staffing available to us to do some of that,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is no cure for measles, but two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective at preventing the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In hesitant communities, though, it can be difficult to strike the right balance in talking about vaccines without alienating patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Yes, vaccines are the way to get us out of it, but when you’re working with a community that’s not hearing that, you need to find other messages” to help protect the community, Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Officials in Texas put out information – about isolation and quarantine to help slow down the spread, and about seeking care at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There were concerns about people just staying away from the hospital because of fear that they might do something wrong for their child,” Wells said. They worked to get the message to parents: “If your child is really struggling [with] breathing, don’t delay – bring them into a hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wells wishes they had also created free treatment centers to provide medical support for families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In hindsight, we probably could have taken some local doctors and nurse practitioners and set up some kind of clinic for people to come to if their child was really sick, where we could check their oxygen level, talk about what can we do to keep the child from getting dehydrated, and assess whether or not a child needed to go into the hospital,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-19m4xhf"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Unfortunately, what you have now is a very corrupt health and wellness influencer industry&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dr Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We probably should have offered that service to the community at a free clinic, so that they also had a place to ask questions and get answers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, patients saw private medical providers – at least one of whom, Dr Ben Edwards, gained notoriety for his anti-vaccine views and treatments without an evidence base for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Unfortunately, what you have now is a very corrupt health and wellness influencer industry that is pushing interventions like that as an alternative to vaccination, and that’s not how it works,” said Hotez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Responding to people’s questions about vaccines takes time and requires “real conversations” to understand and address their concerns, Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s a slow process. It’s going to take some of these one-on-one conversations – and then hopefully, if you change their mind, they’re going to be able to advocate to their friends and to the people they’re in contact with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the same time, Wells said, “we also need to make sure vaccines are easily available – not putting up barriers for people to get vaccinated when they want to”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the west Texas outbreak, Wells also suggested assembling teams of community health workers to educate their neighbors and encourage vaccination. But they didn’t have the money and time to do that, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Local health officials are well-suited to build relationships like these before crisis strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You need to have those relationships in place to work through whenever there’s a big pandemic or some kind of outbreak,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s a plan that helped with the Covid pandemic in Lubbock – identifying community leaders, including in churches, to create a “vaccine ambassador program” of lay people who helped others make vaccination appointments and arrange transportation, Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Officials could also gather information about vaccination rates at the local level to predict in which areas and communities outbreaks may take root, Hotez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The problem that we have is the CDC does not track any childhood immunization rates at the county level,” Hotez said. “They only do state and national immunization levels, which is not adequate, because of the way measles operates – it strikes clusters in counties with really low vaccination rates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To combat measles on the national level, the CDC could create a vaccination map of the country to understand where vulnerable pockets exist and begin health education campaigns tailored to those areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hotez co-authored a &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002578" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 creating a map like this based on information from state health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It was pretty shocking when we saw these big patches of the country where kids were not getting vaccinated, and it was missed by the CDC because they were only looking at statewide immunization rates,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Idaho, for example, is at high risk for a widespread measles epidemic, Hotez said. “The whole state of Idaho looks like the same vaccination rates as those pockets in west Texas. So the vulnerability remains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last Tuesday, Idaho &lt;a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/08/14/measles-reported-in-eastern-idaho-becoming-states-second-case-in-one-week/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; two measles cases in areas that hadn’t seen the disease in three decades.

Experts are only now starting to track these interactions systematically, and some even hope to harness these combinations to make drugs work better than they would on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Most drugs are unaffected by food," says Patrick Chan, professor of pharmacy practice and administration at Western University of Health Sciences in California. "In the certain cases where certain drugs are affected by food, those are the ones we need to watch out for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency require that drugs undergo food-effect testing, with trials involving people who &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/food-effect-bioavailability-and-fed-bioequivalence-studies" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;have either fasted or eaten a high-calorie, high-fat meal&lt;/a&gt; – two slices of toast with butter, two slices of fried bacon, two fried eggs, some hash-brown potatoes, and a large glass of whole milk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But it is almost impossible for them to test everything.

                &lt;p&gt;If Dr. Rudolph Tanzi has learned anything from his many years of research, it is that nothing helps the brain more than healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if you're taking supplements, nothing substitutes for lifestyle," Tanzi, the director of Genetics and Aging Research at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of child neurology at Harvard Medical School, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanzi, who is entering clinical trials for his own supplement brand &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://cognishield.com/pages/about-the-science" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;CogniSHIELD&lt;/a&gt;, said "SHIELD" is a reference to an acronym he came up with to encourage &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-neuroscientists-do-to-keep-brain-healthy-2023-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;good brain health&lt;/a&gt; and potentially reduce the risk of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facing-early-onset-alzheimers-how-family-copes-with-genetic-fate-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and other cognitive issues down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He shared why he recommends SHIELD to everyone and one daily supplement he takes to boost his &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-salad-greens-are-good-for-brain-health-aging-2024-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="0217ce4c-c7a6-491e-8c83-d549c98a572f" data-toc-id="0217ce4c-c7a6-491e-8c83-d549c98a572f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A mantra for great brain health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="0217ce4c-c7a6-491e-8c83-d549c98a572f"&gt;Tanzi broke down what SHIELD stands for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;leep for 7-8 hours a night to clear harmful protein buildup, such as amyloid plaques. "The faster you make amyloid, the sooner you get Alzheimer's," Tanzi said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;andle stress. "Chronic stress causes chronic inflammation," he said. &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/mental-health/benefits-of-meditation" rel=""&gt;Being more mindful&lt;/a&gt; can reduce the chances of cognitive decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;nteract with others.

"The more synapses you make in life, it's like money in the bank," Tanzi said. Keeping busy and having hobbies are also &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tips-for-living-to-100-from-centenarians-worlds-oldest-people-2024-6" rel=""&gt;linked to greater longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;iet, such as the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mediterranean-diet-best-healthy-eating-longevity-rankings-2025-1" rel=""&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;.

Her grandmother died of complications from RA, and in the last few months of her life, it was Smith who served as her caregiver, administering doses of &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.arthritis.org/drug-guide/medication-topics/understanding-methotrexate" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:methotrexate;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;methotrexate&lt;/a&gt; to treat her pain and inflammation. The drug, a form of chemotherapy also used to treat cancer, is so potent that Smith had to wear gloves to safely give it to her grandmother. So, when Smith’s doctor told her she too would probably have to take methotrexate long-term, her heart sank. “That was so scary for me,” she tells Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Smith’s RA and weight — 311 pounds — were “double negatives” against her health, her doctor said. She &lt;em&gt;had &lt;/em&gt;to lose the weight. And so Smith started following the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/health/wellness/nutrition/healthy-eating/article/mediterranean-diet-meager-budget-can-you-dupe-the-worlds-healthiest-meal-plans-100049940.html" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, losing 5 or 6 pounds in the process. But that wasn’t nearly enough to alleviate the excessive inflammation and pain in her joints during flare-ups, which could last as long as four months. Smith was in constant pain. Some days, she couldn’t go to work. Other times, she was physically incapable of playing with her 4-year-old daughter. “It was stress on top of stress, and those are some of the main triggers of a flare,” Smith says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;GLP-1 weight loss medications haven’t been approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis. But they’ve &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4823510/#:~:text=It%20was%20reported%20that%20GLP,on%20its%20anti%2Dinflammatory%20actions." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:demonstrated great power to reduce inflammation;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;demonstrated great power to reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. While Smith’s insurance wouldn’t cover the medication (deeming it for “cosmetic weight loss”), she got a prescription for &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/millions-of-people-are-taking-compounded-weight-loss-drugs-now-theyre-about-to-disappear-202621562.html" data-ylk="slk:compounded semaglutide;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;compounded semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; from a local provider and, later, compounded tirzepatide from an online provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Seven months later, Smith, 30, hasn’t had a single arthritis flare-up. “I’ve been able to come off my rheumatoid arthritis medicines — and these are medications that people &lt;em&gt;never &lt;/em&gt;come off of,” she says. It’s the biggest way that Smith’s life has changed since starting a GLP-1, but far from the only shift. For this installment of the Yahoo series &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/tagged/on-my-weigh/" data-ylk="slk:On My Weigh;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On My Weigh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Smith explains in her own words how the medication has helped her teach her daughter healthy eating habits and given her the clarity she needed to leave the teaching job that had burned her out. “Since being on a GLP-1, I put myself and my mental and physical health first,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassandra Smith has lost nearly 70 pounds since starting tirzepatide.

She was missing out, and I just wanted to change that and be able to play with her. And I wanted to get off of methotrexate, the potent medication I was taking for my rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress report: &lt;/strong&gt;I feel amazing. My inflammation levels are down, I’m happier and I haven’t had a single arthritis flare-up since I’ve been on tirzepatide. I’m full of energy, I’m back to loving going out and dressing up — I just see myself. I’ve lost 69 pounds in seven months, and the other day I was able to put a towel all the way around me to cover up. I don’t think I’d been able to do that since high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food noise volume: &lt;/strong&gt;Before starting tirzepatide, my food noise was an 8 out of 10. Until recently, I was a full-time schoolteacher, plus I’m a full-time mom and girlfriend to a full-time musician. Staying busy kept my food noise at bay. But when I did want to eat, I wanted to eat the wrong way. Now that I’m on a GLP-1, I can’t say my food noise is completely gone. But it’s at about a 3, and when I do have cravings, it’s for taco salad, or soup or broccoli. It’s very weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="day-in-the-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day in the life &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="rise-and-shine"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rise and shine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Prior to my GLP-1 journey, I woke up in pain every morning. I had to wait about 15 minutes before I could physically get up and move out of bed. I was so angry at my body. I felt like I was too young to be waking up in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I just jump up. I wake up at 5:15 a.m., go to the bathroom and jump on the scale. Then I tell my social media followers, “Good morning, this is going to be a good day.” I get my daughter up at about 6:30 a.m. I’m happy, and I go into her room refreshed because I’ve gotten a good night’s rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="first-bites"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First bites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I used to have a bacon, egg and cheese croissant, hash browns and a large iced coffee from Burger King or McDonald’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I might get similar things when I eat breakfast out, but I no longer get full combo meals. I don’t drink coffee or sodas. I just have hydration packets in my water that I bring from home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At home, I make eggs with some kind of meat or protein. Sometimes I’ll still have a croissant, but I purchase them from Sam’s Club now. They have fewer calories and 16 grams of protein. Even though I’m not always cooking, what I’m eating is better-quality food. And I make sure I’m always getting protein with breakfast. I’m setting myself up for success with that first bite, rather than eating those potatoes and iced coffee that are going to have me crashing by 12 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="get-ready-with-me"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get ready with me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before, everything I wore was very dark. We all know that black covers up everything. I would just throw on some sweatpants or joggers and just go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I actually care what I look like. I wake up earlier, because I want to have time to choose colors that I feel good and comfortable in. I like to wear a lot of different patterns. Prior to my major weight gain, I used to be a girl who loved heels. I’m slowly getting back into heels and jewelry, because I feel beautiful again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="make-a-move"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a move&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For about four years, before I started my GLP-1 journey, I had a gym membership that I never used. Now I know that gym life just isn’t for me. I’ll go every now and again, but it’s not a long-term solution because it’s not something that I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But now I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; in a season where I want to do things that I enjoy &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;that are good for me. Since starting my GLP-1, I’ve canceled my gym membership. Instead, I’ve been trying to incorporate things that I can maintain into my day-to-day routine — things like taking daily walks with my daughter and going to the park and playing with her. I have weights, a squat machine, a sit-up machine and a foldable elliptical all at home. When I feel like it, I go downstairs and work out. But I don’t want to put myself back in a position where I’m doing things just because people say I should. I want to be the captain of my own boat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="dose-time"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dose time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I’m actually on a &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peptide-stacking-latest-viral-wellness-162349352.html" data-ylk="slk:whole peptide stack;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;whole peptide stack&lt;/a&gt;, which is a set of several injections my doctor prescribed to help optimize my health. So, every Monday, I take my tirzepatide, Lipo-C [an amino acid and vitamin injection that is &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/buying-using-medicine-safely/using-fat-dissolving-injections-are-not-fda-approved-can-be-harmful" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:not approved by the Food and Drug Administration;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;not approved by the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; but has &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3486781/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:shown some promise for weight loss in research;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;shown some promise for weight loss in research&lt;/a&gt;] and anti-aging &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/healthy-aging/longevity/articles/nad-does-help-longevity-164617662.html" data-ylk="slk:NAD+;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;NAD+&lt;/a&gt; injections. Wednesday, I take the NAD+, Friday, I take NAD+ and Lipo-C. I feel like I have a really good stack, and it is prescribed by a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; doctor. I think it helps me to feel like the best version of myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I consider Sunday nights my cheat night. I’ll eat something more fatty than usual, like a taco salad (but I’ll actually eat the shell), or I’ll have Olive Garden cheese ravioli with marinara sauce. I try to give my body something to eat the night before I take my medications. My cravings are stronger right before my shot days. But I’ve been able to train myself to be disciplined while having grace for myself and understand that it’s OK to eat things that you enjoy. Plus, now I crave things that I love &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;that are healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith is more active — and wearing bright colors — since starting a GLP-1. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Getty, courtesy of Cassandra Smith)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="lets-do-lunch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s do lunch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My pre-GLP-1 lunch was a burger, some fried chicken nuggets, hot wings — anything fried, that was quick to grab-and-go or pick up from the drive-through. Cooking was just never my concern back then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now I actually take the time to cook instead, because I’ve realized that if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. A typical lunch these days is whatever I didn’t eat the night before for dinner. We all know that those of us on GLP-1s don’t eat as much and we always have leftovers. So, I’ve learned to love them. I never used to eat them, because I was going to fast food restaurants a lot — and who wants to eat McDonald’s the next day? Every now and then I’ll splurge and get some sushi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="happy-hour"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy hour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before starting tirzepatide, I didn’t really feel like I had free time. I spent a lot of it sleeping. I felt mentally drained from dealing with kids all day (much as I love them) and crashing from what I ate. I would get home and just sleep. I called it hibernation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, I feel like I have more time — and did even before I quit my job. I enjoy going to Ulta and looking at new skin care, or going window-shopping at TJ Maxx. I know I’m still transitioning sizes, so I restrain myself from buying too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Any time spent with my child is quality time for me. But now it’s actually quality time for &lt;em&gt;her.&lt;/em&gt; She doesn’t have to just sit in bed and watch TV because that’s all I physically can do. We’re going to the park, we go on nature walks, we go to my parents’ house in the middle of the week because I have the energy to drive there, instead of being too drained because I ate potatoes in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The quantity of time with her hasn’t changed, but the quality of it has changed drastically. It’s more intentional, and she gains more out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="dinner-bell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dinner bell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I never had enough time in the day to really focus on what to eat before my GLP-1 journey. It was just, &lt;em&gt;Throw it in the microwave, throw it in the oven. &lt;/em&gt;When I went out for dinner,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I used to love to get steak. But when I found out that I had rheumatoid arthritis, steak would cause me to flare. So I stopped eating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, my go-to protein is salmon, with a veggie, and they’re both cooked in my house. As soon as I began taking tirzepatide, I started to make sure protein was in every single thing I was eating. That first month or so, I tracked everything. But I learned how much protein and how many calories were in the things I was eating — as people on GLP-1s, we eat the same things over and over — and it just became second nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My doctor taught me to stay on the outside aisles of the store when I go to the grocery store. As long as you stay on those walls, you’re eating fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, fresh meats and fresh eggs. If you’re buying food from the center of the store, the more sodium and calories you’re getting in those processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Having a 4-year-old daughter, it’s so exciting for me to be able to raise her in a way that I wish I had been raised. Cooking is a whole activity for us, and for her, cooking healthy food will be normal. I get to create that generational knowledge with my daughter and save her from having to be on a GLP-1 later, because she has had the opportunity to learn to eat the right things from the beginning. She asks if we’re having salmon and broccoli for dinner. Today, my sister picked my daughter and my nephew up and they went to McDonald’s. My daughter didn’t want anything. She understands, at 4 years old, that we don’t eat that. My mom makes treats for major events, and sometimes she’ll eat some of the extras. My daughter will be like, “Grandma, you shouldn’t eat that!” My mom says, “Get this little girl, she’s doing too much!” But I love it. I know that, even when I’m not present, the things I taught her still matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="lets-get-the-bill"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s get the bill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before I started taking tirzepatide, I was spending a lot of money eating out every day with my daughter. At Chick-fil-A, we were spending $25 on one meal. It added up to about $800 a month. And on top of that was the junk I was buying at the grocery store to stock up the house. It probably totaled about $1,200 a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Luckily, Shed, my provider, has really good prices for GLP-1s. I spend about $300 a month on my medications. Ultimately, I’m saving money. My budget is better, and I’m able to invest more and help the people around me more because I’m not going out every day spending money on food. The bill is amazing. I love the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 09:00:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-AFBVV95cUxPR1Q1NzhBUHp6TGJ0akl6X0N6QlZPS0J0eXE2Nmh6UFIyaFZlb0tIeFFKNXdqakdEQm8zQWRSUlF5eE5nQm1abGxSMmRackFsWnAxVG45ZktnS01VMHloRGhXcEdZWFc3MmZCY01fTm5WTUV6akxOdTd5RWI1UDgyWGQzOWFEalQ0NkpFRE5pd1hRNUJnc3lQQWwwZzlfZ3VadDNScGV3Mm1peVdoM1dmWVdLeFYyUHRxYUJJcWRXMGF4VGl5V2VmMTB3V0V3VmRvNWwwdjR6S0lmelc5VlVHY3BVUy1nWkRkLWxDZmxqV0N3NFI4SzVTbg</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎疫苗接种的秋季药房之旅可能布满障碍- Politico</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPTVBxSUdxc3lBdlpsVi00RklDbFdOdGVzSkhUT3B1TnByZE9oaFAwckRtSUZ4Q2NZV0lqT1lqbXJCMjJ2bXFhWG9zdzh0UWZfQ2twb0Q1OXRMSEVwZ2dfYVd3TTNKcWRGVEVhd1d0dDBOY1ZmTEJUYUVsLU5CTlNKQUMydWltSDh6TFh2SDJ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Politico</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxPTVBxSUdxc3lBdlpsVi00RklDbFdOdGVzSkhUT3B1TnByZE9oaFAwckRtSUZ4Q2NZV0lqT1lqbXJCMjJ2bXFhWG9zdzh0UWZfQ2twb0Q1OXRMSEVwZ2dfYVd3TTNKcWRGVEVhd1d0dDBOY1ZmTEJUYUVsLU5CTlNKQUMydWltSDh6TFh2SDJ3</guid></item><item><title>可以在其轨道上阻止癌症的新疫苗和治疗方法- The i Paper</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQWTRuUFl5ZV9YRVZSckF6VXpQNmMxWVNjYm1QWk54SUd3NTVLZVhvTHNWN1kwemJJS3BheThLN19ReWszdVNpU21tM0JkS0NnQ180a29Pa3J6MERVcUVWN3dFYjJzc2M2bFJnTXhHajF0a0RjYmkzM3d1S2ZsQlA3WGlSS19tQjZQQnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="inews__post-excerpt"&gt;
					The next advances in defeating cancer may come from a surprising place - our own natural defence mechanisms					                &lt;/p&gt;
				        &lt;div class="inews__post-content entry-content article-content"&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="post_in-line_link" href="https://inews.co.uk/topic/cancer?ico=in-line_link"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most feared of all medical conditions, is often seen as an unstoppable force. But in fact, the opposite is true. It is common for our bodies to successfully eradicate early cancers without us even noticing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By middle age, most of us probably have several microscopic tumours dotted around the body that are in the process of being destroyed by the immune system. It is only when cancers start beating our immune defences that they grow to a noticeable size and cause symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a tumour has reached this stage, while the &lt;a class="post_in-line_link" href="https://inews.co.uk/news/health/the-truth-about-boosting-your-immune-system-fighting-viruses-819001?ico=in-line_link"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; battle continues, the cancer is much more likely to win. Yet many scientists believe the fact that the immune system can defeat at least some early cancers suggests it could hold the secret to developing better treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="inews__shorts"&gt;&lt;span class="inews__post__label inews__post__label-new-feature"&gt;New Feature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="inews__shorts__title"&gt;In Short&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="inews__shorts__strap"&gt;Quick Stories. Same trusted journalism.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last decade or so, they have been developing a range of different measures aimed at harnessing the immune system’s cancer-killing powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They include genetically modified immune cells that are precision-engineered to wipe out tumours, as well as vaccines that could mean dangerous cells are killed even before they are classed as cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our immune systems are already doing this. We’re just giving them a bump to do it better,” said Professor Sarah Blagden, an oncologist&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;at the University of Oxford, who is involved in this research. “This is a totally different way of thinking about cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Better survival rates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of medical history, cancer therapies ignored our immune systems, using more the direct approaches of surgery to cut out the tumour, then &lt;a class="post_in-line_link" href="https://inews.co.uk/topic/chemotherapy?srsltid=AfmBOooOWxUAywNG7aqQQx8kjqrFt7Bzuo4_3IwUMYYdZYzMMyEICVvd&amp;amp;ico=in-line_link"&gt;chemotherapy &lt;/a&gt;and radiotherapy to poison any remaining cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progressive improvements to these approaches have led to better survival rates, with about half of people now surviving for at least a decade after a cancer diagnosis (see graphic), a length of time that is usually seen as signifying a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We became aware of the immune system’s potential after noticing that immune cells are present inside and next to tumours, often actively fighting the tumour cells, even when someone is dying from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathologists have also long noted that post-mortems of people who had died from other causes sometimes reveal small tumours that had not been noticed during life, suggesting the immune system was successfully keeping them at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the more detailed an examination of a certain organ takes place, the more likely it is to turn up either microscopic tumours or clumps of cells that look suspiciously pre-cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have found that for instance, &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-017-3808-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;two in 10 women&lt;/a&gt; had an unnoticed breast cancer or pre-cancer at the time of death, while an estimated six in 10 men who were 80 or older had &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.29538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;unnoticed prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is impossible to know the total number of pre-cancers we may have, “it is likely that someone in their fifties has multiple pre-cancers in their bodies that are [being] held in check”, said Professor Blagden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune system’s role is usually seen as wiping out invading pathogens like bacteria and viruses, but several types of immune cells – including ones called T-cells – can recognise and destroy cancer cells, due to their mutations that let them multiply faster than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as cancers grow they also acquire mutations that let them evade the normal immune defences in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one recently arrived group of cancer drugs, called &lt;a class="post_in-line_link" href="https://inews.co.uk/news/science/immune-system-trained-drug-resistant-cancers-study-559868?ico=in-line_link"&gt;checkpoint inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;, work by blocking proteins that act as a brake on the immune system, although these medicines do not work for everyone.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Genetically engineered immune attack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other ways of harnessing the immune system may be more effective. One approach has given promising results for when cancer arises in cells that belong to a different branch of the immune system: B-cells, the cells that make antibodies to fight off pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, a high-tech treatment for leukaemia involves doctors taking a blood sample from the patient, extracting their cancer-killing T-cells, and adding a gene that means they seek out and destroy B-cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some patients, these altered cells, now called CAR-T cells, survive and multiply, and have been detected in the blood – still killing off the cancerous B-cells – for more than 10 years after they were injected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was a really big breakthrough,” said Dr Dani Edmunds, research information manager at Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has proven tougher to make CAR-T cells that work against solid cancers, like a breast or colon tumour, as opposed to the blood cancer leukaemia, perhaps because it is harder for them to get inside the tumour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this summer, a CAR-T cell therapy against cancers of the stomach was found to help people live somewhat longer – from 5.5 months to 8 months – in a &lt;a href="https://news.cancerresearchuk.org/2025/05/31/asco-2025-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;small randomised trial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the benefit was modest, this is the first such success for CAR-T cells in solid tumours and so could be “an important step forward”, said Dr Catherine Elliott, CRUK’s director of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Vaccines as treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune system intervention we are most familiar with is vaccination – when we are injected with, for instance, a weakened virus, which teaches our body to fight it off when we meet the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has inspired some scientists to try to use a similar approach to help rev up the immune response against cancer. This is called a “therapeutic vaccine” to distinguish it from the way that vaccines are usually used as prevention against illnesses, not therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several therapeutic cancer vaccines are in trials, including ones for cancers of the bowel, skin and head and neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, NHS England signalled that it sees cancer vaccines as so promising they should be a top research priority, by setting up a system to help patients get into a vaccine trial if there is one for their type of tumour, called the &lt;a class="post_in-line_link" href="https://inews.co.uk/news/15-nhs-hospitals-game-changing-cancer-vaccines-rolled-out-first-3850205?ico=in-line_link"&gt;Cancer Vaccine Launch Pad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immense research effort that went into making&lt;a class="post_in-line_link" href="https://inews.co.uk/topic/covid-19-vaccines?srsltid=AfmBOopvAV2u0JgXkYz3sQSYMuIzU_PMjVJXdhjhKZmpSJ3TtpKmcPA2&amp;amp;ico=in-line_link"&gt; Covid vaccines&lt;/a&gt; has helped here, with some of the cancer vaccines being based on similar technologies, including ones based on mRNA made by BioNTech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Vaccines to stop cancer from starting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as therapeutic cancer vaccines, scientists such as Professor Blagden are trying to develop vaccines for cancer in the traditional sense, in that they would prevent a cancer from starting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This aims to eliminate the cells when they have some pre-cancerous mutations but have not become a full-blown cancer. This stage may last for decades before the cells eventually accumulate enough mutations to overcome the immune attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pre-cancerous mutations make the cells look slightly different to the immune system and this could be enhanced if the immune system is given a nudge by the right vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccines alert the immune system to recognise&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;several different mutations, to give the best chance of catching all pre-cancerous cells. They are being developed against cancers of the lung, breast, bowel and endometrium, the lining of the womb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, just a few such vaccines may be able to protect against a much bigger number of different tumours because the same pre-cancerous mutations are involved in most of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I want to do eventually is merge all of these vaccines into one vaccine that we give the population to protect them from cancer, perhaps in their thirties or forties,” said Professor Blagden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it could not defeat every single type of cancer, it could perhaps prevent most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Vaccine against all cancers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea of an “All Vax”, as  Professor Blagden is tentatively calling it, may sound overly ambitious, but the Oxford team already has £70m of investment from two major pharmaceutical companies (which she cannot yet reveal) in their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inews__shortcode-relatedarticleinline inews__post inews__post-teaser" id="color-context-related-article-3818911" data-post-id="3818911"&gt;&lt;div class="inews__shortcode-relatedarticleinline__content"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Read Next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a class="inews__post-teaser__media" href="https://inews.co.uk/news/health/cancer-appointments-risk-delay-doctors-strike-3818911" title="Cancer appointments at risk of delay due to doctors strike"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SEI_257020471.jpg?crop=213px%2C143px%2C781px%2C441px&amp;amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Cancer appointments at risk of delay due to doctors strike"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And whether or not the All Vax comes to fruition, the increasing focus on pre-cancers and the immune system may yield other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a test for pre-cancers that detects the immune response to them in the blood is being developed in the hope it will work for multiple kinds of tumours. This could allow earlier treatment with better chance of a cure, said researcher Dr Victoria Goss at the University of Southampton.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Swedish firm called Elypta is working on a &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2115328119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;urine test for multiple tumours&lt;/a&gt;, which gives a positive result up to five years before people get a cancer diagnosis. This may work partly by detecting the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Professor Blagden, the only strange thing is that we have previously overlooked this area’s potential. “It’s quite shocking that this kind of prequel to cancer exists and has so far been largely ignored by medicine,” she said. “If effective, we could make cancer a disease of the past and not of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;

In their version of seek, viewers would find these two canines guiding their mom by taking her to their treat counter in the most hilarious way. The pet parent recorded her Golden Retrievers pointing towards the direction of their comfort food in a video, which has quickly gained more than 30K likes so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever points to mom to follow directions towards the treat in video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Golden Retrievers know the art of getting things they want, and many pet parents will agree with this. Even in this video, Blue and Bella ended up taking their mom towards their treat counter in the most unexpected way — by pointing towards it. And let us tell you, unlike other dogs, these pooches did not bark, make a fuss, or grumble for their human companions to decode what they wanted. Instead, they pointed towards their mom to simply follow their directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The dog mom made sure to capture her Golden Retrievers’ action of giving her the direction in a video, proving her fur baby acted as a half-human by pinpointing the treats they love. Uploaded on @bellaandblueberry, the owner also showed the curiosity with which Blue and Bella guided her to the kitchen as if saying, “Mom, come on, do I need to spell it out for you?…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It seems this adorable video even got the internet talking.

Over several days, the fires reduced much of the town of Lāhainā to ashes, displacing thousands and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/death-toll-of-maui-wildfires-rises-to-106-people-1850742926"&gt;killing more than 100 people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New research published Thursday, August 22, in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2025.1611198/full"&gt;Frontiers in Climate&lt;/a&gt; suggests this disaster also caused a population-wide increase in mortality beyond what the official death count captured. By calculating the all-cause excess fatality rate—how many more deaths took place over a given period than expected—scientists found a 67% increase in the local mortality rate for August 2023. During the deadliest week of the blaze, the local death rate was 367% higher than expected. These findings underscore a need for improved disaster preparedness that incorporates Native Hawaiian ecological knowledge, the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What excess death rate reveals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking at the excess death rate offered a fuller picture of the fire’s impact, co-first author Michelle Nakatsuka, a medical student and researcher at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, told Gizmodo in an email. “The official numbers mostly count direct causes, like burns or smoke inhalation, but excess deaths capture [the] true toll better by telling us how many more people died than would have otherwise been expected in the month of the Lāhainā fires,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Disasters like wildfires often cause deaths in indirect ways that affect communities over time. When clinics shut down and roads are blocked off, people can’t refill their prescriptions or get dialysis treatments, Nakatsuka explained. Stress and displacement can worsen chronic conditions, and power or communication failures can delay emergency responses. “These impacts are amplified in under-resourced settings and [are] disproportionately suffered by vulnerable groups, like the elderly or people of color,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The tragic toll of the Maui fires&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even with this knowledge, Nakatsuka and her colleagues were surprised by the increase in excess mortality during the month of August 2023. Their analysis included all causes of death except covid-19. “While we anticipated an increase in excess deaths, seeing more than 80 additional deaths in the month of the Lāhainā fires was striking,” Nakatsuka said. “It was also surprising to see that the proportion of those deaths occurring outside of medical settings was larger than expected,” she added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Indeed, the number of deaths that didn’t take place in a medical context—such as the emergency room—rose from 68% in previous months to 80% in August 2023. These people died in homes or public locations, suggesting that many were unable to reach medical care because of the fires.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A path to resilience&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While all-cause excess mortality is useful for correlating increased fatalities with natural disasters, it offers little insight into the details of these deaths, Nakatsuka clarified. “The main limitation here is that we can’t say exactly which deaths were caused by the fires or look into Lāhainā-specific excess mortality; we can only measure the overall increase in deaths,” she said, adding that future research should analyze death records alongside medical and toxicology reports to identify causes of death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, these findings reveal a need to improve Maui’s disaster preparedness and invest in wildfire mitigation strategies rooted in Indigenous knowledge, Nakatsuka said. “Native Hawaiian practices center around caring for the land (mālama ʻāina) in ways that naturally reduce fire risk, like restoring native plants, maintaining diverse ecosystems, and managing water resources,” she said. “Bringing Indigenous knowledge together with modern climate prediction tools will minimize risk of future climate crises and center the community’s voice at the heart of disaster prevention and recovery efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;

Both needed urgent procedures to clear their uteruses. Neither received them. Both died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;At the outset of Texas’ abortion ban, medical experts worried women like Porsha and Brenda would die from delays in care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;It may never be known exactly how many Texas women have died as a result of the state’s abortion restrictions. It’s not always possible to determine to what degree the bans, and the fear around them, influenced a patient’s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;And the state &lt;a class="underline text-primary" href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2024/12/06/deaths-will-be-in-vain-texas-body-to-skip-2-years-of-maternal-death-data-amid-pushback/" target="_blank"&gt;is not trying to find out&lt;/a&gt;. The Texas Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Review Committee, the body responsible for investigating maternal deaths, has announced it is not investigating cases from 2022 and 2023, including the immediate aftermath of the state’s almost-total abortion ban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;To help fill that gap, &lt;i&gt;The Dallas Morning News&lt;/i&gt; gathered hundreds of pages of autopsies and death records of maternal deaths that have occurred since Texas restricted abortion in late 2021. &lt;i&gt;The News&lt;/i&gt; then asked obstetricians, including those specialized in abortion procedures, to review cases where abortion care might have been lifesaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;In the cases of Brenda and Porsha, those experts agreed. They both died after hospitals chose not to provide abortion procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="flex flex-col items-center py-8"&gt;&lt;img src="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2025/texas-abortion-ban-pregnancy-health-care-jeopardized/assets/images/icon_uterus.59c26f03.png" alt="Descriptive alt text" class="py-6"&gt;&lt;p class="text-xl font-bold"&gt;Treated too late&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto max-w-2xl py-4 text-center md:py-4 px-0 md:text-left font-light text-sm font-sans"&gt;&lt;img srcset="../assets/images/maternal-deaths-socks-600.6c9d3e55.jpg 600w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-socks-1200.7789ee0f.jpg 1200w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-socks-1800.46d47a0f.jpg 1800w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-socks-2400.c25f878c.jpg 2400w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-socks-3000.6efb1007.jpg 3000w" sizes="100vw" src="../assets/images/maternal-deaths-socks-600.6c9d3e55.jpg" alt="Maria Ramirez Norales holds up small knitted gloves, originally intended for her grandson, at her home in Del Valle, Texas.

Her daughter, Brenda Yolani Arzu Ramirez, died in November 2021 when her baby died inside of her and she developed an infection 22 weeks into her pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pt-4 px-0 font-sans font-light text-xs uppercase"&gt;Visual by Azul Sordo | Staff Photographer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;When Brenda Yolani Arzu Ramirez arrived at the hospital in Georgetown — five months pregnant — she already showed clear warning signs of sepsis, caused by a life-threatening infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;The OB-GYN who assessed her suspected she needed urgent care, beyond what she could provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;This would be Brenda’s third child; the 33-year-old already had two little boys at home. In her previous pregnancies, she had faced complications — preeclampsia, which can cause dangerously high blood pressure in pregnancy and after birth. Both times, she was far enough along that her babies could be successfully delivered by cesarean section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;This time was different. Brenda was only 22 ½ weeks into her pregnancy. She was feverish, vomiting and short of breath. Her head ached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;So she left the ranch where she was living with her boyfriend and his family, catching a ride to St. David’s Georgetown Hospital, about 30 miles north of downtown Austin. It was the first time, hospital records indicate, that she received medical care for this pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;In the emergency room, medical staff recorded Brenda’s temperature as 103 degrees, and lab tests showed a low white blood cell count, according to hospital records. When they searched for a fetal heartbeat on an ultrasound, they couldn’t find one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;It was November 2021, and less than three months had passed since state lawmakers enacted the Texas Heartbeat Act, which made physicians targets for civil litigation if they provided abortions. Across the state, previable rupture of membranes — when a woman’s water breaks before a fetus can survive on its own — was one of the pregnancy complications doctors told &lt;i&gt;The News&lt;/i&gt; had created the most consternation for hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Based on the severity of Brenda’s condition, the hospital’s OB-GYN thought Brenda may need a dilation and evacuation, or D&amp;amp;E — a type of procedure commonly used for second-trimester stillbirths and pregnancy terminations — to clear her uterus. She put in an order for Brenda to be transferred to St. David’s North Austin Medical Center, another institution in the hospital system that had greater surgical and intensive care resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;The OB-GYN’s practice group declined to comment, citing medical privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Brenda was admitted a little before 6:30 p.m., with IV antibiotics in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Brenda did not receive the immediate procedure the Georgetown doctor had expected. Instead, doctors provided her with a high dose of pitocin to expedite delivery, hospital records show. She delivered her baby vaginally a couple hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;During that time, she became critically ill. The death of her baby had caused a bacterial infection, then septic shock, resulting in inflammation throughout her body. She was visibly confused, her blood pressure had dropped and she was not responding to intravenous fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;By Brenda’s fourth day in the hospital, she was in multiple organ failure. Her platelet count had plummeted. Her liver and kidneys were damaged and failing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Her prognosis was grave, one specialist wrote in an assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="pt-6 text-center md:py-10 md:text-left"&gt;&lt;img srcset="../assets/images/maternal-deaths-bear-600.c2918cb2.jpg 600w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-bear-1200.f07ed420.jpg 1200w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-bear-1800.edf21c6c.jpg 1800w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-bear-2400.6da4c5bc.jpg 2400w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-bear-3000.ff164a51.jpg 3000w" sizes="100vw" src="../assets/images/maternal-deaths-bear-600.c2918cb2.jpg" alt="Maria holds a stuffed bear from her daughter, Brenda.

Now, she was facing the prospect of losing another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;As Maria continued to visit Brenda in the hospital, she watched her daughter’s left fingers, then the entire hand, turn black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;The eldest of four siblings, Brenda had strong maternal instincts, Maria said. She used to tell one of her sisters that she didn’t want to stop having babies until she had a girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;At one point during her almost two-week hospital stay, Brenda seemed to improve, despite the onset of organ failure. She was awake and eating, no longer on breathing support. She was well enough to talk with her sons over a video call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;“It’s like she woke up to say goodbye to her babies,” Maria said in Spanish. “She was laughing. She told them she loved them so much and would be back soon to play with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Days later, Maria’s son got a call from the hospital. Brenda was having a medical crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;By the time he got to the hospital less than an hour later, Brenda was dead. She had suffered a seizure before her heart stopped, death records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Medical experts who reviewed Brenda’s death and hospital records at &lt;i&gt;The News&lt;/i&gt;’ request said her transfer from Georgetown was appropriate, as she clearly needed a higher level of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;But the transfer, coupled with a vaginal delivery, represented a crucial delay in Brenda’s care, said Dr. Deborah Bartz, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a reproductive medicine specialist in Boston. Surgical evacuation of the uterus, especially when the cervix is already dilated, as Brenda’s was, will almost always be faster than waiting for a vaginal delivery, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;At Brenda’s advanced stage of pregnancy, she needed a D&amp;amp;E, Bartz said, a procedure that not all OB-GYNs are trained to perform. It involves multiple surgical techniques and tools to remove all the placental and fetal tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto max-w-2xl py-4 text-center md:py-4 px-0 md:text-left font-light text-sm font-sans"&gt;&lt;img srcset="../assets/images/maternal-deaths-dr-bartz-600.8aa62967.jpg 600w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-dr-bartz-1200.b18fb8a1.jpg 1200w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-dr-bartz-1800.6e1296de.jpg 1800w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-dr-bartz-2400.b3ce1d2d.jpg 2400w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-dr-bartz-3000.943ba2f9.jpg 3000w" sizes="100vw" src="../assets/images/maternal-deaths-dr-bartz-600.8aa62967.jpg" alt="Dr. Deborah Bartz, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology at Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, is a national expert in high-risk pregnancies and reproductive health care.

Those hours allowed dangerous bacteria to continue spreading throughout Brenda’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Dr. Nancy Binford, a longtime OB-GYN practicing in Austin, said previable rupture of membranes can be tricky to manage. It’s never clear how much time doctors have before risking the onset of an infection. Some women can have their water break and be fine for a week. Others can deteriorate rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Once sepsis is identified, time is crucial. Every 15 minutes count, Binford said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;In a statement, St. David’s HealthCare, which owns both of the hospitals where Brenda was treated, said it could not comment on the specifics of Brenda’s care due to patient privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;As a Level IV Maternal Facility, St. David’s North Austin Medical Center has the capability to provide comprehensive care for pregnant and postpartum patients, the statement said, including D&amp;amp;E procedures and induction of labor. Management of an intrauterine fetal demise like Brenda’s involves assessment of numerous factors, the statement continued, including patient medical history, gestational age, risk and relevant laws and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;“Similar to any highly specialized medical field, access to D&amp;amp;E and/or induction may be limited in many settings, especially at later gestational ages, adding further complexity to the decision process,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;More than three years have passed since Brenda’s death. Her sons now live with their grandmother, Maria, in Del Valle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;The boys were so young when Brenda died that they refer to Maria as mom. When they see pictures of Brenda, they think they are of Maria from when she was younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;“I try to keep as many photos and videos of her as I can,” Maria said, “so when her kids are older, I can try to explain why their mom is gone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="flex flex-col items-center py-8"&gt;&lt;img src="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2025/texas-abortion-ban-pregnancy-health-care-jeopardized/assets/images/icon_uterus.59c26f03.png" alt="Descriptive alt text" class="py-6"&gt;&lt;p class="text-xl font-bold"&gt;A deadly delay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto max-w-2xl space-y-6"&gt;&lt;div class="md:p-8 md:px-0"&gt;&lt;p class="pb-4 font-sans text-sm font-medium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="bf787fb1-13a8-4752-b1c3-48e1190221bc" data-exs-config='{"videos":{"sources":[{"title":"‘I was screaming for help’: Texas abortion laws leave the Ngumezi family shattered","id":"0f2bcdae-c472-4f70-8e26-76adfb14e32e","source":"https://large-cdn.ex.co/transformations-account/production/f0da7067-dc1e-4ad2-a73d-a20807c95ec1/0f2bcdae-c472-4f70-8e26-76adfb14e32e/720p.mp4","fallbackSource":"https://large-cdn.ex.co/transformations-account/production/f0da7067-dc1e-4ad2-a73d-a20807c95ec1/0f2bcdae-c472-4f70-8e26-76adfb14e32e/720p.mp4","poster":"https://cdn.ex.co/video-uploads/production/0010J000028svnSQAQ/0f2bcdae-c472-4f70-8e26-76adfb14e32e-thumbnail.jpeg","type":"external-video"}]}}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pt-2 px-0 font-sans font-light text-sm w-full"&gt;Hope Ngumezi and his two children were left to reckon with the death of his wife, Porsha, after she died from complications of a miscarriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="font-sans uppercase text-xs"&gt;Video by Azul Sordo | Staff Photographer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;In April 2023, Porsha Ngumezi, 35, and her husband, Hope, were excited when they found out they were having another baby. The Houston couple had two boys, ages 3 and 5. They were hopeful this baby would be a girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;When Porsha began spotting early in her pregnancy, her obstetrician told her to keep an eye on it, and to go to the emergency room if the bleeding worsened. Porsha had underlying blood conditions, including chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, which causes low platelet counts and put her at a higher risk of bleeding. She also had sickle cell trait and iron deficiency anemia from chronic blood loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;In June, during a family trip to Austin when Porsha was 11 weeks pregnant, the bleeding worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;When they returned home, Porsha headed to Houston Methodist Sugar Land Hospital. Hope watched the boys and planned to meet her at the hospital after their babysitter arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Porsha was admitted at 4:20 p.m., medical records show. A little more than two hours later, when she went to the bathroom to provide a urine sample, she passed numerous clots into the toilet, including what she thought was the fetus, before the toilet auto-flushed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;“I just had a miscarriage in their restroom,” Porsha texted Hope. “I haven’t stopped bleeding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;“Omg,” he responded. “Are they doing something about the bleeding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;“I have to stay. They have to make sure it all passes,” she wrote back, adding she was in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Porsha continued to bleed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;By the time Hope arrived at the hospital, Porsha had been there for around four hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;She began sweating heavily and grew flushed. Her blood pressure plummeted. Emergency department staff gave her fluids before initiating two transfusions of packed red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;A half hour later, she still was passing grapefruit-sized blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Around the same time, hospital records show an emergency room nurse expressed concerns over plans to transfer Porsha to a bed in the less urgent medical-surgical unit. Blood was still gushing out of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Hope told &lt;i&gt;The News&lt;/i&gt; that when he and Porsha met with the OB-GYN, the doctor presented a course of action. He could give Porsha misoprostol, a medication used for abortions and to treat miscarriages, to help her body expel the rest of the pregnancy. If that didn’t work, they would perform a dilation and curettage, or D&amp;amp;C — a procedure commonly used for first-trimester abortions — to stop the hemorrhaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Hope’s mother, who attended medical school, disagreed with that plan. On a phone call with Hope, she had insisted that Porsha needed the D&amp;amp;C, and urgently. Hope, however, knew Houston Methodist was a good hospital system. He trusted they were in good hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;At 10:20 p.m., six hours after Porsha was admitted, she received the misoprostol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Over the next few hours, Porsha repeatedly voiced that something wasn’t right. Again and again, she said her chest hurt, Hope said, even after receiving pain medications. Hope tried to comfort her by rubbing her chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Shortly before 1:30 a.m. — nine hours after Porsha arrived at the hospital — she began gasping for air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Then her heart stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Medical staff rushed in, intubating Porsha and starting chest compressions. They shocked her heart more than 10 times. Hope felt like he was watching them from outside his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;An hour later, Porsha was pronounced dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Hope was in shock. What was he going to tell their sons?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="pt-6 text-center md:py-10 md:text-left"&gt;&lt;img srcset="../assets/images/maternal-deaths-porsha-600.693d5668.jpg 600w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-porsha-1200.9ccb31f2.jpg 1200w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-porsha-1800.68381f82.jpg 1800w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-porsha-2400.b0ee2942.jpg 2400w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-porsha-3000.8f25d783.jpg 3000w" sizes="100vw" src="../assets/images/maternal-deaths-porsha-600.693d5668.jpg" alt="Hope expected to grow old with his wife, Porsha.

Porsha’s heavy bleeding, the experts said, coupled with unstable vital signs, signaled the urgent need for a D&amp;amp;C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;“Delay in care, delay in care, delay in care,” said Bartz, the Harvard physician, of what stands out about Porsha’s case. “Not offering the care that was needed, and ultimately, not listening to the patient, and then the patient’s husband, as it related to what her symptoms were.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Dr. Rebecca Cohen, an OB-GYN practicing in Denver, said Porsha’s underlying blood disorders, known to the hospital staff at the time, could have made her bleeding more dangerous. The large amount of blood loss, Cohen said, clearly signaled an urgent need for a D&amp;amp;C, which works much faster than medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Cohen and other medical experts noted it was impossible to know whether the abortion bans influenced the clinicians who treated Porsha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;But Cohen is confident about one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;“If she had come to the hospital that I work at,” she said, “she would have been alive still.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Other Texas physicians interviewed by &lt;i&gt;The News&lt;/i&gt; admitted medical decision-making in cases involving pregnancy loss has been influenced by fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;“Do I think the law could have contributed to this? Yes, because I think doctors are terrified,” said Dr. Karen Swenson, an OB-GYN who practiced in Austin for almost four decades before retiring in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;In a statement, Houston Methodist said the care of each patient was unique and that it would not comment on Porsha’s care. The hospital system said that it follows all applicable Texas law, including the abortion laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;“As a faith-based system, we have had a long-standing policy regarding appropriate treatment for pregnant women,” the statement said, “including a termination only being performed for the health and safety of the patient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Hope and Porsha were at the hospital for hours. Medical staff, he said, had “all the time in the world” to intervene. He contacted an attorney to investigate her death. A medical malpractice lawsuit was filed in June against the hospital, two doctors and two physician groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;In their responses to the lawsuit, all defendants denied wrongdoing. They wrote the situation was caused by unavoidable circumstances and factors beyond their control, including preexisting health conditions. The case is being litigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Hope expected to grow old with Porsha. Now, he’s facing life as a single father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Hope talks to the boys about their mother every day. He feels like they were robbed of their time with her, of her love and effortless ability to meet their every need. He gave his youngest son a picture of her to help him remain calm at school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;In September, Hope was listening to music in his home office, where he would retreat when the bedroom he had shared with Porsha felt too empty. Suddenly, there was an enormous crash, shaking the entire house. The driver of a pickup truck had plowed through their fence and into the back of the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Hope rushed to check on the boys. Miraculously, both were sound asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;The truck had been headed right for the boys’ room, but at the last second, it veered into Hope’s bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Later, Hope noticed all the framed photos had fallen off the wall. Except for one of Porsha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;He is convinced she was watching over them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto max-w-2xl py-4 text-center md:py-4 px-0 md:text-left font-light text-sm font-sans"&gt;&lt;img srcset="../assets/images/maternal-deaths-porsha-02-600.8d77fc36.jpg 600w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-porsha-02-1200.329ccbea.jpg 1200w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-porsha-02-1800.ade6b85f.jpg 1800w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-porsha-02-2400.355b9fa1.jpg 2400w, ../assets/images/maternal-deaths-porsha-02-3000.cb77d61a.jpg 3000w" sizes="100vw" src="../assets/images/maternal-deaths-porsha-02-600.8d77fc36.jpg" alt="A framed photo of Hope and his wife, Porsha, hangs on a wall of their home in Houston.

Earlier this year, the Texas Legislature made an attempt to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Lawmakers created the Life of the Mother Act, removing some of the penalties doctors faced for providing abortions and allowing them to exercise “reasonable medical judgment” when performing medically necessary pregnancy terminations. The intent of the law, said author Sen. Bryan Hughes, R-Mineola, is to restore physicians’ confidence in treating urgent pregnancy complications under existing abortion restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Whether that will happen, Texas physicians told The News, remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;Even if lawmakers restored abortion rights in Texas, some consequences cannot be undone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;“It’s not going to make Porsha not dead. It’s not going to make Brenda not dead,” said Thaxton, the Denver physician. “Every single day that people can’t access standard of care is a day that people can die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mx-auto max-w-2xl my-6 md:px-0"&gt;&lt;i class="text-gray-dark"&gt;Reporting contributed by Lana Ferguson.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto flex max-w-7xl flex-col items-center space-y-6 pt-10 font-sans md:space-y-8 md:p-10"&gt;&lt;hr class="w-full"&gt;&lt;h1 class="mx-auto flex max-w-7xl flex-col items-center pt-8 font-sans text-2xl font-light uppercase md:pt-9 2xl:text-4xl"&gt;Standard of Fear&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="font-bold text-primary"&gt;Related Stories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Dallas News</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 03:03:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxOV3hiMlhnWW1fNzNTQkxPTDBJZEJfX0lJeFlHekt1eWI3UHBJNnpkcUFKSjlrZE50RmEwVmNzRFFkUVpBX0F2amh4eU9icVNaQ05IT1A2TW1vQmk0aXU4cTZwODU0cE5FeXNGVzBLVU1WdnNERHJiQ3d3U2h0RTJncERHenQtNXh5NFNPNkVRWEd6Y1FTQjZGeS1pamZQM3JCdXducmpkWjRWaVZkcC0wUVNLTjVib19HaWlrOExjZTFWRVZIZG93</guid></item><item><title>许多常见的食用油现在与某些类型的癌症有关- Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxOTWlXRmVFalVXa3VTZjhNamhnazFjVEJfQ0taMzdDXzdQLW9ILU94aE5Ld0dURTd1a2lqZk5hYVRDVGd3NHd1VXY4RWZxakRTcWVtUXRzLVJsUkhQQU0xa3puY3V2WGYwVGlMYWgwU291Mlc2TFRzWE5YSlZFaWxRNDBNMExZeHFiSF9NRkk0UnZYUDRGRkhmdFBSM3dmUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever wondered whether changing your cooking oil could affect cancer growth, you’re not alone. New research shows that the types of fats we eat might influence the rate at which cancer cells multiply. However, it is not as simple as avoiding certain foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picture this: you have cancer, and your doctor advises doing nothing for now. Not yet. That may sound counterintuitive. But that’s exactly what happens to thousands of men with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-proteins-in-blood-may-predict-cancer-years-before-symptoms/"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their tumors grow so slowly that surgery or radiation would hurt more than help. So they wait and undergo regular tests to monitor for changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach, known as “&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/active-surveillance-for-prostate-cancer/about/pac-20384946" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;active surveillance&lt;/a&gt;,” makes medical sense but can be stressful for patients. Men in this situation often ask the same question: Can I do anything to help myself? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study reports part of an answer, and it involves dietary fats found in common cooking oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fats-cooking-oils-and-cancer-cells"&gt;Fats, cooking oils, and cancer cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the typical American diet, we consume too much of one type of fat and not enough of another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-6 fats are common in vegetable oils, fried foods, and many packaged products. Omega-3 fats are abundant in salmon and sardines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Americans eat 15 to 20 times more &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8308533/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;omega-6 than omega-3&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists think a ratio closer to 4:1 would be healthier. This imbalance may increase inflammation, creating conditions that allow cancer cells to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/cancer/members/william-aronson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. William Aronson&lt;/a&gt;, a urology professor at UCLA’s &lt;a href="https://medschool.ucla.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;David Geffen School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, tested whether modifying dietary fat intake could slow cancer growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an important step toward understanding how diet can potentially influence prostate cancer outcomes,” said Aronson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team enrolled 100 men with early prostate cancer who were already on active surveillance, then they assigned the men to two groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half ate their regular diet. The other half worked with a dietitian to eat less omega-6 and more omega-3, and to take fish oil supplements daily. No calorie counting or weight loss was required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many men are interested in lifestyle changes, including diet, to help manage their cancer and prevent the progression of their disease,” Aronson explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that something as simple as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/want-to-slow-down-aging-add-these-foods-to-your-diet/"&gt;adjusting your diet&lt;/a&gt; could potentially slow cancer growth and extend the time before more aggressive interventions are needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracking-tumor-growth"&gt;Tracking tumor growth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers needed a way to measure whether cancer cell growth was slowing. They used a marker called &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/ki-67-proliferation-index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ki-67&lt;/a&gt;, which indicates how quickly cells are dividing. High Ki-67 means cells are multiplying rapidly. Low Ki-67 indicates slower cell division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant received a biopsy at the start and another one year later. Notably, they used MRI guidance to sample the same spot in the tumor both times. Earlier studies often sampled non-targeted areas, making comparisons less precise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one year, the results diverged. Ki-67 levels dropped in the diet change group but rose in the regular diet group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-scientist-discovers-that-common-non-cancer-drugs-when-combined-can-kill-cancer-cells/"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; in the diet change group were dividing more slowly, while cells in the regular diet group were dividing faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some measures did not change: &lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/cancer-center/explaining-psa-numbers-prostate-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PSA levels&lt;/a&gt; and tumor grades remained similar in both groups. That is not unexpected; these measures rarely change over one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fish-oil-and-cancer-cells"&gt;Fish oil and cancer cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some participants left the study due to gastrointestinal side effects from fish oil. Fish oil can interact with blood thinners and other medications. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fish-oil-omega-3-capsules-have-been-found-to-help-control-aggression/"&gt;Use fish oil&lt;/a&gt; only under medical guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, this study does not prove that eating fish will keep you out of the operating room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This significant difference suggests that the dietary changes may help slow cancer growth, potentially delaying or even preventing the need for more aggressive treatments,” Aronson continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a suggestion, not proof; larger, longer studies are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was small and conducted at one hospital. That is enough to prompt interest but not to change clinical guidelines. Still, the researchers examined tumor tissue rather than relying solely on blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those on active surveillance, the practical advice is straightforward. Cut back on fried foods and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/americas-addiction-to-ultra-processed-foods-is-getting-worse/"&gt;ultra-processed snacks&lt;/a&gt;. Eat salmon or sardines twice a week. Consider eggs from hens fed flaxseed. Add chia seeds to breakfast. Small changes can add up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to your doctor before starting fish oil supplements. Product quality varies by brand; choose third-party tested products to minimize contaminants such as heavy metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-first-step-of-many-to-come"&gt;First step of many to come&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific progress is gradual. First, research shows how something works; then clinical studies determine whether it helps patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study addressed the first step – showing that adjusting fat intake by changing oils in your diet was associated with slower cancer cell proliferation in tumor tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step – demonstrating that it prevents cancer spread or delays treatment – remains to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, improving diet is unlikely to cause harm. Unlike radiation or surgery, adjusting fat intake generally carries fewer side effects. Even if cancer benefits are modest, cardiovascular and cognitive health may also improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For men on active surveillance, taking constructive steps can feel better than inaction. The psychological boost of taking control might be just as valuable as any biological benefit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet isn’t magic, and it won’t replace your regular cancer monitoring. According to this research, what you put on your plate may matter more than previously assumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.24.00608" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Clinical Oncology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 02:48:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxOTWlXRmVFalVXa3VTZjhNamhnazFjVEJfQ0taMzdDXzdQLW9ILU94aE5Ld0dURTd1a2lqZk5hYVRDVGd3NHd1VXY4RWZxakRTcWVtUXRzLVJsUkhQQU0xa3puY3V2WGYwVGlMYWgwU291Mlc2TFRzWE5YSlZFaWxRNDBNMExZeHFiSF9NRkk0UnZYUDRGRkhmdFBSM3dmUQ</guid></item><item><title>Intermountain为犹他州的癌症患者提供无纹身选择- KSL TV 5</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0AFBVV95cUxNSXhjbVZKZG9SYXR0V0wya1pKRnVXVDJOT3pGeVp6OXNEaktsMXVwSTRsSVppd0ZQMFVDcGZSdUNTenExTkRUcHlxWmVraVpYaVl1YnBxY0ZFeTR2SDlhRE1lOW1HRGw3LTg5TF96ZWs4NHUyckRQeDNzc0V5SEZjT0k1YW5Jb01JSTdFVmRGMFRxc2ZmcHpvVndqdTdhb0pqOVB6Zk1xV3ZIRnktTE5tUF9iZ2wyTGdHeVdRNWlUcFM0aWQwSHlSQnNNd1lOS2d1?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story_body"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;MURRAY — For cancer patients, radiation therapy can leave more than just scars on the inside. Now, Utah patients can receive cutting-edge treatment without a lasting reminder on their skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, small tattoos were used to guide radiation therapy. But for many patients, these permanent marks can cause anxiety or emotional distress — a daily reminder of their cancer journey. Intermountain Health is the first health system in Utah to eliminate these tattoos, offering a tattoo-less approach to radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Becky Brown of Stansbury Park, the difference is life-changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I actually found a lump under my arm,” said Brown, a mother of three and grandmother of seven. She was diagnosed last year with metastatic breast cancer that had spread to her lymph nodes. Since then, she has endured 12 rounds of chemotherapy, 18 radiation treatments, and continues with immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through it all, Brown said she’s thankful she didn’t have to add one more reminder of cancer to her body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was so happy… I was so pleased I wasn’t going to have little dots tattooed around on me,” she said. “It would be a reminder of everything I’ve been through, and I don’t need any more reminders.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of permanent ink, the new technology — called surface-guided radiation therapy (SGRT) — uses 3D cameras to monitor a patient in real time. Doctors say it’s just as accurate as tattoos, while also creating a smoother and faster treatment process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermountain first launched tattoo-less therapy at Utah Valley Hospital in December 2022 and officially phased out tattoos there by September 2023. Since then, the approach has expanded to Cedar City, St. George Regional, and Intermountain Medical Center in Murray, with plans to be offered statewide by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not everyone is comfortable getting tattoos or permanent ink into their bodies,” said Dr. Rachel Shenker, a radiation oncologist at Intermountain. “We’re making sure that the treatment is being delivered in the most precise and accurate way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shenker added that the innovation is about more than technology — it’s about improving quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They don’t have to have the long-lasting physical scars of their reminder of the radiation treatment, which I think is really important for survivorship,” Shenker said. “To be able to add in some form of ease and comfort and efficiency, I think really helps people on their day-to-day to keep as much normalcy as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Brown, that means moving forward without one more mark of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m so grateful that they have found a new discovery on how to do the radiation and how to make it be successful,” she said. “I didn’t want to get the tattoos, and I didn’t have to.”&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;h1&gt;Naperville Urges Mosquito Precautions After West Nile Virus Found&lt;/h1&gt;
                                              
                &lt;p class="lead"&gt;
Two mosquito traps tested positive for West Nile virus on Oleson Dr. and Jackson Ave.                &lt;/p&gt; 
                &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NAPERVILLE, Ill. —&lt;/strong&gt; Naperville urges residents to prevent mosquito bites and take precautions such as removing standing water after two traps recently tested positive for West Nile virus on Oleson Drive and Jackson Avenue. City crews have sprayed the immediate areas, checked for breeding sites and retreated area catch basins. As a further precaution, the city will spray the areas around the Last Fling festival during the morning of Friday, Aug. 29, to help reduce the mosquito population near the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help prevent mosquitoes from hatching, city crews remove standing water and treat ponds, marshes, and catch basins with safe chemicals during mosquito season from April through October. Crews also monitor traps weekly for West Nile virus and the effectiveness of the treatment. When necessary, the city will use spraying to help control the population of adult mosquitoes. The city uses the safest chemicals at low volumes and sprays only as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne virus transmitted by mosquitoes that feed on infected birds. Most people who are infected with the West Nile virus have no symptoms or experience very mild symptoms three to 14 days after the bite from an infected mosquito. Mild symptoms include a fever, headache and body aches, occasionally with a skin rash on the trunk of the body and swollen lymph glands. Less than 1% of those infected develop severe symptoms, with people over 50 at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precautions to “Fight the Bite”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help prevent mosquito-borne illnesses, reduce mosquitoes around your home and take these precautions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothing, including long pants, long sleeves, shoes with socks from dusk to dawn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use mosquito repellent containing 25% to 35% DEET when outdoors, applied sparingly to skin or clothing, as indicated on the repellent label. Consult a physician before using repellents on young children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check for and repair any tears in residential screens, including porches and patios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate stagnant water in birdbaths, ponds, flowerpots, wading pools, tires and any other receptacles in which mosquitoes might breed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sure to keep roof gutters clear of debris and keep grass cut short and shrubbery well-trimmed around your home to eliminate mosquito hiding places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) have become public enemy number one in nutrition debates. From dementia to obesity and an epidemic of “food addiction”, these factory-made products, including crisps, ready meals, fizzy drinks and packaged snacks, are blamed for a wide range of modern health problems. Some experts argue that they’re “specifically formulated and aggressively marketed to maximize consumption and corporate profits”, hijacking our brain’s reward systems to make us eat beyond our needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policymakers have proposed bold interventions: warning labels, marketing restrictions, taxes, even outright bans near schools. But how much of this urgency is based on solid evidence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleagues and I wanted to step back and ask: what actually makes people like a food? And what drives them to overeat – not just enjoy it, but keep eating after hunger has passed? We studied more than 3,000 UK adults and their responses to over 400 everyday foods. What we found challenges the simplistic UPF narrative and offers a more nuanced way forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two ideas often get blurred in nutrition discourse: liking a food and hedonic overeating (eating for pleasure rather than hunger). Liking is about taste. Hedonic overeating is about continuing to eat because the food feels good. They’re related, but not identical. Many people like porridge but rarely binge on it. Chocolate, biscuits and ice cream, on the other hand, top both lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9" data-video="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iqBPHyJBQQQ?showinfo=0"&gt;&lt;iframe class="ql-video" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iqBPHyJBQQQ?showinfo=0"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted three large online studies where participants rated photos of unbranded food portions for how much they liked them and how likely they were to overeat them. The foods were recognizable items from a typical UK shopping basket: jacket potatoes, apples, noodles, cottage pie, custard creams – more than 400 in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then compared these responses with three things: the foods’ nutritional content (fat, sugar, fibre, energy density), their classification as ultra-processed by the widely used Nova system – a food classification method that groups foods by the extent and purpose of their processing – and how people perceived them (sweet, fatty, processed, healthy and so on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perception power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some findings were expected: people liked foods they ate often, and calorie-dense foods were more likely to lead to overeating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the more surprising insight came from the role of beliefs and perceptions. Nutrient content mattered – people rated high-fat, high-carb foods as more enjoyable, and low-fibre, high-calorie foods as more “bingeable”. But what people believed about the food also mattered, a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perceiving a food as sweet, fatty or highly processed increased the likelihood of overeating, regardless of its actual nutritional content. Foods believed to be bitter or high in fibre had the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one survey, we could predict 78% of the variation in people’s likelihood of overeating by combining nutrient data (41%) with beliefs about the food and its sensory qualities (another 38%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: how we think about food affects how we eat it, just as much as what’s actually in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to ultra-processed foods. Despite the intense scrutiny, classifying a food as “ultra-processed” added very little to our predictive models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we accounted for nutrient content and food perceptions, the Nova classification explained less than 2% of the variation in liking and just 4% in overeating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say all UPFs are harmless. Many are high in calories, low in fibre and easy to overconsume. But the UPF label is a blunt instrument. It lumps together sugary soft drinks with fortified cereals, protein bars with vegan meat alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these products may be less healthy, but others can be helpful – especially for older adults with low appetites, people on restricted diets or those seeking convenient nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9" data-video="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HJC_minQDeQ?showinfo=0"&gt;&lt;iframe class="ql-video" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HJC_minQDeQ?showinfo=0"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message that all UPFs are bad oversimplifies the issue. People don’t eat based on food labels alone. They eat based on how a food tastes, how it makes them feel and how it fits with their health, social or emotional goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relying on UPF labels to shape policy could backfire. Warning labels might steer people away from foods that are actually beneficial, like wholegrain cereals, or create confusion about what’s genuinely unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, we recommend a more informed, personalized approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Boost food literacy: help people understand what makes food satisfying, what drives cravings, and how to recognize their personal cues for overeating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Reformulate with intention: design food products that are enjoyable and filling, rather than relying on bland “diet” options or ultra-palatable snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Address eating motivations: people eat for many reasons beyond hunger – for comfort, connection and pleasure. Supporting alternative habits while maximizing enjoyment could reduce dependence on low-quality foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not just about processing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some UPFs do deserve concern. They’re calorie dense, aggressively marketed and often sold in oversized portions. But they’re not a smoking gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labelling entire categories of food as bad based purely on their processing misses the complexity of eating behavior. What drives us to eat and overeat is complicated but not beyond understanding. We now have the data and models to unpack those motivations and support people in building healthier, more satisfying diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the nutritional and sensory characteristics of food – and how we perceive them – matter more than whether something came out of a packet. If we want to encourage better eating habits, it’s time to stop demonizing food groups and start focusing on the psychology behind our choices.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study in rats reveals that acute stress provokes anxiety-like behaviors, especially in males, while chronic stress is more strongly tied to depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found changes in key blood-brain barrier proteins, showing that stress compromises brain defenses in different ways depending on duration and sex. These findings underline the importance of tailoring mental health prevention and treatment strategies to both stress type and biological differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acute Stress:&lt;/strong&gt; Triggers anxiety-like behaviors, especially in males.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic Stress:&lt;/strong&gt; More strongly linked to depressive symptoms and blood-brain barrier changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Stress impacts male and female brains differently, suggesting tailored interventions are needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;BIAL Foundation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study analyses the negative effects of stress on the brains of male and female rats and concludes that acute stress induces anxiety-like behaviors, especially in males, while chronic stress is moreassociated with depressive symptoms. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these differences may help develop more effective approaches to preventing and treating mental disorders such as anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is well established that stress can increase susceptibility to various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, which are highly prevalent worldwide and represent a significant economic burden and public health issue in our society. The World Health Organization estimated that in 2019, around 970 million people globally – one in eight – suffered from a mental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence also points to sex differences in the prevalence of and responses to stress. In fact, while women account for two-thirds of patients with stress-related disorders, another indicator shows that more than two-thirds of suicide victims are men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although stress is a part of life and, in small doses, can even be beneficial, excessive exposure, whether acute or chronic, can have profound negative effects, especially on the brain, potentially leading to cerebrovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most sensitive targets of excessive stress is the blood-brain barrier, a structure that protects the brain from potentially harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, despite evidence suggesting that different types of stress can compromise its integrity and trigger neuroinflammatory responses associated with various neurological conditions, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the article “Distinct behavioural and neurovascular signatures induced by acute and chronic stress in rats”, published in September in the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;Behavioural Brain Research&lt;/em&gt;, a research team from the University of Coimbra, led by Ana Paula Silva, sought to clarify this issue by analysing the effects of acute and chronic stress in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With support from the BIAL Foundation, the researchers used open field and forced swimming tests to assess locomotor activity and anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in male and female Wistar rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that acute stress induces anxiety-like behaviors, especially in males, while chronic stress is more associated with depressive symptoms. Additionally, changes were observed in key proteins of the blood-brain barrier, with significant sex differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research confirmed that acute stress and so-called chronic mild unpredictable stress induce distinct behavioural and biochemical profiles, highlighting the importance of differentiating stress types and considering biological variables, such as sex, in neuroscience research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows how important it is to understand the differences between types of stress to better grasp the causes of mental disorders like anxiety and depression, and to find more effective ways to prevent and treat these issues”, explains Ana Paula Silva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this stress and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1c6f7d72786e7d326c757268735c7e757d707a736972787d68757372327f7371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sandra Pinto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://bialfoundation.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BIAL Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sandra Pinto – BIAL Foundation&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image:&lt;/strong&gt; The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2025.115706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Distinct behavioural and neurovascular signatures induced by acute and chronic stress in rats&lt;/a&gt;” by Ana Paula Silva et al. &lt;em&gt;Behavioural Brain Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct behavioural and neurovascular signatures induced by acute and chronic stress in rats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress is a contributing factor for several mood disorders, including depression and anxiety which are associated with significant changes in behavioural and cellular domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, sex differences in the prevalence of these neuropsychiatric disorders are well established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence suggests that stress is linked to cerebrovascular diseases and that blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction contributes to the development and exacerbation of neuropathology and neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these interesting findings, very little attention has been given to the effect of both acute and chronic stress (unpredictable chronic mild stress-uCMS) on the link between behavioural and BBB alterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study we used the open field and forced swimming tests (FST) to evaluate locomotor activity, anxiety- and depressive-like behaviours in male and female Wistar rats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western blotting or ELISA were used to quantify the levels of different proteins related to BBB components and neuroinflammation in the prefrontal cortex. We found that acute stress induced anxiety only in males, whereas uCMS had no effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, acute stress decreased immobility time in the FST pointing to a coping strategy in both sexes. In contrast, uCMS increased immobility time only in males, indicating depressive-like behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, both types of stress had no major impact on TNF-α, GFAP and C3/C3aR proteins. Nevertheless, acute stress significantly reduced occludin and VEGF protein levels in both sexes, highlighting significant alterations in the neurovasculature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerning uCMS, there was an upregulation in claudin-5 protein levels only in females suggesting a possible compensatory mechanism of the BBB in response to a prolonged situation of stress. In conclusion, acute and uCMS induce distinct behavioural and biochemical profiles, particularly affecting BBB proteins.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 20:59:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5IX2g3R1lKRXZpMWpPMGpiRjkwa1VRWlQ0T1VselRua0VOT20wd2hlekxFay1hRFpjLVljYnh0WnFzVVJXTFFiNzZFamE3Sk04WFYzdWg3QVBYSW1ya1FmUmM1b0dIM01NdzRqaXFub0Q</guid></item><item><title>包括兰开斯特县（ Lancaster County ）在内的全地区暴露后预期的麻疹病例- LancasterOnline</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi_gFBVV95cUxNQWg0WlF2THNQaUh5bmpaVHAtd3E4dU5DaGdOVHFHWE9sR0RZdU84bUo4VlRTU0IzZ3M1NjZwRW83OE5uc0hFVjk1a1lQQzBxYnU2VDduVjV6dEVRbXdHeGpyZjA5YkQ3YnVyX19INzMxSW9oU3VMX2E5d20tUEFfSnpIQ0pPYU9pRjhURHVxLTd0RVFuVjNXemFiQ2dHZzZaVlQxTEtkeW9Ec0tibzVfVEppbzdDWTFWZkZad3pINUFJSVAzb0trYVctSm9OR2h6R2lWYjdsU3EzTTF5TWR0RXpkTHlnSUFHdm8xcFRRWjEyMzVfOW8teWJ4c0ZyQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;A Penn State Health doctor expects cases of measles to appear in the wake of an out-of-state visitor exposing others at several sites across the region, including one in Lancaster County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the exposures, the state Department of Health issued a warning Thursday and has urged residents to be on alert for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exposures came from a visitor from another state who made stops in four Pennsylvania counties: Adams, Clearfield, Lancaster and York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Lancaster County, those who were at the Midway Mennonite Reception Center, 210 E. Lexington Road, Warwick Township, on Aug. 8 and Aug. 9 may have come into contact with the visitor who was contagious with measles, according to the state Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locations, dates and times of other exposures include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Sapp Bros. Travel Center, 15196 Clearfield Shawville Highway, Lawrence Township, Aug. 5 between 1 and 3 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Farmhouse Restaurant at the Barn Resort, 75 Cunningham Road., Cumberland Township, Aug. 7 between 5 and 8:30 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Hickory Falls Entertainment Center, 110 Hickory Lane, Penn Township, Aug. 7, between 7 and 10 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Garber Mennonite Fellowship, 6082 Old Hanover Road, Heidelberg Township, Aug. 10, between 8:30 a.m. and two hours after the conclusion of services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its 2023 IRS tax filing, Midway Mennonite Reception Center is listed as a tax-exempt 501(c)3 corporation with a mission “to provide a conservative meeting facility for the church and its functions of weddings, funeral meals, ordination meals, special topic meetings, youth gatherings and other church functions and meetings.” A message left with a contact for the center Thursday was not returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="tncms-inline-relcontent tncms-inline-relcontent-bio"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What should I do if I think I have measles?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call ahead before you seek care — the doctor’s office, emergency department or urgent care facility will need to take precautions for your arrival.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you call:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe your symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report any possible measles exposures you’ve had&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask for instructions on how to come in safely&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may also call the Pennsylvania Department of Health at 877-PA-HEALTH to receive guidance on what to do if you were potentially exposed and have symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What to watch for and do&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This most recent exposure emphasizes the importance for parents to ensure that their children are vaccinated against measles,” Dr. Pia Fenimore, a pediatrician at Lancaster Pediatric Associates and vice chair of pediatrics of Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health said by email Thursday. “Exposures cannot be controlled, the best and only defense for measles is vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fenimore added that the vaccine is very safe and effective, and said that reports of autism and other harms are false. Parents who are concerned should speak with their health care provider or seek reliable information from online sources such as such as Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's &lt;a href="http://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine Education Center&lt;/a&gt; or nonprofit organization &lt;a href="http://www.immunize.org" target="_blank"&gt;Immunize.org&lt;/a&gt;, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="tncms-inline-relcontent tncms-inline-relcontent-quote tncms-inline-alignment-right tncms-inline-width-half"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Fahmida McGann&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nine out of 10 people who are vulnerable to measles will get measles."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Dr. Fahmida McGann, infectious disease physician at Penn State Health Lime Spring Outpatient Center&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious known pathogens, said Dr. Fahmida McGann, infectious disease physician at Penn State Health Lime Spring Outpatient Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nine out of 10 people who are vulnerable to measles will get measles,” McGann said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those include people who are unvaccinated, undervaccinated or immunocompromised — a category that McGann said includes people with severe liver disease or uncontrolled diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent exposures, McGann said she expects there to be a couple of cases in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have been exposed to measles and don’t know their vaccination status can receive a dose of the vaccine to help protect them, something that’s usually recommended to be done within 72 hours, McGann said — but this is still a good idea even if more time has passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of the virus here is of particular concern as vaccination rates of kindergarten and seventh grade students in Lancaster County have fallen below the levels needed to maintain herd immunity against measles. During the 2024-2025 school year, rates of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine were 88.5% in kindergarten and 85.4% in seventh grade, according to &lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/health/programs/immunizations/rates" target="_blank"&gt;data from the state Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;. Herd immunity is the level of immunity needed in a population to stop uncontrolled spread of an illness, and is typically considered to be around 95% for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms begin with fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis), followed by a rash that starts on the head and spreads downward, according to the state Department of Health. Without proper protection or supportive care, measles can be deadly. Symptoms can start seven to 21 days after a person was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who believe they were exposed to measles and are experiencing symptoms should contact their health care provider or call the state Department of Health toll-free hotline at 877-PA-HEALTH.

Celebrities from Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston to Hailey Bieber and Kendall Jenner claim that infusion therapy with NAD+, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, makes them feel their best, so it was only a matter of time until the ingredient found its way to the larger cultural conversation, first via &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-nad-supplements" target="_blank"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt; and now, skincare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;’s Favorite NAD+ Skin-Care Products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hsYVHT jBbAVt"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“NAD+ is a molecule found in every cell that helps convert nutrients into energy and supports critical cellular functions like DNA repair, cell signaling, and maintaining healthy metabolism,” explains board-certified dermatologist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://dranettareszko.com/about/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://dranettareszko.com/about/"}' href="https://dranettareszko.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Anetta Reszko&lt;/a&gt;. Just as our collagen reserves deplete with age, so too does NAD+, with almost 50 percent of our NAD+ stores disappearing by age 40, says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.dramandakahn.com/about" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.dramandakahn.com/about"}' href="https://www.dramandakahn.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Amanda Kahn&lt;/a&gt;, board-certified internist and longevity expert. This steep dropoff of NAD+ contributes to oxidative stress, inflammation, and reduced production of cellular energy, or ATP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM fhuYhW"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does NAD+ do for the skin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With less ATP, your cells begin to age faster, and all tissues degenerate more quickly—and that can be especially visible in the skin. “Research suggests that NAD+ helps maintain skin elasticity by promoting collagen and elastin synthesis, improving tissue hydration, and supporting adequate nutrient delivery by supporting the skin’s microvasculature,” explains Dr. Kahn. NAD+ also can help reduce skin inflammation, protect against DNA damage (including the havoc wreaked by UV exposure), and may even help reverse the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM fhuYhW"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does NAD+ skincare actually work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering NAD+ can help boost collagen production and optimize skin health, function, and appearance, it may be a little surprising that the ingredient is only just starting to get top billing in topical products. But there’s a reason for this—NAD+ skincare needs to be developed carefully to work. “Topical NAD+ has limited utility because the molecule is large and unstable, making skin penetration challenging,” says Dr. Reszko.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you may still see localized benefits from cosmetic formulas that contain NAD+, the most effective NAD+ skin-care products tend to contain NAD+ precursors, or ingredients that your body can turn into the buzzy active. One of the most effective NAD+ precursors happens to be one of the most popular ingredients used in skincare today: &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-niacinamide-serums" target="_blank"&gt;niacinamide&lt;/a&gt;. Others include nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and sunflower sprout extract, the latter of which can be found in &lt;a data-offer-url="https://timebeam.com/products/moisture-melt-serum-balm" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/5bwkygcD8TrHAb5QTiQjU9ikfXfQgsAK4fGoX41pbkWCzNj5keZhuXrbKvoPsJtVEjtTHtN346P8k2QnhMbgmcKV9PV8JAb1cTVTT5MigXFoRfLiC3pMnCsVGWhwZ1EznwbyQjXz2Y4PXukXL1hkDHPSuFGwRMGq"}' href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/5bwkygcD8TrHAb5QTiQjU9ikfXfQgsAK4fGoX41pbkWCzNj5keZhuXrbKvoPsJtVEjtTHtN346P8k2QnhMbgmcKV9PV8JAb1cTVTT5MigXFoRfLiC3pMnCsVGWhwZ1EznwbyQjXz2Y4PXukXL1hkDHPSuFGwRMGq" rel="sponsored" target="_blank"&gt;Timebeam Moisture Melt Serum Balm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-offer-url="https://parevabeauty.com/products/coll20%E2%84%A2-gel-cream-moisturizer" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/C5BN9bLtpHgEjQKsgaDWwmhe1GvRy97uvAsTZcSHVxbkg3u5NhdsatyFyb59nMq8o39gaotm3xpiveDd2693bpWHSa8KUkD7d8TjvRPAEUARnJSZgFhyiidGjohMY1EXgWLBq9XRzCQgYJdc8E9TwXxa1d6vfk4VUrN6edDFnYk6q1ueBPMzJ1T"}' href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/C5BN9bLtpHgEjQKsgaDWwmhe1GvRy97uvAsTZcSHVxbkg3u5NhdsatyFyb59nMq8o39gaotm3xpiveDd2693bpWHSa8KUkD7d8TjvRPAEUARnJSZgFhyiidGjohMY1EXgWLBq9XRzCQgYJdc8E9TwXxa1d6vfk4VUrN6edDFnYk6q1ueBPMzJ1T" rel="sponsored" target="_blank"&gt;Parëva COLL20 Gel Cream Moisturizer.&lt;/a&gt; “A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35897147/" target="_blank"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; found that sunflower sprout extract increased cellular ATP production and protected DNA from damage by UV rays, likely by increasing an enzyme that happens to help cells recycle NAD+,” explains Dr. Kahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the best ways to boost your body’s NAD+ levels is by living a healthy lifestyle—sleeping well, eating nutritious foods, exercising regularly (both cardio and strength training), avoiding UV exposure—as well as using supplements and receiving IV drips that contain NAD+.

But what’s most memorable about this essence is its truly unique texture: It’s oddly stretchy, almost like a snail mucin formula, yet isn’t remotely sticky and absorbs beautifully into the skin. Despite the lengthy ingredient list, Numbuzin’s NAD+ essence is gentle (and fragrance-free), making skin look plumper, smoother, and lifted with consistent use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; NAD+, niacinamide, tremella mushroom extract, peptides&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1.69 fl.

It:&lt;/strong&gt; Dry, damaged skin will drink up this nourishing treatment from Aramore, developed with ingredients that Dr. Reszko shares can replenish and protect the moisture barrier while supporting cellular vitality. Barrier-fortifying emollients like shea butter, ceramides, and fatty acids are paired with β-nicotinamide mononucleotide—an ingredient naturally found in your body that your cells use to create NAD+. Somewhere in texture between a serum and a cream, it layers beautifully with other products; the lotion provides lasting moisture, even if you choose to wear it solo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; β-nicotinamide mononucleotide, ceramides, shea butter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1.69 fl.

It:&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-vitamin-c-serum" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin C serums&lt;/a&gt; are runny, sticky, or stinky, but not this one, which combines the potent antioxidant with NAD+ and NAD+ precursors to help firm and brighten skin, says Dr. Reszko. The vitamin C here is tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, an oil-soluble form of the active that’s more stable than traditional L-ascorbic acid. Not only is it better able to penetrate the skin, it’s gentler—and for good measure, the formula also contains fellow free radical fighters ferulic acid and &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-ectoin-skincare" target="_blank"&gt;ectoin&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which helps soothe, repair, and defend against environmental stressors. The result? Healthy, glowing skin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; NAD+, vitamin C, ectoin, ferulic acid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 fl.

prepared to splurge on a solution, consider this set of concentrates from iconic French skin-care brand Biologique Recherche. The ingredient list boasts all 20 amino acids found in the human body (the building blocks of protein, including collagen and elastin), multiple peptides, numerous vitamins, and NAD+ to boost the vitality of even the most depleted complexions, perf Dr. Kahn. You’ll receive 10 vials—for best results, use half of one each day for 20 days, pressing the formula into your skin to maximize absorption.

Covid levels haven't risen to this level nationwide since March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In five states, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/utah/index.html" id="mol-6162bd90-7ea5-11f0-9526-39283337b932"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nevada/index.html" id="mol-61610fe0-7ea5-11f0-9526-39283337b932"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-61626f70-7ea5-11f0-9526-39283337b932"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alaska/index.html" id="mol-615e02a0-7ea5-11f0-9526-39283337b932"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hawaii/index.html" id="mol-615fb050-7ea5-11f0-9526-39283337b932"&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;, Covid levels have now risen to 'very high,' in another warning sign of rising infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schools in these states have already returned from summer vacation, raising transmission rates of the virus, and each state is home to tourism hotspots, which can lead more people to bring the virus to these areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials say the uptick may be driven by the variant, XFG or 'Stratus', that reached the US in March and is not more deadly than previous strains but may be more infectious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Levels of other viruses such as &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-d17a5860-7eb2-11f0-9526-39283337b932"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/rsv/index.html" id="mol-d17bb7f0-7eb2-11f0-9526-39283337b932"&gt;RSV&lt;/a&gt; remain low, CDC monitoring shows, but officials are keeping track of the viruses with the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15021251/Doctors-warn-flu-complication-deadly.html"&gt;official start of the flu season&lt;/a&gt; now just a month away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing the COVID uptick, the CDC said: 'Wastewater monitoring can detect viruses spreading from one person to another within a community earlier than clinical testing and before people who are sick go to their doctor or hospital. It can also detect infections without symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you see increased wastewater viral activity levels, it might indicate that there is a higher risk of infection.' &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Levels of Covid in wastewater are rising nationwide, estimates show, suggesting an uptick in infections in the country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, wastewater data suggested that Covid infections are now rising in 45 states, compared to in 40 over the previous seven-day spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the five states now at very high levels, four are experiencing an uptick compared to the agency's previous data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hawaii has had very high levels of Covid in wastewater for the last three weeks, estimates suggest, as the state records a 'summer wave' of infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hawaii is often ranked as the top tourist destination for Americans in polls, with about 4.6million visiting the state every year, although numbers this year were slightly below those expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid hospitalizations have also risen nationwide, up 30 percent with an estimated 1.3 admissions per 100,000 in the week of July 26, the latest data available, compared to one in the previous seven-day spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths are not rising, however, with 167 fatalities recorded over the week of July 19, the latest available, roughly similar to the level recorded the previous two months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These can take longer to rise, though, because of the time taken for someone to fall seriously ill after being infected and then succumb to the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The figures are far off those at the peak of the pandemic, when there were more than 30 hospitalizations per 100,000 people every week and 25,000 deaths per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the Covid wastewater situation in Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hospital admission rate, or proportion of admissions due to Covid, is rising in four of the five states with very high Covid levels, and fastest in Hawaii, where it rose 17 percent in the week of August 9, the latest available, to 3.4 percent of all admissions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there are no suggestions in any of these states that restrictions may be brought in to curb the spread of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new variant first arrived in the US in March, after appearing in Southeast Asia in January, with some of the first cases reported in New York and New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is a recombinant virus, meaning it was formed when two other strains of Covid infected the same cell and then swapped genes to create a 'chimera' virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organization has classified the strain as a 'variant under monitoring' after lab analysis suggested that it may be more infectious than other currently circulating strains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The XFG variant, formed from two Omicron strains, was behind an estimated 14 percent of Covid cases over the week of June 21, the latest date available, up from 11 percent from two weeks earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC says that it receives little data on variants from the states every year, leading it to have 'low confidence' in the estimates, but it warns that the variant is likely causing an increasing proportion of infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency's wastewater estimates are based on reports from hundreds of sites across the US that analyze the water for signs of Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An uptick indicates more people are shedding the virus, suggesting that infections are rising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes after a&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf430/8236450?login=false"&gt; new study&lt;/a&gt; revealed that even mild Covid infections can age your blood vessels by up to five years, increasing your long-term risk for heart disease, strokes and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Known medically as vascular aging, it sees the blood vessels which carry vital oxygen to organs in the body stiffen and is normal as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But according to the study, which included 2,390 people from 16 different countries, it is accelerated by the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was particularly acute in women, wrote the French researchers in the findings, published in the European Heart Journal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8046164/"&gt;studies &lt;/a&gt;have shown vascular aging to be linked to an increased risk of developing the memory-robbing illness dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf430/8236450?login=true"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;also found people who had been vaccinated against Covid generally had arteries that were less stiff than those who were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And for these people, over the long term, the vascular aging seemed to stabilize or improve slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 19:54:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPNWMybnVqTzBkeHI3YjFVcEg5dHZQREZIbE1kN0hyallCbzR6eHJhaFBOYkVRM0drb3BxSWpqMWJUQzNBRDFLVzRVSEJ4QUQ5RlJLalNxUXZDQTVnbW5VQWE1Q2dvZTBEVUhMX0k2RWlycnl2VElHSGFXWjVxQXhMZk42QlBRRVYzdHVtTVNNcGVhOG5k0gGaAUFVX3lxTE9uRHZBSHpOMU9mc2RHYmE1MXBnTTBsN0poalNEUlh4dHlJYkNLcjZzbktFdzg5WjljYUktWkhMNHB1dFNaTHBLQmFoWkZ3dHZJVktBUFBRS1dROThaRnFQcms1ME5tNzFXQmxfNlBZamR4QjF0SnNZdFdlZWp1RzltbzhBc3dNOHZMODdVaXlJU1FHd3R2YVhRQ1E</guid></item><item><title>今晚睡得更好：科学家揭示了改变游戏规则的30分钟锻炼！ -汤姆的指南</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxNZkFWdHE5UWp0UlZmSjRnYTFLVnc1STZiOXZCeF9haHNiSkNTQjA4aEFjVWdxdTc5VUdJdV9Uei1GSTN3bXlJX21YRG1DWTN0SXJmNHU0V09PakJUMDVuaWd6N3V2Qk1EX1VIRkQ2YzZSa1YzcG1HTTg1MWRlcUYwbDBpbnRUS2h4RmpNRW1JbnZSNWFjS0lTbE1lSnFVZk4wTkpPWEhROUhMTGE3OGxqSA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p id="8eb122c1-d133-4945-8735-067b491fab5d"&gt;A perfect night’s sleep is something that falls on everyone’s wish list at some point. I’ve worked out my own formula—low lights, a book in bed, and my phone nowhere in sight—but I’m always on the lookout for little hacks that might help me get even better-quality shut-eye. Now, thanks to a new study, researchers say yoga could be the one workout you need to sleep better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings come from a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/tag/meta" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/tag/meta"&gt;meta&lt;/a&gt;-analysis published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1584493&amp;amp;xcust=tomsguide_us_7599838751956359664&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fepdf%2F10.1007%2Fs41105-025-00596-7%3Fsharing_token%3DiOnE3aNHziGRPamyr9EZFfe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6z9q-PtZ-h0qeDFDj9tTPA3d4dvjr9cX0cCqpdNiST1d6NbLX-N8P5ssKEYjFD3jE_624JzNi4wo-wngBGR5uszIXcQbvlnWUAachJbqnwoiJNQhAVSLNgCcFxUC1NfDM%253D&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tomsguide.com%2Fwellness%2Ffitness%2Fyoga-beats-all-other-workouts-for-sleep-and-it-only-takes-30-minutes" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s41105-025-00596-7?sharing_token=iOnE3aNHziGRPamyr9EZFfe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6z9q-PtZ-h0qeDFDj9tTPA3d4dvjr9cX0cCqpdNiST1d6NbLX-N8P5ssKEYjFD3jE_624JzNi4wo-wngBGR5uszIXcQbvlnWUAachJbqnwoiJNQhAVSLNgCcFxUC1NfDM%3D" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1584493&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fepdf%2F10.1007%2Fs41105-025-00596-7%3Fsharing_token%3DiOnE3aNHziGRPamyr9EZFfe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6z9q-PtZ-h0qeDFDj9tTPA3d4dvjr9cX0cCqpdNiST1d6NbLX-N8P5ssKEYjFD3jE_624JzNi4wo-wngBGR5uszIXcQbvlnWUAachJbqnwoiJNQhAVSLNgCcFxUC1NfDM%253D&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tomsguide.com%2Fwellness%2Ffitness%2Fyoga-beats-all-other-workouts-for-sleep-and-it-only-takes-30-minutes" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="springer.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;Sleep and Biological Rhythms&lt;/a&gt; journal, which reviewed the results of multiple trials looking at yoga’s impact on sleep.

In fact, the review found the most effective prescription was yoga sessions of 30 minutes or less, done three times per week over 12 weeks.

Start small, anything from 10 to 20 minutes a good starting point to feel the benefits and build confidence before you commit to longer sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that, without a live instructor, you won’t get instant feedback on your form.

              &lt;p&gt;A man who lived with severe, treatment-resistant depression for over 30 years is now in remission, thanks to a new brain stimulation method that targets selective areas of his brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The man reported &lt;a href="https://osf.io/n3u8k/files/osfstorage"&gt;experiencing joy&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in decades after the treatment. “He was crying and saying, ‘I’m not sad, I’m just happy. I don’t know what to do with these emotions’,” the study’s first author, Ziad Nahas, a psychiatrist and professor at the University of Minnesota, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nahas and a team of researchers across several universities developed a personalized method to implant electrodes and precisely send weak electrical signals into brain areas believed to be involved in depression. By fine-tuning this stimulation using the patient’s feedback, the treatment has relieved the participant’s symptoms for up to two years. Their findings are detailed in a new preprint on &lt;a href="https://osf.io/6dpnx"&gt;&lt;i&gt;PsyArXiv&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has not yet been peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;When depression resists treatment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study’s single participant initially contacted the researchers while they were recruiting for a new clinical trial. At the time, he had been living with treatment-resistant depression for three decades, having first been hospitalized at age 13. Since then, he had undergone multiple hospitalizations and tried dozens of treatments alongside intensive psychotherapy. He had also attempted suicide three times.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Treatment-resistant depression is a common form of major depressive disorder that does not improve significantly after at least two standard treatment attempts, such as medications or therapy. In such cases, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)—which stimulates the brain using weak electrical currents—is often considered a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/electroconvulsive-therapy-can-erase-unwanted-memories-1488586221"&gt;next step&lt;/a&gt;. While ECT has been used for decades and can be effective for some patients, it fails for others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this patient’s case, brain stimulation had previously failed to alleviate any symptoms. He had undergone two courses of electroconvulsive stimulation therapy. The first was moderately effective, but the second and third brought no relief.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem is that most ECT studies stimulate specific brain areas based on a standard brain atlas, Damien Fair, a neuroscientist and professor at the University of Minnesota and a study co-author, explained to Gizmodo. That means that researchers don’t often know exactly which area they’re targeting, since everyone’s brain is different. “It’s a one-size-fits-all approach,” said Fair.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A tailored approach&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To address this, the team developed a personalized stimulation method tailored to the participant’s brain. First, they used functional MRI (fMRI) to map the borders of his brain networks previously linked to depression. This revealed that the patient’s salience network, which processes external stimuli, was about four times larger than in people without depression, potentially contributing to his symptoms, Fair said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers surgically implanted four clusters of electrodes into the brain, over the borders of these brain networks. A few days later, they began sending electrical signals into each of the four networks individually.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;When they stimulated the default mode network (DMN), a group of regions linked to internal thought processes, the patient began to experience happiness. Nahas immediately called Fair. “[Nahas] said, ‘You won’t believe it. We stimulated the default network, and [the participant] is breaking down in tears of joy,’” Fair recalled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“In psychiatry, we don’t have cures, but this is probably the closest we can get.”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stimulating the action-mode network, which is involved in planning, and the salience network both led the man to report a sense of calm. Targeting the frontoparietal network, which is involved in decision-making, resulted in improved focus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Over the next six months, the patient received electrical stimulation in the various brain networks each day for 1 minute, every 5 minutes. The researchers continued to adjust the stimulation settings each month using a statistical method that incorporated the patient’s daily feedback.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By seven weeks post-surgery, the participant no longer experienced suicidal thoughts. By six months, his symptoms had significantly improved. By nine months, he had entered full remission. That remission has lasted for two years.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The uniqueness of PACE is combining very precise, individualized targeting of multiple networks and tuning the parameters so the patient can receive the most benefit,” Nahas said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team has since implanted a second participant and plans to implant a third. Ultimately, they aim to conduct a double-blind clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nahas recently received an email from the original participant, who had embarked on a road trip with his family. He was enjoying his trip, he said. “In psychiatry, we don’t have cures,” Nahas said, “but this is probably the closest we can get.”&lt;/p&gt;

She rolled the widows down and listened to music as she drove. But then her vision splintered and she saw multiples in front of her, so she pulled over for the roughly 10 seconds it lasted. After calling her brother, she decided to go to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6f3b17" class="body-graf"&gt;“The ER doctor asked me a bunch of questions,” she recalls. Initially, “everything that I answered didn’t seem to alarm him.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-86082c" class="body-graf"&gt;But then he inquired if she felt numbness, and she said she had “a little teeny bit" along her jawline. That response “concerned him,” so he sent her for the scans. Rodrigues felt surprised that when he returned, he was so certain of the diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7efb88" class="body-graf"&gt;“He said, ‘I know what’s going on with you,’ which I hate hearing that from doctors because that means they absolutely know what it is,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-26cd37" class="body-graf"&gt;He told her she had Stage 4 lung cancer that spread to her brain. Rodrigues felt stunned because she had no symptoms at all and had not smoked for decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1aeb4f" class="body-graf"&gt;“I am generally in excellent health,” she says. In fact, the year before her diagnosis, she'd had a lung x-ray because of a flutter in her heart, and it didn't detect anything in her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9539f2" class="body-graf"&gt;The emergency room doctor admitted Rodrigues to the hospital so she could undergo more testing to determine what type of lung cancer she had. Scans revealed the cancer had spread from a nodule in her lung to her liver, the base of her spine, to two ribs and her brain, where she had 47 metastases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-94a80c" class="body-graf"&gt;“There was an element of shock in there,” she says. “I’ve gratefully had a meditation practice for a really long time, and the very first thing that struck me when he said (my full diagnosis) was like, ‘Oh that’s what they’ve been talking about all this time, about impermanence.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-6b1680"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1864"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-03-4fd22a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-03-4fd22a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-03-4fd22a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-03-4fd22a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-03-4fd22a.jpg" alt="After a brief visual disturbance, Tania Rodrigues visited the emergency room and learned she had Stage 4 lung cancer with 47 metastases in her brain."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;After a brief visual disturbance, Tania Rodrigues visited the emergency room and learned she had Stage 4 lung cancer with 47 metastases in her brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Tania Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d01ec0" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors characterized her visual impairment as a seizure, even though she didn’t experience other symptoms, and they put her on an anti-seizure medication. Rodrigues cancer was a type that occurs more often in people who have never smoked, called EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e70094" class="body-graf"&gt;Rodrigues qualified for a targeted therapy, and every day, she took a pill until it became ineffective in December 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-64fc54" class="body-graf"&gt;“It worked as long as it worked and then it stopped working,” she says. “But the good news was that it got rid of almost every single brain metastases.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9cc11b" class="body-graf"&gt;Another node on her lung has appeared, though, and the metastasis on her liver returned. Her team of doctors recommended another targeted therapy and chemotherapy, which she receives in an infusion once every three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ac7606" class="body-graf"&gt;“This has been great,” she says. “The second node on my lung is gone. The primary node is reduced.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-607aa1" class="body-heading"&gt;Non-Smoking Lung Cancer on the Rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-840427" class="body-graf"&gt;As the number of people who smoke has decreased, so has the number of people with smoking-caused lung cancer. At the same time, experts have noticed an increase in young people, mostly women, with non-smoking lung cancers, Dr. Danny Nguyen, a medical oncologist and hematologist at City of Hope in California, tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a671c0" class="body-graf"&gt;The causes of lung cancer in non-smokers remain unclear, and researchers are trying to understand why it occurs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b28f33" class="body-graf"&gt;“In terms of risk factors, I think it’s hard to really pinpoint right now,” Nguyen says. “Some of these risk factors include potentially radon (exposure), pollutants in the air.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-996069" class="body-graf"&gt;Non-smokers who get lung cancer often have a mutation in a gene called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, which can cause the cancer to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-431e42"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="2032"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-04-07b7fa.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-04-07b7fa.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-04-07b7fa.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-04-07b7fa.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/non-smoking-lung-cancer-zz-250821-04-07b7fa.jpg" alt="Since being diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer, Tania Rodrigues appreciates the beauty of life more."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Since being diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer, Tania Rodrigues appreciates the beauty of life more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Tania Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-885ec2" class="body-graf"&gt;Several targeted therapies work effectively on managing Stage 4 EGFR lung cancers. A recent phase 3 clinical trial shows that a combination of two therapies, Rybrevant and Lazcluze, increased survival for patients with metastatic lung cancer, he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e19f8e" class="body-graf"&gt;“We definitely have those patients that are on that trial who are still alive right now because of that trial,” Nguyen says. “There are many other clinical trials for lung cancer as well.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0960ea" class="body-graf"&gt;Having treatments that work for patients diagnosed later remains essential as many people do not have symptoms until their cancer has progressed. Even then, the most common symptoms, such as a cough, are usually a sign of more benign conditions, and doctors often consider those before lung cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cbaf7a" class="body-graf"&gt;“What I’ve seen is a lot of these patients may present with a cough that just doesn’t go away,” Nguyen says. “They try antibiotics, they try inhalers and try steroids. It maybe gets better for a little bit then comes right back.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-76956b" class="body-graf"&gt;Current screening recommendations for lung cancer only apply to smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84329d" class="body-graf"&gt;“A lot of times these patients don’t look like they should have lung cancer,” Nguyen says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f91f2" class="body-graf"&gt;Many patients are like Rodrigues and learn they have cancer when a scan for something else picks up a mass in the lungs. Doctors should consider lung cancer especially if patients present with symptoms — such as coughing up blood or a persistent cough — because it can impact anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-083711" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you have lungs, you can get lung cancer,” Nguyen says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-34a4ab" class="body-heading"&gt;‘My Life is Full’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc6620" class="body-graf"&gt;Thanks to her years of meditation, Rodrigues quickly accepted that rest of her life will always include cancer treatments.

The resident is believed to have been bitten by an infected flea while camping in South Lake Tahoe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The infected individual is recovering at home and is receiving medical care, El Dorado County officials said in &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.eldoradocounty.ca.gov/County-Government/Countywide-Press-Releases/Resident-Tests-Positive-for-Plague" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a press release;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Plague is naturally present in many parts of California, including higher elevation areas of El Dorado County,” Kyle Fliflet, El Dorado County’s acting director of public health, said in the release. “It’s important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking and or camping in areas where wild rodents are present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though extremely rare, humans may still contract the plague. Prior to the current case, the most recently reported case in El Dorado County was in 2020. Exposure was also likely to have occurred in the South Lake Tahoe area. Two individuals were reported with the human plague in 2015 in Yosemite National Park when they were exposed to infected rodents or their fleas. Those were the first reported human cases in the state since 2006. All infected individuals have since recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Outside of California, a human case of the plague was detected in Pueblo County, Colo., &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/colorado-public-health-officials-confirm-230630545.html" data-ylk="slk:in July 2024;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;in July 2024&lt;/a&gt;.

Swollen lymph nodes, also known as buboes, appear in the armpits, groin or neck with this type of plague. The size of these buboes vary between less than half an inch to about 4 inches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additional symptoms of bubonic plague can include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sudden high fever and chills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Headache, tiredness and not feeling well in general&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Skin sores (in rare cases)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Septicemic plague&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Septicemic plague happens when plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream. Buboes may not be present in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Early symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sudden high fever and chills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Extreme weakness, stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More serious symptoms can develop with advanced disease and organ failure. These symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bleeding from the mouth, nose or rectum, or under the skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Signs of shock, such as seizure, rash and low blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Blackening and death of tissue (gangrene), most commonly affecting fingers, toes, ears and nose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pneumonic plague&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pneumonic plague affects the lungs. While it may begin in the lungs, the disease can also spread from infected lymph nodes to the lungs. Symptoms can show up within hours after exposure and quickly worsen. These symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sudden high fever and chills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Difficulty or irregular breathing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chest pain, headache and weakness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Upset stomach and vomiting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-common-is-the-plague"&gt;How common is the plague?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The risk of getting the plague is very low, according &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/plague/symptoms-causes/syc-20351291" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to the Mayo Clinic;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;to the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.

That means younger patients who are not immunocompromised will be unable to get the shot, experts warn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“If you’re under 65 and not high risk, the window to get a Covid-19 vaccine is right now — before the FDA label changes,” epidemiologists Katelyn Jetelina and Hannah Totte wrote Monday in their Substack &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/covid-19-vaccine-label-change-alpha"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. “Once it happens, access will be limited immediately (if it isn’t already).” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Their warning was followed by predictions from other medical professionals that widespread access to various Covid vaccines will be cut off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“Many people have conditions that would qualify them as higher risk for Covid and therefore eligible for the updated vaccine, BUT they may change this list and make it much more restricted when they change the FDA label,” Dr. Lucky Tran, a biochemist, posted on&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/luckytran/status/1957922149345231217"&gt; X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Details about whom the FDA will consider “high risk” haven’t been released. Representatives of the agency did not respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Over the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-modeling-and-forecasting/rt-estimates/index.html"&gt;last three weeks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, Covid rates have surged across much of the United States, with the highest concentrations detected in the West. Wastewater levels for Covid are peaking in Alaska, California, Hawaii, Texas, Nevada, and Utah, according to &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html"&gt;the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;San Francisco is caught in the surge. The risk of Covid is “high” throughout the city, according to data from &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/?plantId=e9e87e61&amp;amp;selectedLocation=%7B%22label%22%3A%22Southeast%20San%20Francisco,%20CA%22,%22level%22%3A%22plant%22,%22value%22%3A%22e9e87e61%22%7D&amp;amp;charts=CjIQACABSABaBk4gR2VuZXIKMjAyNS0wNy0xMHIKMjAyNS0wOC0yMYoBBjhmMDQ4YsABAQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=8f048b&amp;amp;target=N%20Gene&amp;amp;locationExpanded=true"&gt;wastewater treatment plants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Influenza and RSV rates are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“We’re in an unfortunate limbo, created by an administration that’s uncommitted to vaccines,” said Matt Willis, the former Marin County public health officer, alluding to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/07/health/kennedy-vaccines-mrna-trump.html"&gt;casting doubt on immunizations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. “So, I’m worried the federal foot-dragging will get us the vaccine late and that it will be too narrow in who can get it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Amid the uncertainty, San Francisco health officials have adopted a cautious position. The Public Health Department urged residents to stay up to date on Covid vaccinations, noting that anyone who has not yet received the 2024–25 vaccine should do so immediately. The agency recommends two doses for those 65 and older or immunocompromised. Officials also advise people to consider wearing well-fitted masks in crowded indoor spaces and to stay home if sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“We continue to monitor federal vaccine guidance for the upcoming 2025–26 respiratory virus season,” the department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Kennedy has narrowed access to Covid shots. In May, he updated guidelines that &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/08/nx-s1-5459978/rfk-jr-vaccine-pediatrics-public-health-lawsuit"&gt;removed pregnant women and healthy children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; from the vaccine schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Once updated guidelines are rolled out, pharmacies will dispose of any unused doses of the 2024–25 Covid vaccine, according to UCSF immunology expert Dr. Peter Chin-Hong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Even people who remain eligible for the vaccine may be less likely to get it because of confusion over who qualifies, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;On Aug. 19, the American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/health/covid-vaccine-recommendation-aap"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Covid shots for all children ages 6 to 23 months, a stronger stance than the CDC’s recommendation, which leaves the choice to parents and providers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Deaths and hospitalizations from Covid among children are likely to rise under the new vaccine rules, according to Chin-Hong. CDC data show children under 2 accounted for 57% of pediatric Covid hospitalizations in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“What happens is no one gets it, because patients are confused,” Chin-Hong said of the vaccine. “It’s the people who are vulnerable who get caught up in the confusion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The San Francisco Standard</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 18:28:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9yUWFrQlBPeU4zWEQxNzhtdkd1ZFhsVXBXWDJoa2lpWkhiYjd0ek1DbzBnQlk5eTVJUE8xWl9GWEF5VDhTZE56ZXZHZjgzZXBnMU81blNOQTR3c2lNaUZMM2dPSmtBQU1kVU9JZFh3</guid></item><item><title>TikTok的宿醉解决方案正在蔓延。是否有任何证据证明它真的有效？ - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE42ZWpNRGtYcVBxNlc0NDYyQTZLNzNlWS1MS3VjY1o5MWU0VWktYzlHaWgwQW9TbUhxNF8xQ0FkVlAtSnJZczJyc3RGb1Q0SVFZazhEeXRKYWsxVmgxWC1YcHVtQU1WZnJkZWlLNllyRUlvTDJSWkZTT05zcw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Don't Give Into TikTok's New Hangover Cure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Thales Antonio / EyeEm - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIKTOK IS BACK&lt;/strong&gt; with another life hack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new clip is going viral for proclaiming it has found the "cure" for hangovers...by sticking your face in a bowl of ice water for as long as you possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With over 4 million views, this cold plunge for your face has plenty of people talking and trying it out. But have we actually found a cure for Sunday morning's most predictable problem?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "cure" everyone is raving about is actually the effects of the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538245/#:~:text=The%20diving%20reflex%20commonly%20referred,in%20response%20to%20water%20submersion." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mammalian diving reflex;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mammalian diving reflex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can thank our reflexes for helping us pull our hand off a hot pan before we give ourselves third degree burns, or for jumping our muscles into play to stabilize us when we fall off a curb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the diving reflex happens when we are submerged under water, or when cold water is applied to the face. Physiologically, our body conserves energy to ensure survival by shutting down certain functioning. Basically, it's our body's emergency response team making sure we don't drown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processes that are not essential, such as digestion, stop in order to conserve oxygen for more vital organs, like our brain and heart. Our heart rates decrease to minimize the flow of blood to the less important pieces of our body, like our reproductive and gastrointestinal organs. Interestingly, some of these organs can &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1114253/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:last for days;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;last for days&lt;/a&gt; without oxygen (part of the reason why we can do organ transplants). Our brain, however, cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a heavy night of drinking, you're probably battling a hefty bout of nausea and hang-xiety (that's hangover anxiety, in case you haven't had to endure it). When you stick your face in cold water, as in the TikTok video, processes that cause those torturous hangover symptoms are inhibited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since your digestion slows down, you may feel less nauseous after the face bath. And with your heart rate decreasing to limit blood flow, you may feel like your anxiety is lightening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But "cure" is a strong word. These effects may help, but probably only in the short-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no scientific evidence supporting that this method will be effective or safe. Currently there are no proven effective and safe hangover treatments," says &lt;a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/pharmacology/research/joris-verster" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Joris Verster;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Joris Verster&lt;/a&gt;, Ph.D., founder of the Alcohol Hangover Research Group and principal investigator at the Division of Pharmacology at Utrecht University.

							&lt;p data-start="326" data-end="477"&gt;Longevity without vitality isn’t much of a win. Living to 90 only matters if you can still walk, laugh, and create memories with the people you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="479" data-end="696"&gt;What’s interesting is that many people who thrive into their 90s don’t start off as perfect models of health. Instead, they make key changes later in life—often after 60—that set them up for a vibrant final chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="698" data-end="759"&gt;Here are eight habits that tend to show up again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="766" data-end="807"&gt;1. They keep moving every single day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="809" data-end="982"&gt;We all know exercise matters, but here’s the twist: the 90+ crowd rarely turns into gym rats. Instead, they focus on movement they enjoy—walking, gardening, yoga, tai chi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="984" data-end="1258"&gt;Dan Buettner, who studied the &lt;a href="https://danbuettner.com/evidence-of-longevity/?.com"&gt;world’s Blue Zones&lt;/a&gt;, found that the longest-lived people don’t “work out” in the modern sense. They simply move naturally throughout the day. As he put it, “Longevity happens to people who have the right lifestyle, not the right genetic code.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1260" data-end="1494"&gt;I’ve noticed this on my own travels. In small towns in Italy, I watched men and women in their 70s and 80s walk to the market every day. It wasn’t exercise—it was life. And that consistency, multiplied over decades, builds vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1496" data-end="1671"&gt;The key here is sustainability. It’s not about pushing yourself to the brink in a spin class. It’s about weaving movement into your life so that it never feels like a chore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1678" data-end="1709"&gt;2. They eat with intention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1711" data-end="1880"&gt;This doesn’t mean they follow the latest fad diet. Instead, they make conscious choices about food. Smaller portions, more plant-based meals, fewer processed products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1882" data-end="2127"&gt;One friend of mine switched to mostly plant-based eating at 65 after his doctor warned him about cholesterol. Now in his 80s, he bikes with his grandkids. He swears it’s not just what he cut out, but what he added in—beans, leafy greens, nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2129" data-end="2454"&gt;Science backs him up. Research shows that people who adopt &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190807092326.htm?.com"&gt;plant-forward diets&lt;/a&gt; later in life still reap the benefits, including better heart health and lower inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2456" data-end="2650"&gt;And let’s be real: at 60, food often becomes less about indulgence and more about function. People who thrive past 90 learn to see food as fuel for tomorrow rather than just comfort for today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2657" data-end="2697"&gt;3. They maintain a learning mindset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2699" data-end="2780"&gt;What keeps you sharp into your 90s isn’t just crossword puzzles—it’s curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2782" data-end="2985"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before, but when I interviewed a retired teacher in her late 80s, she said the secret to her energy was “never stopping school.” She still takes online courses and joins book clubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2987" data-end="3221"&gt;The brain, like a muscle, responds to use. Psychologist Carol Dweck’s research on &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/04/gs-04thinkpositive/?.com"&gt;growth mindset&lt;/a&gt; applies here: people who believe they can keep learning actually do. And that belief translates into vitality well past retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3223" data-end="3530"&gt;I’ve seen this in small but powerful ways. A man I know in his late 80s started learning Spanish at 70 because he wanted to travel. He never became fluent, but the process itself kept his mind sharp. He still jokes, “I know just enough Spanish to order a beer anywhere in Mexico—and that’s enough for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3537" data-end="3581"&gt;4. They build strong social connections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3583" data-end="3777"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-power-and-prevalence-of-loneliness-2017011310977?.com"&gt;Loneliness is as damaging to longevity&lt;/a&gt; as smoking a pack a day. That’s not my opinion—that’s data from the Harvard Study of Adult Development, one of the longest-running studies on human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3779" data-end="3930"&gt;Those who live longest often invest heavily in relationships. They stay connected to old friends, make new ones, and engage with younger generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3932" data-end="4120"&gt;When I visited Okinawa, Japan—a region famous for its elders—I noticed how many people over 80 still meet daily for tea or small community projects. They laugh. They gossip. They belong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4122" data-end="4189"&gt;That sense of belonging, more than any supplement, sustains them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4191" data-end="4418"&gt;And here’s a small but important detail: they don’t just wait for others to reach out. They initiate. They call, they invite, they check in. It’s this proactive approach that turns acquaintances into lifelong support systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4425" data-end="4473"&gt;5. They cultivate flexibility, not rigidity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4475" data-end="4614"&gt;This one surprised me at first. We think of older people as “set in their ways.” But the vibrant 90-somethings I’ve met are the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4616" data-end="4716"&gt;They adapt. They pick up new hobbies, try new foods, and embrace technology instead of fearing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4718" data-end="4902"&gt;A neighbor of mine started photography at 68. Now he’s 92 and still takes better photos than I do. He says, “The moment you stop trying new things is the moment you start shrinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4904" data-end="5121"&gt;Psychologists would call this &lt;a href="https://ai.hubermanlab.com/s/9oeGu5FI?.com"&gt;cognitive flexibility&lt;/a&gt;—the ability to adapt thinking and behavior to new situations. It’s one of the strongest predictors of both mental sharpness and emotional resilience in later life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5123" data-end="5331"&gt;And it doesn’t always look grand. Sometimes it’s as simple as learning how to FaceTime the grandkids or experimenting with a plant-based recipe. Each small act of openness compounds into long-term vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5338" data-end="5370"&gt;6. They protect their sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5372" data-end="5547"&gt;Sleep often gets ignored in longevity conversations, but it’s a core pillar. Studies link &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sleep-well-and-reduce-your-risk-of-dementia-and-death-2021050322508?.com"&gt;poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; with higher risk of dementia, cardiovascular problems, and faster aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5549" data-end="5737"&gt;Interestingly, many people I’ve spoken with didn’t get serious about sleep until later in life. After years of late nights and stressful jobs, they finally realized rest wasn’t optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5739" data-end="5927"&gt;One 91-year-old I know swears by her evening ritual: herbal tea, dim lights, no screens after 8. “I wasted decades on too little sleep,” she told me. “Now I treat bedtime like medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5929" data-end="6179"&gt;And she’s not alone. Sleep scientists note that older adults who create &lt;a href="https://internal.mesa-nhlbi.org/participants/discoveries/better-sleep-longer-life-benefits-regular-and-sufficient-sleep-pattern?.com"&gt;consistent bedtime routines&lt;/a&gt; not only live longer but live sharper. Sleep is when the brain clears toxins, when the body repairs itself. Miss it, and vitality slowly slips away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6186" data-end="6229"&gt;7. They find purpose beyond themselves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6231" data-end="6388"&gt;Viktor Frankl wrote, “Those who have a ‘why’ to live, can bear almost any ‘how.’” Purpose is not just a poetic idea—it’s linked to longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6390" data-end="6579"&gt;And here’s the thing: purpose doesn’t have to mean starting a foundation or writing a book. For many, it’s about caring for family, volunteering, mentoring, or even just tending a garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6581" data-end="6765"&gt;After 60, people who thrive into their 90s often reframe their identity. They’re no longer “retired,” they’re contributors in a new way. That sense of purpose anchors their vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6767" data-end="7010"&gt;I once met a man in Greece who was well into his 80s and still ran a small community choir. He said he could have quit years earlier, but “the music keeps me alive.” That struck me. Purpose doesn’t need to be grand—it just needs to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7017" data-end="7057"&gt;8. They manage stress intentionally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7059" data-end="7130"&gt;Nobody escapes stress. But those who stay vibrant learn to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7132" data-end="7326"&gt;Some lean on meditation, others on prayer, others on simply spending more time in nature. I’ve seen people shift from high-stress jobs to slower living and flourish in ways they didn’t expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7328" data-end="7574"&gt;As noted by Dr. Elissa Epel, a stress researcher at UCSF, “How we respond to stress is more important than the stress itself.” People who develop calming practices—even late in life—protect their bodies from the wear and tear of chronic stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7576" data-end="7853"&gt;And crucially, they don’t just &lt;em data-start="7607" data-end="7614"&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; stress—they build resilience. I met a woman who started practicing tai chi at 70. She told me, “It’s not about eliminating stress. It’s about giving my body and mind a rhythm to return to.” That rhythm has carried her well into her 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7860" data-end="7880"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7882" data-end="8013"&gt;The habits that fuel a long, vibrant life don’t require perfection. They require small, consistent shifts that compound after 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8015" data-end="8102"&gt;Movement. Food. Curiosity. Connection. Flexibility. Rest. Purpose. Stress management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8104" data-end="8150"&gt;Not glamorous, not trendy, but deeply human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8152" data-end="8202"&gt;And the best part? It’s never too late to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

Symptoms typically appear within two weeks of exposure and include fever, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes, the release noted. If detected early, plague can be effectively treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;CDPH said that it routinely monitors rodent populations across California for plague activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The department said that surveillance in El Dorado county from 2021 through 2024 identified a total of 41 rodents that showed evidence of exposure to the plague bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So far in 2025, four rodents have tested positive, county officials said, adding that they were all within the Tahoe Basin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This week’s case is not the region’s first brush with plague. The last confirmed human case in El Dorado county was in 2020, the statement added, and was also believed to be linked to the South Lake Tahoe area. Before that, the release says that two cases were reported in 2015&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/07/california-child-diagnosed-plague-yosemite" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; after exposure in Yosemite national park&lt;/a&gt;.

That means measles is likely spreading more, said Dr. Christine Hahn, Idaho’s state epidemiologist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Without any link between these two confirmed cases in north Idaho or travel outside of their communities, it’s reasonable to suspect that there is more measles circulating,” Hahn said in a statement. “As we’ve seen with other states around the nation, cases can begin to multiply quickly.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Idaho’s three measles cases are all in unvaccinated children. Vaccination is the best way to prevent measles, which is highly contagious and usually leads to hospitalization for one in five children younger than 5 years old who are infected. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, eastern Idaho health officials confirmed a measles case in Bonneville County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eastidahonews.com/2025/08/first-confirmed-measles-case-in-eastern-idaho-resident-since-1991/"&gt;RELATED | First confirmed measles case in eastern Idaho resident since 1991&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But officials said they didn’t think the public was exposed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/08/14/measles-reported-in-eastern-idaho-becoming-states-second-case-in-one-week/"&gt;In both regions of Idaho that have seen measles cases this year&lt;/a&gt;, the infections are the first reported in more than three decades and came shortly after early signs of the virus locally. Idaho hasn’t reported local measles cases since 2023, when an outbreak in southwest Idaho led to 10 infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. is experiencing the worst outbreak of measles in decades. This year, health officials have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; 1,375 measles cases across 41 states by Tuesday, according to the Centers for Disease Control, or CDC. About 13% of measles cases in the U.S. this year led to hospitalizations, the CDC reports. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Officials encourage people to verify vaccination records&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious but rare. Up to 90% of non-immune people in contact with an infected person can become infected. The virus can live in the air up to two hours after someone infected leaves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html"&gt;Symptoms typically appear&lt;/a&gt; seven to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a distinctive rash, the CDC says. While many recover without problems, measles can lead to serious complications, especially in very young children and people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials encourage people to verify their family’s vaccination records with their primary care provider or through the Docket App. A person is considered immune if they were born before Jan. 1, 1957, have a documented history of laboratory-confirmed measles or have documentation that they received both doses of the MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Idaho has a &lt;a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/briefs/traveler-visiting-eastern-idaho-had-measles-but-officials-dont-think-the-public-was-exposed/#:~:text=But%20Idaho%20has%20a%20spotty%20record%20for%20measles%20vaccinations%2C%20the%20Sun%20previously%20reported.%C2%A0"&gt;spotty record for measles vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The virus’s serious complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain) and, in rare cases, death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with measles symptoms should not enter health care settings without calling ahead, and they should contact their health care providers. People exposed to measles should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no antiviral treatment for measles, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:49:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0AFBVV95cUxNLV9QSTVyNXRjMWlrdy1uQUhJWFp3bHprUThRbHBYTFUwaE9oSDFEWVR1OG1kN283R1kyZUQ2OWhsR3FDdlQwb19uRDZHOUdKTC1OUFBSQV8tdUdwQnpGS1NLSEQ1NkRfY3BqLXVHckZ2NlAzYWtxYjB5X1ZReFhOSl96RGdoamZZU29mSnZRYlhPRkF3MjM4R0ZqQzV2SC1yQVdJRS04R015TE14cUlXbzBFRS1ScC1WeW4tNDdXY0FNcnJfUFcxSDhGQTY0NnQ5</guid></item></channel></rss>
