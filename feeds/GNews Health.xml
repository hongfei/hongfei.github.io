Eating out, going to social events and travelling abroad are all fraught with anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As many as one in 200 adults and one in 50 children have a nut allergy, charities say. Some children grow out of their allergies, but many don't - and they continue into adulthood, often getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;An allergic reaction occurs when the body reacts to the protein in peanuts, thinking it's a threat, which triggers a sudden release of chemicals. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/food-allergy/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Symptoms can range from the mild to very serious&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Chris's allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Each reaction since has been worse than the one before, which means he's become accustomed to living every day "on high alert hoping nothing bad happens". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Activities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Despite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London that would change her son's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Despite being "really nervous", Chris agreed to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;From milligrams to whole nuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;In the trial, patients were started on tiny amounts of peanut powder to slowly build up their tolerance&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Under the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt. Over many months, the amount of peanut was gradually increased, slowly building up to Chris eating fractions of nuts and, finally, whole nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;By the end of the nine-month study, 14 of the 21 patients could eat the equivalent of five peanuts without having allergic reactions - including Chris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Professor Stephen Till, who led the research, says the treatment "has potential to have a real impact on patients' lives".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Most severe reactions occur because of mistakes, usually by somebody else, and miscommunication. So it provides them with some protection against that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"They've taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It's only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostly &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-64987074" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;in children&lt;/a&gt; whose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away," says Prof Till. "Those young people are going to become adults, so we need treatments for adults too." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journalallergy.com/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;This trial, published in the journal Allergy,&lt;/a&gt; shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b656/live/b7abe130-1f8d-11f0-a007-45ee4cc6069d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b656/live/b7abe130-1f8d-11f0-a007-45ee4cc6069d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b656/live/b7abe130-1f8d-11f0-a007-45ee4cc6069d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b656/live/b7abe130-1f8d-11f0-a007-45ee4cc6069d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b656/live/b7abe130-1f8d-11f0-a007-45ee4cc6069d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b656/live/b7abe130-1f8d-11f0-a007-45ee4cc6069d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b656/live/b7abe130-1f8d-11f0-a007-45ee4cc6069d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b656/live/b7abe130-1f8d-11f0-a007-45ee4cc6069d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Chris Brookes-Smith Chris lies in a hospital bed, holding up a peanut as he prepares to eat it as part of the clinical trial into desensitising peanut allergies" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Chris Brookes-Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Medical help was always on hand when Chris upped his dose of peanut during the study&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Chris had no idea how he would react to even the slightest trace of peanut.

"The big jump in fear was going from peanut dust to half a whole nut." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But he was reassured by having a team of doctors and nurses present, with drugs such as adrenaline standing by in case of a severe, life-threatening reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"You've got 100 eyes on you - nothing is gonna happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, experts stress no one should try this at home on their own because of the risk of a serious allergic reaction occurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;'Wonderful feeling'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Not everyone who tried the treatment was desensitised, and larger trials in more people will have to work out why that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"For some people, there were reactions and we had to slow down or go back a step," explains Prof Till.

                                        Your child may fear the monster under their bed. They'd be smarter to fear the air around it, or so suggests a &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.5c00051"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/15/health/child-mattress-bedding-toxins-wellness/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; reports researchers who analyzed the air in the bedrooms of 25 kids between the ages of 6 months and 4 years found "worrisome" levels of more than two dozen phthalates, flame retardants, and UV filters—particularly near the bed. To determine why, they launched a &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.5c03560"&gt;companion study&lt;/a&gt; in which they evaluated 16 new lower-cost children's mattresses to determine whether they were off-gassing the chemicals. The did indeed find them to be a source of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). The &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/21/children-mattresses-toxic-chemicals-research"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; explains that semi-volatile means "they can lift off objects and seep into the air over time."
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                                        They then tested and confirmed an additional hypothesis: that children's body heat and weight, which is a realistic scenario, would increase emissions and hence exposures." That's "a factor that current safety standards don't consider," said Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, who was not part of the study. The researchers also noted that children's exposure to SVOCs and other environmental contaminants exceeds that of adults due to "their 10-times higher inhalation rate, 3-times larger skin surface area per body weight compared to adults, and their unique behaviors such as frequent hand-to-mouth contact and mouthing objects."
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        "We were really shocked to find what was in the mattresses," co-author Miriam Diamond of the University of Toronto tells the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, which notes one mattress's weight was 3% flame retardant. Phthalates and flame retardants are types chemicals whose compounds have been linked to everything from cancer and hormonal disruption to lower IQs. Phthalates are generally used as plasticizers to facilitate bending and get added to plastic mattress covers, but Diamond said researchers were surprised to find them in non-plastic covers as well.

                                        As for what concerned parents can do, the chief scientific officer at the Food Packaging Forum explains her choices to CNN: "We opted for large brands that I knew had at least some chemicals policies, and tried to get natural materials—latex, cotton, merino—or buy second hand, because I figured that most chemicals that would gas out will already have gassed out."

          &lt;p&gt;No matter how bad things might seem, at least you haven't accidentally eaten fox poop and developed an insidious tapeworm infection that masquerades as a cancerous liver tumor while it slowly destroys your organs and eventually kills you—or, you &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; haven't done that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, according to &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/5/24-1608_article#suggestedcitation"&gt;a newly published study in Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;, even if you have somehow feasted on fox feces and acquired this nightmare parasite, it's looking less likely that doctors will need to hack out chunks of your organs to try to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the good news from the new study. The bad news is that, while this infection is fairly rare, it appears to be increasing. And, if you do get it, you might have a shorter lifespan than the uninfected and may be sicker in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meet the fox tapeworm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study is a retrospective one, in which a group of doctors in Switzerland examined medical records of 334 patients who developed the disease alveolar echinococcosis (AE) over a 50-year span (1973–2022). AE is an understudied, life-threatening infection caused by the fox tapeworm, &lt;em&gt;Echinococcus multilocularis&lt;/em&gt;. The parasite is not common, but can be found throughout the Northern Hemisphere, particularly regions of China and Russia, and countries in continental Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/echinococcosis/index.html"&gt;In the parasite's intended lifecycle&lt;/a&gt;, adult intestinal worms release eggs into the feces of their primary host—foxes, or sometimes coyotes, dogs, or other canids. The eggs then get ingested by an intermediate host, such as voles. There, eggs develop into a spherical embryo with six hooks that pierce through the intestinal wall to migrate to the animal's organs, primarily the liver. Once nestled into an organ, the parasites develop into multi-chambered, thin-walled cysts—a proliferative life stage that lasts indefinitely. As more cysts develop, the mass&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/echinococcosis/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt; looks and acts like cancer&lt;/a&gt;, forming necrotic cavities and sometimes metastasizing to other organs, such as the lungs and brain. The parasite remains in these cancerous-like masses, waiting for a fox to eat the cyst-riddled organs of its host. Back in a fox, the worms attach to the intestines and grow into adults.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Parents on Wednesday were notified of a whooping cough case at a Wake County school.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to the Wake County Public School System, Leesville Road High School sent a letter to parents stating the county had confirmed a case of pertussis, known as whooping cough, among one of its students.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Whooping cough is a respiratory infection caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. It is characterized by intense coughing fits that can end with a “whooping” sound when someone exhales.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms can include a runny nose, low fever, coughing that gets worse over time an apnea.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/whooping-cough-wake-county-school-march-2025/"&gt;the county detected whooping cough in a student at Oberlin Middle School&lt;/a&gt;. The Department of Health and Human Services said there were 106 cases of whooping cough in the first three months of 2025, which they say is a 106% increase from the same time period in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state added that they are seeing whooping cough infections across all age groups, with the highest frequency among school-aged children and the highest rate among infants. While anyone can catch whooping cough, it can be dangerous among babies and children.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state also said only 49% of the cases have been up to date on their vaccinations, which doctors is the best but not perfect way to prevent whooping cough infections.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Doctors also say it’s best to treat whooping cough with antibiotics as soon as possible so it won’t become more serious and prevent the spread of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The CDC provided the following suggestions for managing the illness at home while you’re child is recovering:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take antibiotics exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your home free from things that cause coughing like:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dust.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chemical fumes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use a clean, cool mist humidifier to loosen mucus and soothe the cough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat small meals every few hours to help prevent vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get plenty of fluids, including water, juices, and fruits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/drive.google.com/file/d/1kA-EBWKlOQ1RuARHzUiXyNrXnWI7up3Q/view?usp=drive_link__;!!M5erwxGTI6mlTHJSECWB8LY!HtDs-QvGX-K_0ZOJz1GnBjXBZ-k1VsOcHxBxnQu0jYLJOIs1Xj--BQmu5RaCtU3RzXsNkuWqMMY$"&gt;Wake County Health Services also sent a letter to families&lt;/a&gt; for any further questions on whooping cough. In the letter Leesville Road High School sent to parents, the school said it is taking every measure to ensure the health and safety of its students.&lt;/p&gt;

            People who had metabolic syndrome, or a combination of those components, were 24% more likely to develop dementia at a young age, the data showed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000a3b6ouxlz9kty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The key takeaway (of the study) is that metabolic syndrome significantly increases the risk of developing young-onset dementia,” which is dementia before age 65, said principal study investigator Dr. Minwoo Lee, in an email. “Our findings highlight the importance of managing metabolic health early to potentially prevent dementia and maintain brain health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000b3b6o8pssphcw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study analyzed data of nearly 2 million people from the Korean National Health Insurance Service who underwent health checkups. Researchers analyzed the markers of metabolic syndrome and who developed young-onset dementia between 2009 and the end of 2020, according to the study published Wednesday in &lt;a href="https://press.aan.com/e3t/Ctc/UE+113/d5xxPS04/VWhNl35WRnpcW4DJn9n3rHR9vW6phD5r5vvpw0N6B8NrC5kvg0W8wM7ks6lZ3p5W1gM7Z994z87_W6TT11R2yX22XVhrQlN3px4zdW61Yr8N829MVJW3Nsqd962kw_KN4QGx59Cc91GN5YHPwS8cSd0N5xGy1lF99wfN6nqn-43KmQzW8hcP3x5PD95zW2_jZPb2Vl6VPW4zD0NT8-LRT1W3cmPpl3hYvPjW5w6J1w8SfpzDW1C2zl588C85-W9dGl1F63jDN9VH1pQV8dL4YXW16ZylQ6662FnW5RcShV8Lv68lW7C9D4n3bN-6XW6kNJlX3yk03xW2HVgXm45cPVcW5C0Z869bVlHqW1SB-Qw1V8ZKwW4PvCgw1CJH9fW8-RXGb5pdgvBV6d6Rc4xRxHYW3Ktt5s49bXqyW7vd4NL86Rt1JW372VcR5B2TdLW648FwF1b7YvlW369nvn5F873XW3vKBP897QkCtW10JJf23-zJ8MVyGnYR6J8WNxW7dN4qn31g69KVCG4T-6kRBdCW4Df9Rs1my97LW4TQ2_b5YVBMqVzcnJx7HlccXW5BWSCT2xLQCpN8MSsgtvJR9bW29s1C05tB2j2W39YBn711tZ4lf8dQjxj04" target="_blank"&gt;the journal Neurology&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000c3b6oba3uwef5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Each component — such as elevated blood pressure, high blood sugar, obesity, abnormal cholesterol levels — is individually linked to higher dementia risk,” said Lee, assistant professor in the department of neurology at Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital in South Korea.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000d3b6o3j3rb4oo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The finding suggests an increased risk for much of the US population, as about 1 in 3 adults in the United States have metabolic syndrome, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000e3b6o2adgmwz6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Dementia is among our most feared diseases, and developing dementia at an early age is even more worrisome,” said Dr. Richard Isaacson, a preventive neurologist and director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida. He was not involved in the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000f3b6o89m1pek5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People of all ages –– from the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and beyond –– should be empowered to make brain-healthy choices early on,” Isaacson said.  “I think this study gives us more evidence to suggest that these brain-healthy choices may lead to better brain outcomes over time.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000g3b6op8h4f7mf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is important to note that the study was observational, which means that researchers can’t say that metabolic syndrome caused dementia, only that there was a correlation between the two, Isaacson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000h3b6om5fgxv3s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t really think that vascular risk factors and metabolic syndrome causes Alzheimer’s disease, but I think it can fast-forward someone towards it,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000i3b6ooqlvtqcy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More research will need to be done to determine whether treating metabolic syndrome actually delays the onset of dementia or reduces the number of cases, Isaacson said. Researchers will also need to look into more populations to see if the results from South Korea can be broadly applied.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000j3b6ojhdjzv3g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the latest study does give hope that there are actions people can take to combat young-onset dementia, he said. “Some people say young onset-dementia, you can’t do anything about that –– it’s preordained, but I don’t agree with that. These lifestyle factors are nontrivial,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000k3b6oonz53eyd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lee believes people can influence their odds. “My advice is to proactively manage metabolic health by maintaining a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and routine medical check-ups,” he said. “Addressing metabolic syndrome early can substantially reduce the risk of dementia later in life.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm9u3xyek00103b6o6ldc1zvu@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="the-connection-between-vascular-and-brain-health" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        The connection between vascular and brain health
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000l3b6o0kkzur7e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The conditions that make up metabolic syndrome may not seem immediately connected to dementia risk, but there are a few ways that vascular health can impact cognitive decline, Isaacson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000m3b6o77yqfqzy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Metabolic syndrome can lead to inflammation, and “when someone has inflammation in the body and in the brain, it can fast-forward aging,” Isaacson said. “And when you have inflammation in the brain, things don’t work as well.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000n3b6ope1tcmfe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Your blood vessels working efficiently is also important to cognitive health to keep enough oxygen flowing to the brain, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000o3b6o7ybj8blq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And finally, he noted that metabolic syndrome may affect the brain’s ability to metabolize energy, which may lead to cognitive impairment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000p3b6oe9gg88vm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The different conditions that make up metabolic syndrome tend to happen together because they have similar causes and impact one another, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000q3b6otxfhm991@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When a person is physically inactive and has an unhealthy diet … and someone is not sleeping and just kind of burning the candle at both ends … poor activity, low exercise: These are the medical or clinical manifestations of that sort of thing,” Isaacson said. “That’s why these risk factors often flock together — because they really are interrelated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000r3b6oub6ls64m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because both genetic and lifestyle factors contribute&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to dementia cases, some people can do everything their doctor suggests and still get dementia, Isaacson said. But making healthy lifestyle changes and addressing metabolic syndrome may still prevent or delay dementia in many people, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000s3b6od03oyjqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Treatment for metabolic syndrome, which can also increase the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, starts with lifestyle changes, said Dr. Pam Taub, a preventive cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of California San Diego. She was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000t3b6odvvmam5u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In general, the lifestyle recommendations that we recommend are really having a balanced &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/01/health/mediterranean-diet-recipes-wellness/index.html"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, a diet that is balanced in terms of proteins, carbohydrates, and fiber, and also limiting the amount of calorie intake,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000u3b6obfdxbagx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some of Taub’s research into metabolic syndrome shows that time-restricted eating can help manage the conditions, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000v3b6o7ixesjvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maintaining regular physical activity is key, though the amount and the proportion of strength, cardio and flexibility training may be specific to you and discussed with your doctor, she said. Getting enough sleep and handling stress are also essential in managing almost every chronic condition, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000w3b6of0lzz2ro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Of course, we can’t control the stress that’s thrown at us, but it’s how we modulate our response that is important,” Taub said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000x3b6o2oy79lx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But lifestyle changes alone may not solve the problem completely, she said. Your doctor may recommend medications to help with blood pressure, blood sugar, insulin resistance, lipid lowering and weight management.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000y3b6o5cf0pr8b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really not one or the other,” Taub said. “You have to synergize both lifestyle and pharmacology.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

By combining brain imaging with clinical data, researchers developed machine learning models that accurately predicted treatment outcomes across two large trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding brain-based biomarkers significantly improved prediction accuracy over traditional factors like age or symptom severity. This marks a major step toward personalized, faster, and more effective treatment for depression—reducing the frustration of trial-and-error prescribing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain-Based Prediction:&lt;/strong&gt; Connectivity in a key brain region improves antidepressant outcome forecasts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Trial Success:&lt;/strong&gt; Models trained in one study accurately predicted outcomes in another.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward Personalization:&lt;/strong&gt; The findings pave the way for tailored depression treatments based on brain scans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;CAMH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding the right antidepressant treatment can be a frustrating, time-consuming process — one that often requires individuals to endure weeks of ineffective medication before trying something new. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study offers hope for a more personalized approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109053"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They found that adding a brain connectivity marker to traditional clinical data (such as age, sex and baseline depression severity) significantly improved prediction performance across both studies. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, the study reveals promising progress toward predicting how patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) will respond to antidepressant medications using brain imaging and clinical data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research demonstrated that brain connectivity patterns — specifically in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex — could significantly improve predictions of treatment response across two large, independent clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In spite of the availability of several antidepressant treatments, including medications and psychotherapy, many individuals with depression have difficulties finding the treatment that works best for them,” said Diego Pizzagalli, PhD, director of the Noel Drury, M.D. Institute for Translational Depression Discoveries at UC Irvine and Distinguished Professor at the Charlie Dunlop School of Biological Sciences and the School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a result, for many, treatment follows a trial-and-error approach. Discovering brain-based markers predicting positive antidepressant response promises to allow a more personalized treatment and thereby speed up reduction of symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using machine learning models trained on clinical and neuroimaging data from more than 350 participants in two international trials — EMBARC in the U.S. and CANBIND-1 in Canada — the researchers evaluated whether their algorithms could reliably predict who would respond to common antidepressants like sertraline and escitalopram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that adding a brain connectivity marker to traditional clinical data (such as age, sex and baseline depression severity) significantly improved prediction performance across both studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We identified a brain connectivity marker that was predictive of response to common antidepressants across two large-scale clinical trials in the U.S. and Canada,” explained Peter Zhukovsky, a former postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Pizzagalli’s laboratory and now Scientist in the Brain Health Imaging Centre at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The predictive performance of our algorithm was improved by the addition of the brain connectivity feature to clinical and demographic markers, reaching moderate levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings are promising for the search for biomarkers predicting depression response. We hope these efforts will help connect patients with treatments that are most likely to work for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also tackled the often-overlooked challenge of generalizability — whether a prediction model developed in one trial will hold up in a completely separate population. That’s where this research stands out. Models trained on one trial performed surprisingly well when tested on another, highlighting the potential for broader real-world use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Data harmonization and building a large-scale database with different treatments is challenging,” noted Zhukovsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, we’re hopeful that cross-trial analyses such as the one we conducted in this project will advance precision medicine goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s implications are far-reaching. By developing biomarkers that are not limited to one treatment setting or population, researchers are laying the groundwork for clinical tools that could eventually match patients with effective treatments earlier, potentially reducing suffering and speeding recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We investigated biomarkers predicting antidepressant treatment response,” Zhukovsky added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, many other options are available for treating depression and if we can identify markers for specific treatments, then the resulting decision support tools could be tested in biomarker-guided clinical studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mental health disorders continue to rise globally, the need for faster, data-driven treatment approaches is more urgent than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s findings underscore the promise of brain-based diagnostics to transform how depression is treated. But they also stress that more research is needed — larger trials, new treatment comparisons and real-world implementation studies — to bring these insights from the lab to the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This line of work will be one of the key priorities within the recently launched Noel Drury, M.D. Institute for Translational Depression Discoveries at UC Irvine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was made possible through a multi-institutional collaboration among researchers from McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School; the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; the New York State Psychiatric Institute; Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons; Stony Brook University; the University of Toronto; and the Centre for Depression and Suicide Studies at Unity Health Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EMBARC study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health (U01MH092221 and U01MH092250).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CAN-BIND-1 trial was conducted in partnership with, and received financial support from, the Ontario Brain Institute and the Brain-CODE platform, with partial funding from the government of Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and psychopharmacology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9be1faf8b5f8faf7ffecfef7f7dbf8faf6f3b5f8fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zachary Caldwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://camh.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CAMH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Zachary Caldwell – CAMH&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.1310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Generalizability of Treatment Outcome Prediction Across Antidepressant Treatment Trials in Depression&lt;/a&gt;” by Diego Pizzagalli et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generalizability of Treatment Outcome Prediction Across Antidepressant Treatment Trials in Depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although several predictive models for response to antidepressant treatment have emerged on the basis of individual clinical trials, it is unclear whether such models generalize to different clinical and geographical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess whether neuroimaging and clinical features predict response to sertraline and escitalopram in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) across 2 multisite studies using machine learning and to predict change in depression severity in 2 independent studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This prognostic study included structural and functional resting-state magnetic resonance imaging and clinical and demographic data from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) randomized clinical trial (RCT), which administered sertraline (in stage 1 and stage 2) and placebo, and the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CANBIND-1) RCT, which administered escitalopram. EMBARC recruited participants with MDD (aged 18-65 years) at 4 academic sites across the US between August 2011 and December 2015. CANBIND-1 recruited participants with MDD from 6 outpatient centers across Canada between August 2013 and December 2016. Data were analyzed from October 2023 to May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prediction performance for treatment response was assessed using balanced classification accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). In secondary analyses, prediction performance was assessed using observed vs predicted correlations between change in depression severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 363 adult patients (225 from EMBARC and 138 from CANBIND-1; mean [SD] age, 36.6 [13.1] years; 235 women [64.7%]), the best-performing models using pretreatment clinical features and functional connectivity of the dorsal anterior cingulate had moderate cross-trial generalizability for antidepressant treatment (trained on CANBIND-1 and tested on EMBARC, AUC = 0.62 for stage 1 and AUC = 0.67 for stage 2; trained on EMBARC stage 1 and tested on CANBIND-1, AUC = 0.66). The addition of neuroimaging features improved the prediction performance of antidepressant response compared with clinical features only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of early-treatment (week 2) instead of pretreatment depression severity scores resulted in the best generalization performance, comparable to within-trial performance. Multivariate regressions showed substantial cross-trial generalizability in change in depression severity (predicted vs observed &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; ranging from 0.31 to 0.39).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this prognostic study of depression outcomes, models predicting response to antidepressants show substantial generalizability across different RCTs of adult MDD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 19:38:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFByVzd3UG1QYkY0TGE1ejBHVllGTEJBaUpTX2JrbThsTGp3Q0tjM3UxUmNuUFZqcEpBT3hHMzhJd1pBcGQxUmlNd3UwdjI1OGk0Z3gtdThmbUxnRmpJb25rTFdvdmhZT2tqOVJBQlZn</guid></item><item><title>寄生虫会增加宫颈癌的风险，研究发现- Live Science | Parasitic worm raises risk of cervical cancer, study finds - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxPZ0dMaldIenM2eUQtc0tENEZqNUxITWV5azl6RmkzR1VpWUJfclh3WU53SzRES1FHQnFJZDQ5V2dXWG5Ub1JWREp6Vk9fVzZEamhYajBpbE5sREUtaGk1aG0xSjVsZFNXRHJBampBc3NLOTdVdUYyLVVwLXJlcDNncjYzUzZTOTliOS0yM2NMWmFJNDl5bEFRelNRQU52OEtt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;

To investigate how the worm might affect the cervix, researchers analyzed tissue samples from 39 women in Tanzania — 20 with active infections and 19 without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the infected participants received the standard treatment, a drug called praziquantel. Tissue samples were collected before this treatment and then again four to 12 months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed the tissues' gene activity, pinpointing several genes that behaved differently in infected women than in uninfected women; they also identified genes that changed their activity after the antiparasitic treatment. Four of the altered genes are known to play roles in cancer, typically by driving abnormal cell growth and tumors when their activity is turned up too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After treatment, genes involved in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and tissue repair, along with genes associated with the breakdown of the cervix's protective barriers, became more active. These changes were tied to more blood-vessel growth and less cell death, as well as to the activation of some processes seen in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in the genes that help maintain the cervix's protective barrier are "especially concerning," lead study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://globalhealth.weill.cornell.edu/fellowship/global-health-fellows" target="_blank" data-url="https://globalhealth.weill.cornell.edu/fellowship/global-health-fellows" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Anna Mertelsmann&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at University Hospital Zurich and Weill Cornell Medicine who specializes in infectious diseases and molecular oncology, said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1079324" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1079324" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "Without these, women may become more vulnerable to HPV infection and persistence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, these changes in the cervix could open the door to cancer-causing viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-the-worm-raises-cervical-cancer-risk-3"&gt;How the worm raises cervical cancer risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, when the parasite's eggs become lodged in cervical tissue, they provoke a strong inflammatory response, Mertelsmann told Live Science in an email. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-oxidative-stress" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-oxidative-stress"&gt;&lt;u&gt;This inflammation produces reactive molecules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that could damage DNA in cells in the surface of the cervix, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same mechanism is believed to lead to bladder cancer, which can occur when &lt;em&gt;S. haematobium &lt;/em&gt;eggs enter the bladder, Downs said. An estimated 40% to 70% of women and girls infected with the parasite likely have eggs lodged in the genital tract, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the carcinogenic effects of the eggs, the infection triggers repeated cycles of injury and healing that can lead to abnormal tissue growth, Mertelsmann said in an email. Simultaneously, changes in the cervix's protective barrier may impair the body's ability to detect and eliminate precancerous cells before they progress to cancer, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that praziquantel may carry risks for cancer, as it was associated with genetic changes linked to the disease. "At least shortly after treatment, the elimination of the &lt;em&gt;S. haematobium&lt;/em&gt; might at least transiently increase the risk for oncogenesis," or cancer growth, Mertelsmann told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, while the data point to these cancer-related genetic changes, "we don't know if &lt;em&gt;S. haematobium&lt;/em&gt; infection or the treatment causes or contributes to cervical cancer," she emphasized. Longer, larger studies are needed to unpack exactly how the genetic changes might impact cancer risk, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, if left untreated, &lt;em&gt;S. haematobium&lt;/em&gt; infection &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/schistosomiasis/symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/schistosomiasis/symptoms/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;can damage organs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including the lungs, intestines and spleen, so forgoing treatment would come with its own risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insights from this study could have significant implications for cancer prevention in regions where schistosomiasis is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-an-endemic-disease" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-an-endemic-disease"&gt;&lt;u&gt;endemic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Women diagnosed with &lt;em&gt;S. haematobium &lt;/em&gt;should be closely monitored for early signs of cervical tissue abnormalities," Mertelsmann said in the statement. Additional therapies, such as anti-inflammatory or immune-modulating drugs, may also help to counteract the harmful effects seen after treatment, she suggested. "Moreover, widespread HPV vaccination could play a crucial role in reducing cervical cancer risk for women affected by schistosomiasis," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the researchers are following a larger group of 180 women over a year to confirm these early results. Future studies will explore whether women with a history of schistosomiasis are more likely to develop cervical cancer due to long-term HPV infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-bQKnrmL75b7ET6oUSoWbM4-rQ0gjvUzuoFzg2PlRgqkBjzKgzqkbT5q" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-bQKnrmL75b7ET6oUSoWbM4-rQ0gjvUzuoFzg2PlRgqkBjzKgzqkbT5q slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;According to an April 23 &lt;a href="https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Public-Health-Environment/News/2025/Second-2025-Measles-Case" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment (DDPHE), a second 2025 case of measles has been confirmed in the Mile High City, this case involving an adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The press release described measles as a "highly contagious" disease, with cases often severe but preventable. The most effective way of preventing measles is through vaccination, which the majority of Americans receive – about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/measles.htm" target="_blank"&gt;91 percent of children born in 2016 were vaccinated by age two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.denver7.com/news/front-range/denver/denvers-second-measles-case-of-the-year-found-in-adult-relative-of-unvaccinated-infant" target="_blank"&gt;Denver7&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent Denver case involves a relative of an infant who was taken to Mexico while still too young to be vaccinated, bringing measles back to Colorado upon their return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as how contagious measles is, CPR reports that up to &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/04/01/colorado-below-herd-immunity-for-measles/" target="_blank"&gt;nine of every ten people&lt;/a&gt; exposed to the virus behind the disease without vaccination can be infected. Meanwhile, DDPHE reports that two doses of the MMR vaccine offer long-last protection that's &lt;a href="https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Public-Health-Environment/News/2025/Second-2025-Measles-Case" target="_blank"&gt;97 percent effective&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DDPHE press release on the matter encouraged vaccination, but also noted that there is no risk of measles to the general public regarding this new case, given that most of the public has been vaccinated for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles primarily affects the respiratory system, resulting in symptoms of fever, a cough, and a runny nose, often followed by the red rash that the disease is known for. While many people recover, it can lead to death. CPR &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/04/01/colorado-below-herd-immunity-for-measles/" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that an estimated 48,000 people were hospitalized with measles and 400 to 500 people died each year prior to when the vaccine was introduced. To help put those numbers into perspective, as of April 17 of this year, a total of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;800 cases had been confirmed&lt;/a&gt; in 2025 nationwide. Between 2020 and 2024, a single case of measles was confirmed in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High blood pressure, or hypertension, occurs when your blood presses relentlessly against your artery walls. As this pressure rises, your heart is forced to work harder than usual to pump blood through your body. Over time, this extra workload can damage blood vessels and heighten the risk of serious complications like heart attack and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Half of adults in the U.S. live with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906963/sneaky-reasons-blood-pressure-is-high-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yet, it often goes unnoticed in the early stages, earning it the nickname “the silent killer.” While managing high blood pressure typically includes lifestyle changes and medication, many people turn to supplements for additional support. Although many of these pills and powders contain naturally derived ingredients, not all are as heart-friendly and innocent as they may seem. To help protect your ticker, we reached out to a cardiologist and a cardiovascular dietitian to find out which supplements you should avoid if you have high blood pressure.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bitter orange extract, derived from the dried peel of the bitter orange fruit, is often used in supplements marketed for weight loss and athletic performance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, for people with high blood pressure, this extract can pose a serious risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This herb contains synephrine, which can raise blood pressure and trigger dangerous heart rhythms,” says&lt;a href="https://myhhn.org/meet-our-founders/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Columbus Batiste, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., a board-certified interventional cardiologist and co-founder of Healthy Heart Nation. For instance, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that prolonged bitter orange use may raise systolic blood pressure (the top reading) by 6 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (the bottom reading) by 4 mmHg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This supplement may also raise the likelihood of serious complications like heart attack and stroke. Like many of the supplements on this list, bitter orange is frequently combined with other ingredients. So, label reading is critical.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Known for its distinctively sweet flavor and soothing properties, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7877890/health-benefits-of-licorice-root/#:~:text=If%20you%20decide%20to%20give,can%20lead%20to%20serious%20complications." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;licorice root&lt;/a&gt; has traditionally been used as an herbal remedy to ease digestive issues, fight viruses and soothe sore throats.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, “if you have high blood pressure, it’s best to avoid licorice supplements or products containing licorice as a secondary ingredient,” says &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiovascular dietitian and owner of Entirely Nourished. This is because licorice contains glycyrrhizic acid, a compound that can cause the body to retain sodium, potentially increasing blood pressure. One study found that even low doses of licorice root containing as little as 100 milligrams of glycyrrhizic acid may significantly raise blood pressure when consumed regularly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, licorice root has been shown to decrease potassium levels. That can lead to muscle weakness and irregular heart rhythms, putting further strain on the heart.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While some licorice root supplements claim to be free of glycyrrhizic acid, keep in mind that supplements aren’t regulated in the same way as foods. That means you may not always be getting what the label says. For instance, the above study found that the glycyrrhizic acid content of the supplement tested was actually 50% higher than the amount listed on the supplement label.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-caffeine-containing-supplements"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Caffeine-Containing Supplements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Caffeine isn’t just in your morning coffee or afternoon tea. It’s also a common ingredient in many supplements that claim to boost energy, improve alertness and enhance physical performance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, this popular stimulant can cause a temporary spike in blood pressure, making it a risky choice for those with hypertension, says Routhenstein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For instance, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that caffeine supplements raised systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2 mmHg. While this slight increase in blood pressure might seem harmless, even a small bump of around 2 mmHg can impact heart health in high-risk individuals. If you’re wondering how much is safe, we all metabolize caffeine differently, so the answer is different for everyone. Even small amounts of caffeine may spike blood pressure in some people. And the more you consume, the more those numbers climb. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to looking for caffeine on your supplement’s label, you’ll also want to keep an eye out for guarana. This caffeine-rich ingredient, often found in energy supplements and drinks, also raises heart rate and blood pressure, says Batiste.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-yohimbine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Yohimbine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yohimbine, a compound found in the bark of the yohimbe tree, is frequently found in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/herbal-teas-to-avoid-high-blood-pressure-8691951" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supplements and teas &lt;/a&gt;marketed for weight loss, athletic performance, improved sexual health and—ironically—high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Not so fast, says Batiste. “Yohimbine is a stimulant that can dangerously raise blood pressure and heart rate,” he warns. Routhenstein agrees, explaining that it increases blood pressure by raising the levels of a hormone and messenger called norepinephrine. And as norepinephrine levels rise, blood vessels begin to narrow, impairing blood flow and leading to higher blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-ephedra"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Ephedra &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ephedra is an herbal dietary supplement that has been used for centuries as a natural remedy for colds, headaches, coughs and fever, particularly in China and India. Fast-forward to the 21st century when it became a sought-after ingredient in dietary supplements promoted for weight loss, physical performance and enhanced energy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it is far from risk-free. “This herb contains ephedrine alkaloids, strong stimulant compounds linked to high blood pressure, heart attacks, strokes and even sudden death,” says Batiste. “It can also interfere with blood pressure and heart medications, making them less effective.” Due to these serious side effects, ephedra has been banned by the Food and Drug Administration for use in supplements. Although it’s banned in dietary supplements, its active ingredient, ephedrine, can be found in some allergy and asthma medications&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Therefore, you should always consult your health care provider before taking anything with ephedra listed in the ingredients.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keeping your blood pressure in check isn’t just about avoiding certain supplements. A healthy lifestyle can have a significant impact on your numbers. For instance, avoiding cigarettes and limiting alcohol are proven ways to reduce your risk of hypertension. These expert-approved tips can also help:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow the DASH Diet: &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289964/7-day-dash-diet-menu/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; (short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) has a long, solid track record for lowering blood pressure. It emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, fish, lean meats and low-fat dairy products, yet is low in trans and saturated fats and added sugars.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Regularly: &lt;/strong&gt;For better blood pressure, the American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity each week. They also suggest muscle-strengthening exercises like weight lifting at least two days per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, sleep impacts your blood pressure, too! Strive for seven to nine hours of restful sleep each night. If you snort, snore or momentarily stop breathing during the night, you may have &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7908018/sleep-apnea-can-make-heart-disease-worse-a-new-study-proves/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;, a hidden cause of high blood pressure. If that sounds familiar, speak with your doctor, who can help you find effective treatment..&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Stress: &lt;/strong&gt;Everyone is stressed out sometimes. But when stress becomes the norm, it can raise your blood pressure. Meditation, deep breathing, practicing gratitude, adopting hobbies you enjoy and connecting with friends and loved ones can all help restore calm in your life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Store shelves are filled with supplements claiming to improve your health. While some supplements may offer certain health benefits, others can raise blood pressure or negatively interact with blood pressure-lowering medications. Cardiologists and dietitians agree there are specific supplements you shouldn’t take if you have high blood pressure, especially bitter orange, licorice root, caffeine, yohimbine and ephedra. Because supplements can contain multiple ingredients, it’s especially important to take the time to read the ingredient list. If you’re considering taking these or any other supplements, talk to your health care provider to make sure that they’re safe and effective for your unique health needs.&lt;br&gt;

You typically don't see those things unless there is a major acute event that has occurred.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Usually, the worst of the immediate effects are in somebody with an illness like asthma or emphysema (where tiny air sacs in the lungs are damaged or destroyed),' Dr Gupta continued.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Heavily polluted air could cause an exacerbation like chest pain, short breathing, and may require these people to go to the hospital,' the pulmonologist added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One person revealed on X that they had received &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/J5182J/status/1915111352328147270"&gt;an air quality alert message&lt;/a&gt; on their phone, warning that 'everyone is even more likely to experience serious health effects.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another person on X shared a message from their son, showing that Chicago's air was inundated with both carbon monoxide and PM10 - meaning particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both are toxic to humans, but they harm the body in different ways and vary in their toxicity depending on exposure levels and duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The readings, taken at 2pm ET, showed that Chicago was seeing carbon monoxide levels of 318 ppb (parts per billion) in their air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While that level is relatively low in terms of outdoor air quality, the amount of fine particulate matter in the air set off alarm bells on Google Maps' air quality tracking system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chicago's reported PM10 concentration of 669 µg/m³ (micrograms per cubic meter) is extremely bad and fell into the 'Hazardous' category of the Air Quality Index, indicating serious health risks for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, many on Reddit argued that both AccuWeather and IQAir had listed the city's air quality as either 'fair' or 'good.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conversely, air quality readings produced by Apple were also registering a major problem in the Chicago area on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Social media users on X shared disturbing images of what appeared to be an air quality emergency in Chicago Wednesday afternoon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Levels of fine particulate matter reportedly reached extremely hazardous levels and set off air quality alerts on mobile phones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Why is my iPhone weather app telling me that Chicago’s air quality is hazardous right now but other websites say otherwise?' an X user asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some commenters suspected that the extreme air quality emergency may have been nothing more than a glitch in software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;IQAir reported that there were only a handful of small fires being reported on in the area Wednesday, but nothing large enough to cause an environmental emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tragically, one firefighter did die while battling a blaze on Chicago's west side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chicago is known for poor air quality.

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;rare sixth-century sword&lt;/strong&gt; has been uncovered in an Anglo-Saxon burial site near Canterbury, England. This remarkable find offers new insights into early medieval life and could reshape our understanding of Anglo-Saxon society and weaponry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The discovery, widely covered in media like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/dec/26/really-incredible-sixth-century-sword-found-in-kent" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is comparable to the famous Sutton Hoo sword and has been detailed in a report by the University of Central Lancashire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ancient Weaponry in Perfect Condition&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sword, which was found in excellent condition, boasts a &lt;strong&gt;silver-and-gilt hilt &lt;/strong&gt;adorned with &lt;strong&gt;intricate decorative patterns&lt;/strong&gt;, making it an exceptional example of high-status weaponry from the early medieval period. Its blade bears an embossed runic script. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, parts of the sword’s scabbard—crafted from leather and wood and lined with beaver fur—have remarkably survived centuries of wear and decay. Duncan Sayer, the lead archaeologist on the project, emphasized the uniqueness of the sword, stating that it “rivals the swords from Dover and Sutton Hoo.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alice Roberts, professor and presenter of &lt;em&gt;Digging for Britain,&lt;/em&gt; also noted the discovery’s importance, calling it “&lt;strong&gt;an astonishing sword&lt;/strong&gt;” amid an extraordinary Anglo-Saxon cemetery filled with weaponry and &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/11/archaeologists-unearth-1874-message-in-a-bottle-from-a-viking-grave-a-150-year-old-secret-revealed/"&gt;finely furnished graves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Anglo-Saxon Cemetery: An Unprecedented Find&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discovery was made in a previously unexplored Anglo-Saxon cemetery located in Kent, a region rich with historical significance. Archaeologists have so far excavated twelve graves, with estimates suggesting that&lt;strong&gt; around 200 more remain buried at the site&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These graves date back to the fifth and sixth centuries, a period in Anglo-Saxon history that remains largely enigmatic due to the limited written records from the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&lt;strong&gt; cemetery&lt;/strong&gt; has yielded numerous other artifacts, including iron spear-points, &lt;strong&gt;seaxes (Anglo-Saxon knives)&lt;/strong&gt;, and an array of decorative items, all of which offer a wealth of information about the burial practices and material culture of the Anglo-Saxons. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe that the cemetery is the final resting place of individuals who were part of the elite class. The &lt;strong&gt;exact location of the cemetery&lt;/strong&gt; has been kept secret, as excavations are ongoing. Duncan Sayer explained that revealing the site’s location could jeopardize further research and preservation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Sword’s Symbolism: A Royal Connection?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the fascinating features of the sword is the presence of a ring attached to its pommel, which archaeologists believe might symbolize an oath or a bond with a high-status figure, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/3000-year-old-secret-tutankhamun-tomb/" data-type="post" data-id="83600"&gt;possibly a king.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This detail opens a window into the social and political structures of the Anglo-Saxon elite. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The presence of such symbols and the&lt;strong&gt; sword’s high craftsmanship&lt;/strong&gt; suggest that the individual buried with this weapon was a person of considerable importance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Window Into Anglo-Saxon Life&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Historians and archaeologists alike have long struggled with the lack of written records from this period, often referred to as the “&lt;strong&gt;Dark Ages&lt;/strong&gt;.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the ongoing excavation at this site, combined with the sword’s survival. Once fully researched and conserved, the sword will be displayed at the &lt;a href="https://kentdowns.org.uk/activities/folkestone-museum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Folkestone Museum in Kent&lt;/a&gt;, where visitors will have the opportunity to witness a tangible connection to this fascinating period of history.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“ Now it’s absolutely definite that there has to have been a &lt;strong&gt;very significant influx&lt;/strong&gt;, especially in the east coast taking place over generations. They’re not coming from one place, but multiple places. This cemetery is right at the cutting-edge of that work,” explained Sayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

Researchers found that when 15-month-olds heard a new word in a familiar context—like “kumquat” during a conversation about fruit—they later identified the unseen object correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ability to form a mental “gist” of meaning without direct visual cues marks an early milestone in abstract learning and language development. The findings highlight that babies are not just passive listeners—they actively construct knowledge from the language they hear, even about things they can’t see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Word Inference:&lt;/strong&gt; 15-month-old infants can infer meanings of unseen words using context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Representation:&lt;/strong&gt; Infants form a “gist” of new words, even without visual cues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developmental Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; The study reveals how language fuels abstract learning in infancy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human language allows us to learn new words for things we’ve never witnessed directly. We do this seamlessly, for example, in conversations, using clues from the overall context to infer a new word’s meaning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how early does this ability become available? And what makes it possible to create a new mental representation of an object or event that we cannot see directly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109045"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a baby and fruits." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Although they had never seen any object paired with that novel word, 15-month-olds nevertheless used the context clues to identify which object was most likely the one to which the novel word referred. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study by developmental scientists at Northwestern University and Harvard University offers the first evidence that infants as young as 15 months can identify an object they have learned about from listening to language — even if the object remains hidden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine an infant playing with blocks on the floor while listening to parents talk about kumquats in a conversation about more familiar fruits like apples and bananas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Might the infant form an initial representation, or gist, about what kumquat means — something edible, likely a fruit? Can they then use this initial gist later when the infant first sees a novel fruit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the questions the researchers sought to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people believe that success in word learning requires that the infant ‘map’ a new word to an object that is physically present (e.g., “Look at the kumquat!”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But in the natural course of a day, it is very common for us — and for infants — to hear words when the objects to which they refer to are not available to our immediate perception,” said senior author Sandra Waxman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re asking whether infants, too, can use the conversational contexts in which a word occurs to begin to learn their meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waxman is the Louis W. Menk Professor of Psychology, director of the Infant and Child Development Center and an Institute for Policy Research Fellow at Northwestern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s co-author is Elena Luchkina, formerly a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern, and now a research scientist at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers engaged 134 infants, 67 each at 12 months and 15 months in a three-part task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the researchers presented infants with words they understand, paired with an image of the object to which it referred (e.g., apple, banana, grapes). Next, infants heard a new word while the image of a novel object (e.g., a kumquat) was hidden from their view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, two novel objects appeared (e.g., a kumquat and a whisk) and infants were asked, e.g., “where is the kumquat?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen-month-olds, but not 12-month-olds, looked longer at the novel fruit (e.g. kumquat) than the novel artifact (e.g., whisk).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although they had never seen any object paired with that novel word, 15-month-olds nevertheless used the context clues to identify which object was most likely the one to which the novel word referred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study shows that even babies who are just beginning to say their first words learn from the language they hear, even if the objects or events being discussed are not present,” Waxman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Babies take in what they hear, and even if no object is present, they form a mental representation, or ‘gist’ of the new word’s meaning, one that is strong enough for them to use later when its referent object does appear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waxman suggested that at 12 months, infants may not yet know enough of the familiar words they heard in the context to begin to form a representation or gist of the new word’s meaning (e.g., that it is likely another fruit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gleaning the meaning of kumquat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By introducing infants to novel words in the absence of any visible object, the researchers devised a powerful test of how much infants can learn about the meaning of a novel word based on language input alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides new insight for the developmental origins of the human capacity to learn about things that are not perceptually present. It also begins to address how, and how early, the human mind can create mental representations of objects and events never witnessed directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new work also highlights the power of language in infants’ daily lives. In listening to conversations and in book-reading, infants often hear words that they don’t yet understand, and that they cannot ‘map’ immediately to an object or event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this study show that by 15 months, infants spontaneously use the linguistic context in which a new word occurs to build a gist of its meaning that will support subsequent learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we hear new words, like “kumquat” in conversation when there are no kumquats around, we don’t waste the opportunity to home in its meaning,” Waxman said. “We now know this is also true about tiny babies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this language and learning research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c8bbbcadb8a0a9a6a1ade6a3bda4a3ad88a6a7babca0bfadbbbcadbaa6e6adacbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stephanie Kulke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://northwestern.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Stephanie Kulke – Northwestern University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321775" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;By 15 months, infants begin to learn new words for objects, even those they’ve never seen&lt;/a&gt;” by Sandra Waxman et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By 15 months, infants begin to learn new words for objects, even those they’ve never seen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human language permits us to call to mind representations of objects, events, and ideas that we cannot witness directly, enabling us to learn about the world far beyond our immediate surroundings. When and how does this capacity emerge?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this question, we evaluated infants at 12 and 15 months, asking whether they establish a representation of a novel noun’s meaning in the absence of any visible referents, and use this representation to identify a candidate referent when it later becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During training, infants (67 12-month-olds; 67 15-month-olds) were primed with words and images of objects from a particular semantic neighborhood (e.g., fruits) and were also introduced to a novel noun (e.g., “a modi”), used to name a hidden object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During test, infants heard that noun again, this time with two unfamiliar objects present—one from the primed neighborhood (e.g., a dragon fruit) and the other from an unrelated semantic neighborhood (e.g., an ottoman).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If infants can represent something about the meaning of the novel noun in the absence of a visible referent and then use such a representation when a candidate referent appears, then at test, they should prefer the object from the primed semantic neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 15 months, infants succeeded. In contrast, 12-month-olds did not succeed on this task even after a full week of vocabulary training designed to boost the effect of priming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible then that 12-month-olds’ representations of novel nouns’ meaning are not yet sufficiently rich (if any at all) to guide their choice of referent when one does appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings suggest that the capacity to establish a representation of a novel noun’s meaning in the absence of any visible referent and use this representation later to identify a candidate referent object emerges between 12 and 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 18:55:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9iazVLVkRRQ1JlR3JsamZlSE93eTlqellSbm0zVzY4VUxHRzdKR0ZLSHlsSHVYTjdQSFk0bXZGZEo2M2dJOHBMUVVpazA3d0FnS0F0WXhPdmc5OFFya29TWXpYUmZHX29WNE04UFdxMHRHSUZ5bFA0</guid></item><item><title>研究放大了为什么莱姆病持续存在以及开哪种抗生素的线索- statnews.com | Studies zoom in on clues to why Lyme disease persists and which antibiotic to prescribe - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNSUJudU1mX1FuUlJaZlhGenhNZFlid294a2FjbnVROXR4N2RsQVdvZzdhRDRsRUM3cVZQeEdSZ0tVQzhzUVZ0VThJQkF4eURoaDdudDRPbG54UGViVVdZU3lHWU45c0RCMllWWi1nQnpUQ29SVXREaUxyY1R6Q2FUUzREOUF6bVJ6V19JdmROc3EtUlhUMC00RQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It starts with the ticks. These insects infect people with the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, microbes that are complicated to study, difficult to detect when they cause illness, and challenging to treat so they don’t linger in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding that bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, requires basic research before creating diagnostics or vaccines, slow progress that is frustrating for people affected by the chronic fatigue and brain fog of long-term Lyme disease or the joint pain of Lyme arthritis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s just fundamentally different from basically all other disease-causing agents,” Brandon Jutras, an associate professor in microbiology-immunology in the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University, told STAT. He is the senior author of two new research papers published Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In both studies, the scientists used mouse models to explore unique chemical components that persist in the roughly 15% of people who don’t recover from Lyme infections and go on to develop a syndrome similar to other infection-associated illnesses, including long Covid. &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr2955" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; tracked antigens among the bacterial remnants that travel to the liver, and the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr9091" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;other study&lt;/a&gt; screened more than 500 approved antibiotics to find one that may be safer and more effective at a lower dose than standard-of-care doxycycline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, they may offer better recognition and potentially lead to alternative treatment choices for the nearly 1,200 people in the United States who develop Lyme disease every day. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The first paper studied a mouse model of Lyme disease to trace where part of the bacteria’s cell wall travels. As the bacteria grow, they spit out peptidoglycan, a component of the cell wall that acts like a large molecular bag. These remnants can still cause infection if injected into healthy mice. When it accumulates in the liver and persists for weeks, it can be a continuous source of antigens, which the immune system sees and attacks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In previous research, the authors discovered that people with post-infectious Lyme arthritis also had that bacterial peptidoglycan cell wall floating in the synovial fluid of their inflamed joints. And consistent with other facts about this bacteria, their peptidoglycans are chemically different, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We found that the unusual chemical features of the Borrelia burgdorferi peptidoglycan is what makes it able to persist,” Jutras said. “It looks like the liver is acting as a sink for these unusual pieces of peptidoglycan.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And back to those ticks: The scientists can’t say for certain, but they suspect a sugar carried by ticks may penetrate the cell walls shed by the bacteria in ways that trap them in the liver, keeping the immune system on high alert. Those antigens from the discarded cell walls that remain may trigger post-treatment Lyme disease, which has similarities to long Covid and other infection-associated illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The peptidoglycan fragments appeared in the mouse livers even after less severe Lyme illness, but to a lesser degree. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amy Proal, a microbiologist who is chief scientific officer at the nonprofit PolyBio Research Foundation and scientific director of the Cohen Center for Recovery from Complex Chronic Illness at Mount Sinai, told STAT studies need to go beyond the persistent antigens in the peptidoglycan cell walls and to search for the bacteria themselves. She was not involved in Wednesday’s Science Translation Medicine studies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we find persistent antigen in patients with long Covid, we interpret our findings differently than this team. I think that’s a key thing to consider,” she said. “It is helpful, I guess, to know that peptidoglycan can persist a little bit longer than we thought or something. But to be most comprehensive and fully understand what can happen in people who get Borrelia and get chronic symptoms, there’d have to be some work after this to actually look for Borrelia, including in the tissue of the patients who have symptoms after Lyme disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Proal said it’s possible the antigens are being actively produced by bacteria lingering in hidden reservoirs, as is the case with the SARS-CoV-2 virus in long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response, Jutras said purified peptidoglycan, alone, persists in mice, asserting that this work suggests that Lyme can persist without the bacteria still present, because of the peptidoglycan’s unusual features.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Peptidoglycan can be detected in human patients after oral and/or IV antibiotics. We have previously attempted to detect bacterial DNA from B. burgdorferi in the exact same patient samples tested in manuscript and were unable to do so,” he told STAT in an email. “Now, it is possible that Borrelia is still present in these human patients, but at levels that are undetectable even by quantitative PCR. That said, virtually undetectable levels of B. burgdorferi (DNA), if present, cannot explain the considerable concentrations of peptidoglycan we have measured in these samples.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second paper addressed drawbacks in standard antibiotic treatment for Lyme infections. Doxycycline is the go-to medication, but it can’t be given to children under age 8. Because it is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, it harms helpful members of the human microbiome while killing the bacteria that cause Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientists used a sophisticated screening process tied to Borrelia’s properties to yield piperacillin as the best choice, a member of the penicillin family that could be used at a lower dose and with fewer off-target effects. The study’s rationale was that an approved antibiotic might already be out there, just not yet found for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With respect to pipericillin and the antibiotic therapy, we already know that it’s safe in humans, but what we don’t know is whether it works to treat Lyme disease in humans,” Jutras said. “The obvious next step is a human clinical trial, but those are very expensive and they require federal support.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Piperacillin hasn’t drawn much interest from the private sector because it’s a generic antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think the field is making incredible strides in all facets of treatment, diagnosis, and in prevention. It’s desperately needed, given the rapid and continual expansion and increase in the number of cases and geographically speaking, where those cases are occurring,” he said. “So further supporting the research and the field in general, I think, is paramount and something that is very much in question these days.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second case of Chronic Wasting Disease was detected in a deer in Social Circle, Ga. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Georgia Department of Natural Resources Wildlife Division said Wednesday that the four-year-old male deer was taken in Berrien County approximately 400 yards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://accesswdun.com/article/2025/1/1282712/chronic-wasting-disease-spotted-in-deer-in-georgia-for-first-time"&gt; from the first CWD-positive deer harvest location&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. The first case was confirmed in January from a deer found on a property near the Berrien-Lanier county line in South Georgia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CWD is a neurological disease that is caused by misfolded proteins called prions, according to the DNR. Currently there is no treatment or preventative vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our staff continues to work in collaboration with landowners and hunters in the CWD Management Area to sample for the disease. These collaborative efforts will help us manage CWD and ensure Georgia maintains healthy deer herds,”  DNR Commissioner Walter Rabon said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no known transmission of CWD to humans. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hunters harvesting a deer, elk, or moose from an area where CWD is known to be present have their animal tested for CWD prior to consuming the meat and do not consume the meat if the animal tests positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Mice trained to associate visual cues with cold temperatures began to increase their metabolism when shown those cues—even at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This response was linked to specific memory-encoding neurons, or “engrams,” in the hippocampus that drive thermogenesis via brown fat activation. The findings could have major implications for treating disorders like obesity and cancer, where metabolism and thermoregulation play key roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold Memories Exist:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice formed lasting memories of cold that altered their metabolism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engrams Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Activating or silencing cold-specific hippocampal engrams changed metabolic responses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Insights into cold memory could inform treatments for obesity and cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;TCD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New multidisciplinary research led by Prof. Tomás Ryan from Trinity College Dublin shows that the brain forms memories of cold experiences and uses them to control our metabolism. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This newly published study is the first to show that cold memories form in the brain, and map out how they subsequently drive thermoregulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109037"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman in the snow." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/memory-metabolism-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;But to identity these engrams they first had to test whether cold memories could form in the first place. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery may have important applications in therapies designed to treat a range of disorders – from obesity to cancer – in which thermoregulation and metabolism (or a lack of control in this area) plays a role, as well as opening the door to more fundamental research, which could help us better understand how memories impact our behaviour and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1897, the physiologist Ivan Pavlov first described classical conditioning, where animals and humans form associations between different aspects of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He showed that dogs could be trained to salivate in hopeful anticipation of food, when an associated bell was rung. Classical or Pavlovian conditioning has since become a core staple of neuroscience and psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term memories are stored in the brain as ensembles of inter-connected cells, termed engrams. Increasingly, modern neuroscience is beginning to identify engrams that encode for bodily representations, such as experiences of infection; inflammation; food consumption; and pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind this work hypothesised that the brain may form engrams for temperature representations, and that these would serve to help an organism survive in changing temperatures. But to identity these engrams they first had to test whether cold memories could form in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While memories are generally measured as changes in animal behaviour, the Ryan Lab collaborated with Prof. Lydia Lynch (then at Trinity College Dublin, now at Princeton University).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They focused on metabolism as a first-order readout of cold experience, because mammals are known to increase their metabolism to create heat in the body when the environment is cold, via a process of adaptive thermogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lead author of the article published today in the leading international journal, &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, Dr Andrea Muñoz Zamora, successfully trained mice to associate a cold experience of 4 °C with novel visual cues that were only present in designated cold contexts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After a few days, mice were presented with the visual cues in the same context, but at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the team discovered that the animals would upregulate their metabolism to induce predictive thermogenesis when they were “expecting” the environment to be cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having established that mice could form memories of cold experiences, the team then delved into how this was happening in the brain. Using activity-dependent gene labelling, the scientists were able to genetically hitchhike onto the engram cells coding for the cold memory in a brain region known as the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, when these cold engram cells were artificially stimulated (using a technique called optogenetics), the mice increased their metabolism in order to generate heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in a converse experiment, to double-check the central finding, when cold engram cells were inhibited the mice were unable to express cold memories in response to the conditioned visual cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Muñoz Zamora&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; said: “We discovered that when mice are exposed to a cold temperature they form memories that allow them to up-regulate their body’s metabolism when they anticipate cold experiences in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Lynch added: “A large part of this learned control of body temperature seems to be due to increased activity of brown adipose tissue – or brown fat – which can be controlled by innervations originating in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our brain must learn from the bodily experiences of cold, but then feeds back to control how our fat cells respond to cold.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Aaron Douglas, who was joint lead author on the study, said: “Numerous clinical disorders, ranging from obesity to forms of cancer, may be treated by manipulating thermoregulation through brown adipose tissue. In the future, it will be important to test whether the manipulation of cold memories in humans could provide novel avenues for altering metabolism for therapeutic purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research opens many new doors for further discovery research, as well as the development of treatments. Understanding how representations of cold experiences affect broader brain functions such as emotion, decision-making, and social behaviour will provide insights into the embodied nature of the mind, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sophisticated aspects of our minds evolved from more basic, visceral, bodily representations,” said Prof. Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how these components of our brain affect our behaviour in general is crucial to understanding our emotions and our use of memory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This integrative piece of work offers a quintessential example of inter-disciplinary science. Neuroscience requires collaboration and it was the synergy with Prof. Lynch that allowed the unusual combination of memory engram work with metabolism research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory and metabolism research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b6d2d3d7d8d3c2def6c2d5d298dfd3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Thomas Deane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tcd.ie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TCD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Thomas Deane – TCD&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08902-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cold memories control whole-body thermoregulatory responses&lt;/a&gt;” by Lydia Lynch et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold memories control whole-body thermoregulatory responses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental thermal challenges trigger the brain to coordinate both autonomic and behavioural responses to maintain optimal body temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unknown how temperature information is precisely stored and retrieved in the brain and how it is converted into a physiological response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we investigated whether memories could control whole-body metabolism by training mice to remember a thermal challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were conditioned to associate a context with a specific temperature by combining thermoregulatory Pavlovian conditioning with engram-labelling technology, optogenetics and chemogenetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report that if mice are returned to an environment in which they previously experienced a 4 °C cold challenge, they increase their metabolic rates regardless of the actual environmental temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we show that mice have increased hypothalamic activity when they are exposed to the cold, and that a specific network emerges between the hippocampus and the hypothalamus during the recall of a cold memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both natural retrieval and artificial reactivation of cold-sensitive memory engrams in the hippocampus mimic the physiological responses that are seen during a cold challenge. These ensembles are necessary for cold-memory retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings show that retrieval of a cold memory causes whole-body autonomic and behavioural responses that enable mice to maintain thermal homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 17:45:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE4wdDZqU2g5S1c4Nk5LQ1VEc2JkRGJqT2RWMVFvM01MdWN0TGJjZllFcVlMd2ppVXJHZlp1M1dleHVieXFIZlM3Q0ZDcnJvVzJNYTMtU1IzV1R3bVI1cGpaSG1fdUdWU2FPUmJ0U2ZuN0dhWGxpMFE</guid></item><item><title>这种饮料可以对抗衰老，促进减肥，并提高能量， doc说： “这是我一直在寻找的神奇子弹” -纽约邮报 | This drink can fight aging, promote weight loss, and boost energy, says doc: ‘It’s the magic bullet I was looking for’ - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPbjg3QlNvSWZ6ZWxwSmNLbE5QYmpvc1FXNzk0YkNoR2N6UXp1bmwyZXRNcTlVYzA5dUpLaEJ6NVpJX2dzMUVYa05BU2JLaUc5YkV4UzBYeDlWQURVWHhsQjQ1cWozUlVmWWp0VzZjdzBpQVFYN0UwRjdXbkZuMW9SaVpVNTl6bC1kQTJYY1JHSXdQQ3Z0em1fSG9seER2bnM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;Proper hydration is crucial — but what if your glass of water could do more than quench your thirst?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a turbocharged drink gaining popularity in the US that proponents say can boost your energy, fight signs of aging and even ward off signs of disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is going to change the world,” &lt;a href="https://www.perriconemd.com/?affil=awin&amp;amp;utm_content=Skimlinks&amp;amp;utm_term=Sub+Networks&amp;amp;utm_source=AWin_78888&amp;amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=AffiliateWin&amp;amp;sv_campaign_id=78888&amp;amp;sv_tax1=affiliate&amp;amp;sv_tax2=&amp;amp;sv_tax3=Skimlinks&amp;amp;sv_tax4=nypost.com&amp;amp;sv_affiliate_id=78888&amp;amp;awc=21122_1745425645_74398e18cd85fc36a8be2ba7660ec167" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Nicholas Perricone&lt;/a&gt;, a renowned nutritionist and dermatologist, told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Perricone’s second book “The Beauty Molecule” was released April 15. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images for the New You Awards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his new book, “&lt;a href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBeauty-Molecule-Introducing-Neuroceuticals-Breakthrough%2Fdp%2F1250286794%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F04%2F15%2Fhealth%2Fboost-production-of-the-beauty-molecule-with-this-diet%2F%26asc_source%3Dwww.google.com%26ascsubtag%3Dsrctok-a9337dbc51f28ec9%26btn_ref%3Dsrctok-a9337dbc51f28ec9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Beauty Molecule: Introducing Neuroceuticals, the Breakthrough for Ageless Beauty&lt;/a&gt;,” Perricone breaks down the science behind the beverage and shares insider tips to maximize every sip.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Looking East for the “magic bullet”&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, Perricone set out on a mission to find what he called the “magic bullet” — an anti-inflammatory that’s nontoxic, affordable, easy to use and widely accessible.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;In Asia, inhaling hydrogen gas for better health and vitality had long been a common practice. But when research out of Japan showed that drinking hydrogen-infused water can boost energy, Perricone’s curiosity was piqued — though he remained skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hydrogen is a nonpolar molecule. It’s not going to interact with the body,” Perricone remembers thinking at the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To get to the bottom of it, Perricone traveled to Tokyo to meet with scientists studying hydrogen. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They explained that, when applied to living cells, hydrogen has a potent antioxidant and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/01/health/blueberries-walnuts-dark-chocolate-reduce-joint-inflammation-doctor/"&gt;anti-inflammatory &lt;/a&gt;effect. It also boosts cellular energy while targeting and neutralizing dangerous free radicals in the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Perricone recommends drinking two cans of hydrogen water per day.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;izzetugutmen – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The toxic hydroxyl radical causes significant damage to cell structures and contributes to their functional decline; in other words, aging,” Perricone wrote in his new book.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back in the US, Perricone, with the help of colleague Dr. Peter Pugliese, began testing the effects of hydrogen water on energy. Their focus was on &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/03/lifestyle/nad-supplement-craze-sweeps-hollywood-but-does-it-work/"&gt;NAD+&lt;/a&gt; and NADH, two forms of the same molecule that plays a key role in cellular energy as well as the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It’s the one of the only molecules in the skin that fluoresces, meaning it emits light or radiation when exposed to certain conditions, such as an LED light.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test whether hydrogen water could boost NADH, Perricone and his team conducted a study in which half the participants drank hydrogen water and the other half had a placebo. Afterward, they were placed under an LED light to track changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perricone expected it to take hours to see any results, but within just two minutes, the first participants’ NADH levels spiked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I sure as hell knew it wasn’t just water,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By the end of the study, participants had a 12.5% average increase in NADH, with the elevated levels lasting for hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This study proved to me that hydrogen can and does increase cellular energy,” Perricone wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can get this country drinking hydrogen water on a regular basis, we could lower our health care costs by a third.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dr. Nicholas Perricone&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A multimillion-dollar bet&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past eight years, Perricone has poured millions into developing his own hydrogen water — using the same technology and methods already popular in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s the magic bullet I was looking for,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not only is hydrogen water simple, inexpensive and nontoxic, but Perricone said it can help normalize metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As we age, one of the biggest killers is the loss of metabolic control, which is seen in an increase in blood sugar, despite an increase in insulin,” Perricone wrote. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hydrogen has been shown to help normalize metabolism.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;olga – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This condition, called &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/30/health/metabolic-syndrome-patients-may-benefit-from-intermittent-fasting-study/"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, causes &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/14/health/this-105-calorie-snack-can-help-lower-your-blood-pressure/"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, elevated blood sugar levels, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/27/health/study-reveals-surprising-brain-boosting-benefit-of-belly-fat/"&gt;belly fat&lt;/a&gt; and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels. It’s linked to a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/20/health/exercising-during-this-3-hour-window-lowers-heart-disease-risk/"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/25/health/avoiding-bright-light-at-night-may-prevent-type-2-diabetes-study/"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/26/health/strokes-may-be-more-devastating-to-smart-people-heres-how/"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/17/health/study-digital-tech-use-lowers-risk-of-brain-decline-by-42/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Perricone believes that hydrogen water could be key in reversing the rise of metabolic syndrome across the country. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He pointed to a study by &lt;a href="https://molecularhydrogeninstitute.org/tyler-lebaron-phd/"&gt;Dr. Tyler LeBaron&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the Molecular Hydrogen Institute, which followed 60 people in India diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Half drank hydrogen water, while the other half drank plain water — with no changes to diet or exercise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After 24 weeks, the results were staggering. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One hundred percent of those drinking hydrogen water no longer had metabolic syndrome, and they also lost an average of seven pounds,” Perricone said, noting that the placebo group showed no improvements. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we can get this country drinking hydrogen water on a regular basis, we could lower our health care costs by a third,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his book, Perricone lists several other benefits associated with hydrogen water, including reducing skin aging, boosting gut health, enhancing nutrient absorption, removing toxins, speeding recovery from workouts and improving muscle tone and joint mobility. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He even says it can combat the toxic effects of alcohol, alleviating &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/health/dietitian-reveals-4-best-foods-for-hangovers-and-4-to-avoid/"&gt;hangovers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/16/health/how-to-sleep-better-while-traveling-from-jet-lag-hacks-to-amenities/"&gt;fight jet lag&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Maximizing the benefits of hydrogen water &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several brans sell hydrogen water, while Perricone has &lt;a href="https://perriconehydrogenwater.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;launched his own line&lt;/a&gt;, priced at $69.00 for a 24-pack of 12 oz cans. It’s proven a quick hit and has already sold out — though they promise to restock soon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Perricone has spent eight years developing his own brand of hydrogen water.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Perricone Hydrogen Water Company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But before you crack open a cold can, there are a few things you should know.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You have to drink it out of the can; you can’t pour it into a glass or sip it through a straw because you’ll lose the hydrogen,” Perricone said. “You also have to drink it within 10 minutes of opening.” &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Perricone recommends drinking hydrogen water twice a day, the same as the participants in the metabolic syndrome study. But he drinks more himself — typically three to four cans per day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It gets rid of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/31/surprising-ways-you-can-blitz-brain-fog-and-sharpen-your-mind/"&gt;brain fog&lt;/a&gt; in the morning very quickly,” he said. “I like to have it midday before a workout and toward the end of the day because I often have a lot of work to do and want to have a nice clear brain.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perricone also believes hydrogen water can be especially helpful for people who play sports, particularly children and teens. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If there’s a quick movement of the head, like in soccer, for example, micro-inflammation is created every time they work out,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I would love to see everybody who works out like this or plays sports to have a can of hydrogen water before or after to stop this low-grade inflammation, because it’s cumulative and can damage the body over time. We want this to start in kindergarten.” &lt;/p&gt;

In a new study, individuals with symptomatic carotid plaque had plastic levels up to 51 times higher than those without plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the presence of plastic didn’t correlate with sudden inflammation, it did alter gene activity in immune cells involved in stabilizing arterial plaque. These findings raise concern about the long-term impact of plastic exposure on cardiovascular health and stroke risk, though more research is needed to determine causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plastic in Plaque:&lt;/strong&gt; Carotid artery plaque in stroke patients contained 51× more micronanoplastics than in healthy arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; High plastic levels changed immune gene activity in plaque-stabilizing cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Plastic buildup in arteries could become a novel risk factor for stroke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AHA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with plaque in the blood vessels of their neck have a higher amount of tiny plastic particles in those vessels compared to people with healthy arteries. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increase was significantly higher in people who had experienced a stroke, mini-stroke or temporary loss of vision due to clogged blood vessels, according to preliminary research presented at the American Heart Association’s Vascular Discovery 2025 Scientific Sessions: From Genes to Medicine, April 22–25 in Baltimore&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109033"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microplastics-stroke-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Researchers say there is currently no effective way to prevent exposure to micronanoplastics. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micronanoplastics are tiny pieces of plastic created in industrial processes or from larger plastic objects as they degrade in the ocean or the soil. Micronanoplastics are not uniform in size and are a mixture of micro and nano plastic sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While microplastics are sometimes visible at less than 5 millimeters in size (5 millimeters is the size of a pencil’s eraser), nanoplastics are microscopic (invisible to the naked eye), less than 1,000 nanometers across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes them more easily dispersed and able to penetrate cells and tissues in living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers suggest that terminology should gradually transition to nanoplastics because that is more precisely what is being studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These types of plastics are commonly found in the environment, especially in ocean garbage patches. Over many years, these plastics break down, mix into the soil and water, and can build up in the food chain,” said lead study author Ross Clark, M.D., M.B.A., R.P.V.I., a vascular surgeon-scientist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people think that micro and nanoplastics mainly come from using plastic utensils, cutting boards, packaging, water bottles and other plastic items. However, the main source is the food and water we eat and drink.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, researchers in Italy reported finding micronanoplastics in plaque from some people without symptoms who underwent surgery to remove carotid artery plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms caused by carotid plaque buildup may include stroke, mini-stroke or temporary blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Followed for almost three years after surgery, people with micronanoplastics in their carotid plaque were significantly more likely to die or to have a non-fatal heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study, which included fewer than 50 participants, was built on the previous research conducted in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers compared the levels of micronanoplastics found in the carotid arteries of three groups: people with healthy arteries; those with plaque but no symptoms; and those experiencing symptoms due to plaque buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also compared plaques with low and high plastic levels to assess the effects of micronanoplastics on markers of inflammation, the gene activity of immune cells called macrophages and stem cells that help stabilize plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis found that the concentration of micronanoplastics in carotid arteries was:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;16 times higher (895 micrograms/gram vs. 57 micrograms/gram) in plaque among people without symptoms compared to the levels found in artery walls of deceased tissue donors of similar age with no plaque; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;51 times higher (2,888 micrograms/gram vs. 57 micrograms/gram) in plaque from people who had experienced stroke, mini-stroke or temporary loss of vision due to blockage of blood flow to the retina, in comparison to samples from age-matched, deceased tissue donors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing high-plastic and low-plastic plaque levels, the analysis found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;no link between the amount of micronanoplastics and signs of sudden inflammation; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;differences in gene activity in plaque-stabilizing cells and less activity in anti-inflammatory genes of plaque macrophage immune cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings indicate that the biological effects of micronanoplastics on fatty deposits are more complex and nuanced than simply causing sudden inflammation,” Clark said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their next phase of work, they will focus on better understanding the immunological effects of micronanoplastics in clogged arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very important to study what these materials do to our bodies. However, we should be cautious about the early results of this study. We won’t fully understand the biological effects for many years to come,” Clark said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has several limitations. It cannot prove that micronanoplastics in plaque were the cause of symptoms of carotid artery disease; micronanoplastics might be a sign of another health issue that caused these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers did not have access to data detailing the sex or race/ethnicity of the tissue donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, used to measure plastic in biological samples may have limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technique allows measurements to include nanoplastics and larger microplastic particles and uses high temperatures to break down plastics into smaller organic molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, parts of the biological samples may also break down into similar molecules. For instance, fatty acids found in artery-clogging plaque could break down into compounds appearing similar to polyethylene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are constantly improving our method to reduce the amounts of lipids in the samples to lessen their impact on the results. Lipids have a very similar spectral signature on gas chromatography as some plastic polymers (in particular polyethylene).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can be challenging to distinguish between the lipids and the polyethylene in the results. That’s why removing the lipids is so important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe our methods are currently the best way to address this specific criticism. However, new discoveries might change how we understand this data in the future,” Clark said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a very interesting and troubling study. To date, we have not considered exposure to plastic micronanoparticles a modifiable risk factor for stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although it is important to understand the mechanism at play in the pathophysiology of symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis, this association presents a novel potential target for stroke prevention,” said Karen L. Furie, M.D., M.P.H., FAHA, volunteer vice chair of the American Heart Association Stroke Brain Health Science Subcommittee and professor and chair of neurology at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Furie was not involved in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study details, background and design:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers tested 48 samples of carotid arteries from 48 different adults collected in 2023-2024 at the University of New Mexico and the Office of the Medical Investigator (a state agency and part of the Department of Pathology at the University of New Mexico).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About one-third of the samples were from people aged 60 to 90 who had surgery to remove plaque from their carotid arteries. These people had symptoms including stroke, mini-stroke or temporary blindness (called amaurosis fugax).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About one-third of the samples came from people of similar age with no symptoms. They were having surgery to remove plaque buildup in their carotid arteries because a blockage was found during screening or a physical exam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The last one-third of the samples came from tissue donors. These age-matched donors had died of any cause and did not have carotid artery blockage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The researchers also compared plaques with low vs. high amounts of micronanoplastics on inflammation-related measures. All samples were analyzed to measure inflammation by looking at levels of inflammatory molecules TNF-α and IL-6. The levels were compared to the amount of plastics to find any connections. For the RNA sequencing studies, researchers examined samples with the highest and lowest concentrations of plastics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#deb5bfacbbb0f0bfadaab2bb9eb6bbbfacaaf0b1acb9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Karen Astle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://heart.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AHA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Karen Astle – AHA&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image:&lt;/strong&gt;

found people who eat more than about 19 bites (or four servings) of chicken per week are more likely to die than those who eat less than 100 grams weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the study appears to have found a concerning link between eating too much chicken - generally considered healthier than red meat because it's lower in saturated fat and cholesterol - and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14512125/sign-stage-four-bowel-cancer-diagnosis-dont-ignore-it.html"&gt;gastrointestinal cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings suggest those eating more than 300 grams weekly had double the risk of an early death from digestive system cancers - the risk was even higher for men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear why consuming just 19 bites of chicken may increase &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-47843ec0-205a-11f0-b59f-e3686b99f796"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study suggests eating just 19 bites of chicken per week could increase your risk of dying by nearly 30 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To investigate a potential link between chicken and early death, researchers from the National Institute of Gastroenterology in Italy collected data on the diets of 4,869 adults, then tracked their health for 19 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each participant provided information about their demographic background, general health status, lifestyle habits and medical history through interviews with the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also recorded their weight, height and blood pressure, and asked them to complete a research-backed questionnaire about their eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The survey included questions about how much red meat, poultry and total meat the participants ate, and this data was sorted into four intake levels per protein type. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the course of the observation period, the researchers kept track of who died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the 1,028 participants who died, white meat accounted for roughly 41 percent of their weekly meat intake, and 29 percent of that was poultry. The remaining 59 percent was red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used statistical analysis to look for a link between poultry consumption and mortality, eliminating the role of other factors such as age, sex and health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/8/1370"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, suggested eating more than 300 grams of chicken per week was associated with a 27 percent increased mortality risk from any cause compared to eating less than 100 grams per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Research by &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://thinkbeef.ca/beef-and-fat/"&gt;Health Canada&lt;/a&gt; shows the different fat concentrations in chicken versus beef, suggesting that chicken may not always be the leaner choice after all &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The findings suggest that those eating more than 300 grams weekly had more than double the risk of early death from digestive system cancers — and for men, the risk was even higher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What's more, the researchers found the risk increased as the portion consumed increased, and was higher compared to eating the same portion of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it doesn't appear to affect everyone the same way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'Our results showed that men have a higher risk than women of dying from [gastrointestinal cancer] for the same proportion of poultry consumed,' the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, men who consumed more than 300 grams of poultry per week were 2.6 times more likely to die from digestive cancer than those who ate less than 100 grams. For the general study population, the risk was only 2.27 times greater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers aren't sure why men are at higher risk, as there is 'no known biological mechanism to explain the observed sex differences,' they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study's findings suggest men who eat more than 300 grams of chicken per week are more likely to die early than woman who eat the same amount &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But differences in sex hormones may play a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study points to previous research in mice that suggests estrogen, a hormone closely associated with female reproductive systems, may influence the ability to metabolize nutrients as well as the risk of developing certain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers note, however, that 'further investigation is needed to support this hypothesis,' and that general dietary differences between men and woman could also play a role, as they suggest women tend to prefer smaller portions and healthier foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the study's alarming findings, there was some evidence to support the idea that poultry is generally healthier than red meat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Higher consumption of red meat was observed among participants who died from non-digestive cancers. Red meat made up 64 percent of weekly meat intake for those that died of these diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study authors noted the research had several limitations, including that the questionnaire used did not ask about different cuts of meat, processed poultry consumption or how the poultry was prepared, which may influence health outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also did not collect data on participants' exercise habits, which plays a critical role in overall health and prevention of early death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also important to note observational studies like this one cannot establish a direct relationship - these findings only point to a possible link between poultry consumption and early death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, the study adds more data to a conflicting body of research on this topic. While some previous studies have identified a similar link, others have found the opposite or no link at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Red meat, however, has been linked to many poor health outcomes, including heart disease, cancer and Type 2 diabetes - thus, chicken has long been touted as the healthier meat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this study raises new questions about that claim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More research is needed to determine exactly how eating poultry affects health - it's an important question as chicken consumption continues to rise in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 16:27:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNOVRCTWJTbTlKa1RreDZfcXlQTHhiYkhqbWZUdTN2djc5Y0M5UGlRWnVwd0VtMGQxSTJyODdhUmRqeEJwc0hubGljMXo1UWVrTkd1NEhKUmswSXRMdjd0dkdjZlJHa1lBVGtNa3F6dXJheEwyeVV5WXdPcmlmcURLTERuQlRGazVZOFZ6Y0ZHaEZEOXUwOUdJOFpqTWZncUFaN3lyVW5LS3N2UGtwWHFweDFCVGN4NVNJLS1HdkFFM3ZRVUhGZmVQNw</guid></item><item><title>迷幻药可能重置大脑免疫链接，驱动恐惧和焦虑-神经科学新闻 | Psychedelics May Reset Brain-Immune Link Driving Fear and Anxiety - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTFBKUXFFb2tzYlNoX2FPT2FUa19TeEVLRFRkN0NhdlFfZlRvSGtFcVE0WDJOT3p1aU1RaFd1eVN1N1ZhRkhUQjNDdFkwSW1tZzh4SFRzNFBzTmhhZGdYZFRMRnFjNDNsa0Q0RGZFeTRCd3ZDazJ4bzN4ZVlTN1lSZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that chronic stress activates immune cells that travel to the brain, amplify inflammation, and heighten fear responses. Researchers found that psychedelics like MDMA and psilocybin disrupt this immune-brain crosstalk, reducing stress-related fear in mice and showing similar effects in human tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest psychedelics may help reset dysfunctional neuroimmune pathways involved in depression, anxiety, and inflammatory diseases. While not a cure-all, this research opens new therapeutic possibilities for targeting the root of emotional and immune dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear-Inflammation Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Stress triggers immune cells to migrate to the brain and activate fear pathways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychedelic Protection:&lt;/strong&gt; MDMA and psilocybin blocked immune-driven fear responses in preclinical models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Similar immune-brain signaling was found in human tissues and depression datasets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Brigham and Women’s Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass General Brigham researchers found that interactions between immune and brain cells drive fear responses, but treatment with psychedelics like MDMA and psilocybin may reverse these effects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that fear and the immune system are connected in previously unknown ways. Researchers at Mass General Brigham found that the immune system can influence stress and fear behaviors by changing how brain cells communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109025"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Prior research has shown immune signaling can drive the development of neuropsychiatric diseases such as major depressive disorder (MDD). Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators further showed that psychedelic treatments could target these neuroimmune interactions and reduce stress-induced fear in preclinical models and found similar results in human tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results are published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study underscores how psychedelics can do more than just change perception; they can help dial down inflammation and reset brain-immune interactions,” said corresponding author Michael Wheeler, PhD, of the Gene Lay Institute of Immunology and Inflammation as well as the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could reshape how we think about treatment for inflammatory disorders and conditions like anxiety and depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research has shown immune signaling can drive the development of neuropsychiatric diseases such as major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the ways that specific immune mechanisms can also affect behaviors due to chronic stress or MDD remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a mouse model of chronic stress, the researchers determined that increased crosstalk between cells in the amygdala, or the brain’s fear center, boosted fear behaviors, elevated inflammatory signaling, and activated fear-promoting amygdala neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, inflammatory immune cells called monocytes migrated from other parts of the body to the brain meninges during chronic stress. The research team demonstrated that artificially manipulating these cells impacted fear behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating stressed mice with psilocybin and MDMA prevented monocytes from accumulating in the brain and lowered fear behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators found similar signals of response to stress in human brain cells and in gene expression datasets from patients with MDD, suggesting that the same interactions between the immune system and the brain may play a role in neuropsychiatric disorders in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that further experiments are needed to understand exactly how psychedelics affect immune cells and brain communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next steps include examining the long-term effects of psychedelic treatment on patients with MDD or inflammatory diseases. Wheeler is currently collaborating with investigators from the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for the Neuroscience of Psychedelics on a clinical trial of patients with depression who are being treated with psychedelics and will examine their tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not saying that psychedelics are a cure-all for inflammatory diseases or any other health condition,” said Wheeler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But we do see evidence that psychedelics have some tissue-specific benefits and that learning more about them could open up entirely new possibilities for treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorship: &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to Wheeler, Mass General Brigham authors include Elizabeth N.

    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;ALSTEAD, N.H. — Brayden Ring’s family and friends say they’ll remember many endearing details about the 21-year-old who died suddenly last month — even down to his sock collection.&lt;/p&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;“He loved to wear socks and slides, and the socks were obnoxious and outrageous (and) the weirder the sock the better,” said Donalin Rock, Brayden’s mother. At Brayden’s 8th-grade graduation from Vilas Middle School, his principal even mentioned his socks, Rock recalled. Some had monkeys and bananas on them. Others had burgers and french fries.&lt;/p&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;“He liked to make fun of himself and he just laughed and just wore what he liked.” &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
      
	

   
     
   

     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;Born in Keene, N.H., and raised in Alstead, N.H., Ring was known for being a carefree and affable soccer goalie who liked listening to the Red Hot Chili Peppers and watching Star Wars. Ring died from pneumonia after getting the flu on March 6.&lt;/p&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;The speed at which his health declined came as a shock to Brayden’s family. In addition to playing hockey and soccer — both of which he competed in at Fall Mountain Regional High School — Rock said her son didn’t smoke or drink alcohol, and had no underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;Ring died during the strongest flu season in the United States since the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.&lt;/p&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;“Influenza varies from season to season for a variety of reasons, some of which we still don’t understand,” said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. This flu season, Schaffner said, hospitalizations were high, as the respiratory virus was “in every part of the country on the severe end of the spectrum.” &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
      
	

   
     
   

     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;While most flu deaths occur among older adults and people with underlying health issues, cases like Brayden’s can happen, according to Schaffner. Hospitalized flu patients, Schaffner said, “can otherwise be completely healthy. This is a testimony to the severity of this virus.” &lt;/p&gt;

    
     

     
       





      






    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;The CDC reports 580,000 hospitalizations from flu-related illnesses in the 2024-25 season, up from 470,000 flu-related hospitalizations in 2023-24. The CDC measures flu activity weekly, but considers the peak of flu season between December and February.&lt;/p&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;Seventy-one Granite Staters died of influenza-related illnesses during the 2024-25 flu season, the highest number of deaths since the state started tracking flu deaths 30 years ago, according to the N.H. Department of Health and Human Services. Hospitals throughout New Hampshire were frequently at or near capacity during the 2024-25 flu season, with Cheshire Medical Center reporting longer wait times due to respiratory illnesses, according to previous Sentinel reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;At the time of his death, Ring was beginning to consider his future. In 2022, he graduated from Fall Mountain Regional High School in Langdon, N.H., and last December he got an associate degree in sports management from N.H. Technical Institute in Concord, where he was on the soccer team. Ring was also working at Bellows Construction in Alstead, according to his family.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
      
	

   
     
   

     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;“He had a lot of things in mind that he wanted to do, he just wasn’t sure yet,” said his father, Stephen Ring. “The one thing I can say for sure is he knew he wanted to work with his hands. He wanted to work outside.” &lt;/p&gt;

    
     

    

    
    

  
    
    &lt;p class="tinytext"&gt;He also had a sense of humor that “was second to none,” Stephen Ring said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LUCAS, Texas — A Collin County middle schooler tested positive for &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;, the first known case in a child in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, Collin County Health Care Services confirmed Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials confirmed one case of measles involving a student who attends Willow Springs Middle School in Lucas, part of Lovejoy Independent School District. According to data from Texas Health and Human Services, 95% of seventh graders in Lovejoy ISD received an MMR vaccine in the 2023-2024 school year. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear if the student was vaccinated. Due to the patient's age, no additional information will be released, health officials said. It's also unclear if the case is linked to the warning Collin County health officials &lt;a href="/article/news/local/measles-plano-texas-stores-collin-county-walmart-exposure-cases/287-94b26b10-e7c7-439b-b08c-3cee0d8ac1f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;previously &lt;/a&gt;issued on April 18 about a person who tested positive for &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; and visited three stores, including a Walmart, in Plano while still infectious.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case announced Tuesday was the first known case of a child contracting the disease in the Metroplex.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two cases previously reported in Rockwall County both involved adults, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four cases of measles, including at least one child, were announced in March by the Paris-Lamar County Health District, which is located northeast of DFW.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services reported 624 cases of measles in the state of Texas on Wednesday morning. The number of cases, mostly from the January West Texas outbreak, increased by 27, the state department said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main measles outbreak has been in the South Plains region of West Texas. Most of the cases have been among unvaccinated children. Two children in Lubbock &lt;a href="/article/news/health/texas-measles-death-outbreak-lubbock/285-636380ac-1d18-4404-999d-b804f40137af" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;have died from the virus&lt;/a&gt;, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is infectious for four days before and four days after a rash appears, the release states. Measles spreads through infectious droplets and the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/vaccine-preventable-diseases/vaccine-preventable-disease-conditions/measles-rubeola" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;. It’s important to note that the measles virus can remain infectious in the air up to two hours after an infected person leaves.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

Standardized data collection could erode, said Michael Kramer, director of The Center for Rural Health and Health Disparities at the Mercer University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-subscription__placeholder subscription-promo b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="11"&gt;“This federal-state partnership has really dramatically improved our understanding of pregnancy-related death,” said Kramer, who has worked with CDC and state researchers on the data system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-nativo_placeholder--moap b-clear-both "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="13"&gt;“We would just be taking huge steps backward if we let that investment go. It would be a travesty for the quality of women’s health care and maternal health in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="14"&gt;Kramer spent a couple of years with other doctors, researchers and experts as a member of a Georgia committee that reviewed autopsy reports, medical files, police reports, and interviews with the deceased womens’ contacts. The committee then debated whether each death was related to the pregnancy. In their final reports, the committee determined that most deaths were preventable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="15"&gt;Georgia’s Department of Public Health and Gov. Brian Kemp have led the Legislature to enact more health coverage for new mothers. The state is piloting home health visits for low-income new mothers and their babies — and is continuing to strengthen the data collection from autopsies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="17"&gt;Ky Lindberg, former CEO at the Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition of Georgia, also served on Georgia’s review committee. Lindberg said she saw the data bloom into new ideas that made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="18"&gt;Lindberg said it felt “euphoric” to help pass the &lt;a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/expansion-of-postpartum-medicaid-from-6-to-12-months-heads-to-governors-desk/J3M5NQDOSRE37DGFSRXOUPI5RY/" target="_blank"&gt;2022 law extending Medicaid coverage to low-income new mothers&lt;/a&gt; for the full year after childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="RP09 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="21"&gt;“It was intoxicating,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="22"&gt;About 141 new mothers died from pregnancy in Georgia from 2020 to 2022. But maternal mortality is a bellwether for larger problems, such as lack of general health access, Lindberg pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="23"&gt;“How the heck will we know if our society is healthy if we remove data sets that are there to inform the work of not only policymakers but more importantly researchers, nonprofit organizations, and practitioners who rely on that information (for) the strategies they’re deploying?” Lindberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="24"&gt;A few states like Georgia started their own maternal mortality review committees more than a decade ago. The death certificate databases alone can be thin and unreliable. The CDC started beefing up another database and officially &lt;a href="https://www.cdcfoundation.org/sites/default/files/files/ReportfromNineMMRCs.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;released MMRIA in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. As more states have joined the effort, MMRIA’s data has become increasingly robust, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="25"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/draft-budget-plan-proposes-deep-cuts-across-federal-health-programs/YD4LNRGQHZDETHKLTZBWZKUCSQ/" target="_blank"&gt;proposed budget&lt;/a&gt; has not been formally acknowledged or verified by the Trump administration but has circulated among federal health workers, including at the CDC. The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions about it last week from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. It was first reported by The Washington Post and the blog Inside Medicine, &lt;a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/draft-budget-plan-proposes-deep-cuts-across-federal-health-programs/YD4LNRGQHZDETHKLTZBWZKUCSQ/" target="_blank"&gt;and has since been reported on by The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="PX01 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="28"&gt;The proposed budget says some federal health programs could be consolidated and moved; the CDC’s base budget could be cut by 44%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="29"&gt;Those cuts would build upon cuts that have already been made. Even if the CDC’s PRAMS infant mortality data set continues, &lt;a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/health-news/cdc-restructuring-pledges-transparency-critics-say-secrecy-will-slow-vital-info-to-public/DUX373NZHBA3VNBTUYR6SIESDM/" target="_blank"&gt;the agency’s experts who built it have already been fired&lt;/a&gt;, the AJC reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="30"&gt;Georgia state Rep. Sharon Cooper, a longtime advocate for maternal health measures in the Georgia Legislature, said she has bad memories about the wonky death certificate data that the study committee she chaired was presented when it took on maternal mortality in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="31"&gt;The Marietta Republican says Georgia can manage without federal funds, and she is certain the state will find the money necessary to continue to work on maternal mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="32"&gt;“I believe that,” Cooper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="34"&gt;Georgia Sen. Sonya Halpern, an Atlanta Democrat on the Senate Health Committee, agreed that the state sees maternal mortality as a priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="35"&gt;“We recognize it’s important and we invest in it. But every state may not to the extent we do,” Halpern said. “We’d be missing the larger picture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="37"&gt;Halpern also concedes that Georgia may have a lot of federal cuts to weigh backfilling. “How much of a federal dollar loss can states actually absorb?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="38"&gt;About half the state’s public health budget is made up of federal funding, state officials have said.

Researchers uncover the cellular and molecular basis for sensing heat and inflammatory pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have discovered clues as to how our bodies turn sensations such as heat and touch into signals sent to the brain — and how these signals can be altered by inflammation to drive pain. The research focuses on the nerve cells in the skin that help us detect the location, intensity, and emotional quality of touch, known as somatosensory neurons. By combining advanced imaging techniques with detailed molecular analysis, the researchers explored how heat and touch activate different types of receptor cells in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To develop better treatments for pain, it’s critical that we deepen our understanding of the biology behind how sensory signals are received, transmitted, and ultimately perceived by the brain,” said Alex Chesler, Ph.D., co-author of the study and senior investigator at NIH. “Over the past few years, we developed a platform for watching sensation in action, revealing new details about the cells and molecules required and, in this study, how inflammation triggers pain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research revealed how different types of cells were “called into action” depending on whether the stimulus was innocuous, such as gentle warmth or touch, or noxious, meaning a stimulus strong enough to potentially cause damage to normal tissue. For example, heat and gentle touch were transmitted by entirely different types of cells. When the stimulus was more intense, the nerve cells began to overlap in their roles for transmitting the sensations of heat and pressure, providing an explanation for how cells detect and distinguish between innocuous and noxious stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is well known to be linked to pain, but the understanding of what is happening on the cellular and molecular levels is less clear. In their experiments, researchers injected prostaglandin E2 into the skin, a molecule that causes inflammation and drives pain. With the inflammatory response set into motion, researchers found that certain neurons used for signaling pain (nociceptors) became active and sensitized to heat for a long duration, demonstrating the cellular processes at play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This explains how inflammation drives ongoing pain and why heat becomes more painful,” said Nick Ryba, Ph.D., co-author and senior investigator at NIH. “However, what was unexpected was that touch detection remained unchanged.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study found that inflammation-related hypersensitivity to touch, known as tactile allodynia, was caused by the ongoing nociceptor activity induced by inflammation superimposed on the normal sensation of touch. This finding is consistent with previous research at NIH showing that the ion channel &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/news/press-releases/study-identifies-gene-that-makes-gentle-touch-feel-painful-after-injury"&gt;PIEZO2 plays a crucial role in this type of pain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research is part of a long-term collaboration between the groups headed by Drs. Chesler and Ryba. Together these labs conduct basic research focusing on how sensory input is detected and processed by the brain to evoke specific behaviors. According to Dr. Chesler, even though this study is in mice, the similarities to humans in the neural pathways far outweigh the differences, so the findings hold important implications for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By learning more about how touch and heat are signaled in the body, we’re identifying new clues for treating pain,” said Dr. Chesler. “Our study shows how different types of pain may benefit from different types of treatments. In short, by identifying exactly which cells and molecules ‘turn up the volume’ of different types of pain, we may be able to identify the ‘switches’ that can turn the volume down.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was led by investigators in the Sensory Cells and Circuits Lab at NIH’s National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health and the Taste and Smell Section at NIH’s National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research.&lt;/p&gt;

Coli is undercooked ground beef, where bacteria can spread during processing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But leafy greens like romaine and spinach are another major culprit, often contaminated in the field through tainted water or contact with livestock.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, pictured at left, died of colon cancer earlier this year at age 26. Evan White, pictured at right with his fiancee and dog, died of colon cancer at age 29&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raw milk and other unpasteurized dairy products also pose a risk, along with raw produce like apples, cucumbers, and especially sprouts — which provide the perfect warm, moist environment for bacteria to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;E. Coli can also sneak in through contaminated water, which may be used to irrigate crops or clean equipment, and poor kitchen hygiene can help it spread to other foods like poultry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ludmil Alexandrov, senior study author and professor of cellular and molecular medicine at the University of California San Diego, said: 'These mutation patterns are a kind of historical record in the genome, and they point to early-life exposure to colibactin as a driving force behind early-onset disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This reshapes how we think about cancer. It might not be just about what happens in adulthood—cancer could potentially be influenced by events in early life, perhaps even the first few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sustained investment in this type of research will be critical in the global effort to prevent and treat cancer before it’s too late.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of under-50s being diagnosed with bowel cancer is increasing worldwide, according to a major global study published last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An increase in rates was reported in 27 of the 50 countries examined by US researchers, with the greatest annual increases seen in New Zealand (4 percent), Chile (4 percent) and England (3.6 percent). &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest data, early-onset colon cancer diagnoses in the US are expected to rise by 90 percent in people 20 to 34 years old between 2010 and 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In teens, rates have surged 500 percent since the early 2000s.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and 52,900 will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, 44,063 cases are diagnosed per year, and the nation sees 16,808 deaths every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest study, published Wednesday in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09025-8"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, looked at the DNA of 981 colon cancer tumors in patients who were either under 40 or over 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients were spread across 11 countries, including the US and UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Evan White lost his four-year battle with colon cancer at age 29&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Carly Barrett, from Kentucky, was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 24 after detecting blood in her stool and suffering from abdominal pain. She is still battling the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found colibactin leaves behind specific patterns of DNA mutations that were 3.3 times more common in early-onset cases than in those diagnosed after the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These mutations were also most common in countries with high rates of early-onset colon cancer, such as the US and UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While earlier research has linked colibactin-related mutations to around 10 to 15 percent of all colorectal cancer cases, those studies mostly looked at older patients or didn’t separate early-onset from late-onset disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This new study is the first to show that these cancer-driving mutations are significantly more common in younger patients, suggesting a unique link between childhood exposure and early-onset colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marcos Diaz-Gay, first study author and former postdoctoral researcher in Alexandrov's lab, said: 'When we started this project, we weren’t planning to focus on early-onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our original goal was to examine global patterns of colorectal cancer to understand why some countries have much higher rates than others. But as we dug into the data, one of the most interesting and striking findings was how frequently colibactin-related mutations appeared in the early-onset cases.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the increase in US colorectal cancers in men and women from 2000 through 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;E coli bacteria sickens 265,000 Americans, with young children being the most at risk. Children may catch it at petting zoos or by eating contaminated foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found colibactin-related mutations start early in colon tumor development, with is consistent with previous research suggesting these mutations occur in the first 10 years of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found colibactin-related mutations account for 15 percent of APC driver mutations, which are some of the earliest genetic alterations directly linked to cancer, in colon cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alexandrov said: 'If someone acquires one of these driver mutations by the time they're 10 years old, they could be decades ahead of schedule for developing colorectal cancer, getting it at age 40 instead of 60.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most strands of E. coli are harmless, though six strains produce toxins like colibactin. Toxin-producing strains include siga toxin-producing (STEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), enteroinvasive (EIEC), enteroaggregative (EAEC) and diffusely adherent (DAEC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toxin-producing E. coli can cause bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting and fever. In severe cases, it can lead to dehydration and hemolytic uremic syndrome, a kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found despite the notable rises in the US and UK, the researchers found colon cancers in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Russia and Thailand were had the largest increases in colibactin-related mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diaz-Gay said: 'It’s possible that different countries have different unknown causes. That could open up the potential for targeted, region-specific prevention strategies.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers plan to investigate how children are being exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria and if medications like probiotics can eliminate harmful strains of bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also plans to look into how environmental exposures later in life can increase the risk of colon cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alexandrov said: 'Not every environmental factor or behavior we study leaves a mark on our genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But we’ve found that colibactin is one of those that can. In this case, its genetic imprint appears to be strongly associated with colorectal cancers in young adults.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Coli is undercooked ground beef, where bacteria can spread during processing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But leafy greens like romaine and spinach are another major culprit, often contaminated in the field through tainted water or contact with livestock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the increase in US colorectal cancers in men and women from 2000 through 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, pictured at left, died of colon cancer earlier this year at age 26. Evan White, pictured at right with his fiancee and dog, died of colon cancer at age 29&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raw milk and other unpasteurized dairy products also pose a risk, along with raw produce like apples, cucumbers, and especially sprouts — which provide the perfect warm, moist environment for bacteria to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;E. Coli can also sneak in through contaminated water, which may be used to irrigate crops or clean equipment, and poor kitchen hygiene can help it spread to other foods like poultry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ludmil Alexandrov, senior study author and professor of cellular and molecular medicine at the University of California San Diego, said: 'These mutation patterns are a kind of historical record in the genome, and they point to early-life exposure to colibactin as a driving force behind early-onset disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This reshapes how we think about cancer. It might not be just about what happens in adulthood—cancer could potentially be influenced by events in early life, perhaps even the first few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sustained investment in this type of research will be critical in the global effort to prevent and treat cancer before it’s too late.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest data, early-onset colon cancer diagnoses in the US are expected to rise by 90 percent in people 20 to 34 years old between 2010 and 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In teens, rates have surged 500 percent since the early 2000s.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and 52,900 will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, 44,063 cases are diagnosed per year, and the nation experiences 16,808 deaths every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published Wednesday in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09025-8"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, looked at the DNA of 981 colon cancer tumors in patients who were either under 40 or over 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients were spread across 11 countries, including the US and UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Evan White lost his four-year battle with colon cancer at age 29&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Carly Barrett, from Kentucky, was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 24 after detecting blood in her stool and suffering from abdominal pain. She is still battling the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found colibactin leaves behind specific patterns of DNA mutations that were 3.3 times more common in early-onset cases than in those diagnosed after the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These mutations were also most common in countries with high rates of early-onset colon cancer, such as the US and UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While earlier research has linked colibactin-related mutations to around 10 to 15 percent of all colorectal cancer cases, those studies mostly looked at older patients or didn’t separate early-onset from late-onset disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This new study is the first to show that these cancer-driving mutations are significantly more common in younger patients, suggesting a unique link between childhood exposure and early-onset colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marcos Diaz-Gay, first study author and former postdoctoral researcher in Alexandrov's lab, said: 'When we started this project, we weren’t planning to focus on early-onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our original goal was to examine global patterns of colorectal cancer to understand why some countries have much higher rates than others. But as we dug into the data, one of the most interesting and striking findings was how frequently colibactin-related mutations appeared in the early-onset cases.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;E coli bacteria sickens 265,000 Americans, with young children being the most at risk. Children may catch it at petting zoos or by eating contaminated foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found colibactin-related mutations start early in colon tumor development, with is consistent with previous research suggesting these mutations occur in the first 10 years of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found colibactin-related mutations account for 15 percent of APC driver mutations, which are some of the earliest genetic alterations directly linked to cancer, in colon cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alexandrov said: 'If someone acquires one of these driver mutations by the time they're 10 years old, they could be decades ahead of schedule for developing colorectal cancer, getting it at age 40 instead of 60.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And despite the notable rises in the US and UK, the researchers found colon cancers in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Russia and Thailand were had the largest increases in colibactin-related mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diaz-Gay said: 'It’s possible that different countries have different unknown causes. That could open up the potential for targeted, region-specific prevention strategies.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers plan to investigate how children are being exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria and if medications like probiotics can eliminate harmful strains of bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also plans to look into how environmental exposures later in life can increase the risk of colon cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alexandrov said: 'Not every environmental factor or behavior we study leaves a mark on our genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But we’ve found that colibactin is one of those that can. In this case, its genetic imprint appears to be strongly associated with colorectal cancers in young adults.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Gold dust in eyes might seem like an unusual therapy – but a new mouse study in the US shows the approach could potentially treat age-related&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"&gt; macular degeneration&lt;/a&gt; (AMD) and other eye problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macular degeneration affects millions worldwide and becomes more likely as we age. Damage to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macula"&gt;macula&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"&gt;retina&lt;/a&gt; and containing light-sensitive &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell"&gt;photoreceptor cell&lt;/a&gt;s, causes blurring and other vision issues. While there are treatments available to slow the progression of AMD, they don't reverse it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a new type of retinal prosthesis that has the potential to restore vision lost to retinal degeneration without requiring any kind of complicated surgery or genetic modification," &lt;a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-04-16/goldeneyes"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biomedical engineer Jiarui Nie, from Brown University in Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We believe this technique could potentially transform treatment paradigms for retinal degenerative conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158745" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158745" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/StudyDesign.jpg" alt="Study design" class="wp-image-158745 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/StudyDesign.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/StudyDesign-600x369.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158745" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The study combined gold nanoparticles with infrared light. (Nie et al., &lt;em&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how the new treatment works: very fine gold nanoparticles, thousands of times thinner than a human hair, are laced &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"&gt;with antibodies&lt;/a&gt; to target specific eye cells. They're then injected into the gel-filled vitreous chamber between the retina and the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, a small infrared laser device is used to excite these nanoparticles and activate specific cells in the same way photoreceptors do. If the treatment makes it to us humans as well, that laser could be embedded in a pair of glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mice this was tested on, engineered to have retinal disorders, the treatment method was effective at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-stem-cell-transplant-restores-vision-in-multiple-people"&gt;restoring vision&lt;/a&gt;, at least partly (it's tricky to give a mouse a full eye test). It showed the nanoparticles could help bypass damaged photoreceptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158746" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158746" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EyeImprovements.jpg" alt="Eye improvements" class="wp-image-158746 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EyeImprovements.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EyeImprovements-600x246.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158746" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Improvements in vision were seen in the study mice. (Nie et al., &lt;em&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We showed that the nanoparticles can stay in the retina for months with no major toxicity," &lt;a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-04-16/goldeneyes"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And we showed that they can successfully stimulate the visual system. That's very encouraging for future applications."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach has similarities to existing treatments &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/results-of-3-year-clinical-trial-show-the-bionic-eye-safely-restores-vision"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for AMD and related conditions such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/results-of-3-year-clinical-trial-show-the-bionic-eye-safely-restores-vision"&gt;retinitis pigmentosa&lt;/a&gt;. However, this new method is less invasive, with no surgery or large implants inside the eye needed, and also promises to cover a wider field of vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most studies in mice, there's a good chance the findings will translate over to humans, but it'll take a while to get there – and to get something safe that can be approved for use. This is an important first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of studies are presenting ways in which eye diseases could be tackled by the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lab-grown-retinas-to-restore-vision-are-a-step-closer-to-human-trials"&gt;latest technology&lt;/a&gt; and science, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-new-way-to-activate-dormant-cells-in-the-retina-could-restore-vision"&gt;reprogramming other retinal cells&lt;/a&gt; to replace photoreceptors that are no longer working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This innovation marks a significant breakthrough, setting the stage for future development of photothermal retinal prostheses such as wearable goggles," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c14061"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For future human applications, further refinement is necessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c14061"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NCDHHS Urges Public and Providers to Be on Alert &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RALEIGH – The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services is asking people and providers to be on alert for mpox cases following the detection of mpox particles in multiple sewage samples found through routine wastewater testing. This year there have been two cases of mpox in North Carolina and the new wastewater detections were determined to be another type, clade I, not previously found in North Carolina. These detections indicate potential undiagnosed or unreported cases. At this time, the risk to the public remains low.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/mpox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mpox virus&lt;/a&gt;, formerly known as monkeypox, is primarily spread by prolonged close contact, typically skin-to-skin, often during sexual activity. There are two genetic types of the virus, known as clade I and clade II. The viral particles found in wastewater were determined to be clade I. To date, only four clade I cases have been reported in the U.S. Clade I mpox is responsible for a large outbreak in Central and Eastern Africa, which appears to be spreading mostly through heterosexual contact with some spread to household members, including children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;North Carolina’s detections were found in wastewater samples collected on March 25, March 28, and April 8 from a treatment plant in Greenville, NC. No clade I cases have been reported to date; however, these detections mean there was possibly at least one person with an undiagnosed or unreported clade I mpox infection present or traveling through the Greenville area around the time of these detections.&lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p class="td-g-rec td-g-rec-id-content_inline tdi_2 td_block_template_1 "&gt;


&lt;noscript id="td-ad-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  





&lt;p&gt;“The detection of clade I mpox virus in wastewater surveillance tells us the virus is potentially here in our state, even though no cases have been reported and confirmed,” said NC Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai. “We encourage health care providers to be on the lookout for mpox cases and we encourage people who are at higher risk to protect themselves by getting vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NCDHHS requests that all North Carolina health care providers consider mpox in patients with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;compatible symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and ask about any recent international travel. Providers who are treating patients with mpox infections should contact their local health department or the NCDHHS Division of Public Health’s 24/7 epidemiologist on-call number: 919-733-3419.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These recent results were found by the North Carolina Wastewater Monitoring Network, which launched in 2021 to better understand the spread of certain viruses in communities across North Carolina. This network is a collaboration between NCDHHS, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, wastewater utilities and local health departments. Samples are collected routinely from 35 wastewater treatment plants across the state and tested for specific viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). People with these viruses shed viral particles in their stool even if they don’t have symptoms. These virus particles are no longer infectious but can still be detected through lab testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While wastewater surveillance has become a valuable tool for tracking and responding to viruses, the program is now at risk due to proposed federal funding cuts. Wastewater surveillance funding allows North Carolina to have a crucial early warning system for levels of infections that can help public health officials and health care providers make decisions, such as providing guidance on how to prevent infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NC Wastewater Monitoring Network results are routinely shared on the &lt;a href="https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard/wastewater-monitoring" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NCDHHS wastewater monitoring dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. Testing for mpox is done on samples from 18 of the participating sites and results are shared on the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/wastewater-surveillance/mpox-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC Mpox wastewater dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you think you have mpox or have had close contact with someone who has mpox, visit your health care provider or contact your local health department. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Symptoms&lt;/a&gt; include a rash on any part of the body, like the genitals, hands, feet, chest, face or mouth. The rash can initially look like pimples or blisters and may be painful or itchy. The rash will go through several stages, including scabs, before healing. Some people experience flu-like symptoms before the rash, while others get a rash first followed by other symptoms. In some cases, a rash is the only symptom experienced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are available to protect against mpox infection from both clade types and can reduce the severity of illness if infection does occur.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

'We drive there the afternoon before infusions, then we have a full infusion day from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and then we drive home. We couldn't be happier with the team of physicians and nurses that care for her.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Begbie family has started a foundation called the Rowan Tree Foundation of East Tennessee to help raise money to find a treatment for Sanfilippo and help other families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's overwhelming, we've seen friends and people from every corner of our lives show up for us over the last year and it's been absolutely amazing,' her parents said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have super generous and talented people that surround us and love us that helped us put today together.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sanfilippo affects just 5,000 Americans and causes dementia-like symptoms in children, including the inability to speak, walk, eat on their own or remember any of the skills they've learned throughout their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It impacts about one in 70,000 births every year and develops when each parent passes on a faulty gene. Most sufferers begin to deteriorate around four years old and don't live past their early teen years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rowan's parents described her as a joyous little girl who loves her community and family&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rowan has Sanfilippo syndrome type A, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis (MSP)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In people with Sanfilippo syndrome, they lack an enzyme that breaks down a waste product produced in the body, which leads to their brains becoming 'clogged with toxic levels' of the material, according to the Cure Sanfilippo Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Signs and symptoms include a mild speech delay, hyperactivity, irritability, coarse and excess hair growth, coarse facial features, severe sleeping problems, respiratory infections, ear infections, digestive issues and a wobbly walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the toxicity levels build in the brain, it can lead to seizures, movement issues and chronic pain, but because of its behavioral symptoms, Sanfilippo is often initially misdiagnosed as &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/adhd/index.html" id="mol-6b8d4ce0-2045-11f0-a8b4-f7fbf2ff7f43"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; or autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are four subtypes of the condition depending on which enzyme is missing or broken. Across the globe, MPS IIIA is the most common and makes up more than half of the cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also considered the most severe, causing symptoms and death at earlier ages, according to the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no approved cure for the disease but the Sanfilippo Foundation said research and clinical trials for enzyme replacements are working toward treatments that could potentially slow the progression of the disease and extend a patient's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have pinpointed the 'magic number' of weekly intimate encounters needed to ward off depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There's no need for sex marathons — just once a week is enough to boost mental health, the researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts from the Shantou University Medical College found that those who have sex at least once a week have significantly lower odds of depression, compared to those who do so less than once a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the study, which involved 14,741 US adults, revealed that weekly intimacy could reduce the risk of developing symptoms of the mood disorder by 24 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This effect was most prominent among younger adults, aged 20 to 30, who saw greater protection from depressive feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists theorised that the effect may lie with the release of the 'feel good' hormones such as endorphins and dopamine that happens during sex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These chemicals surge by 200 per cent during intimate acts, and are known to help with pain and stress relief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Regardless of sexual orientation, sexual activity offers benefits such as enhanced wellbeing and quality of life, significantly impacting mental health', co-author professor Mutong Chen said of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;People who have less sex may be putting their health in jeopardy, a group of scientists have claimed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-473b3df0-2051-11f0-87ee-e31941004579" class=""&gt;Depression&lt;/a&gt; affects around 280million people globally. Yet, available treatments, such as talking therapy and antidepressant drugs, are only effective in around half of cases, some studies show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, researchers recruited participants aged 20 to 59, and asked them to complete a survey about their sex lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were also tasked with completing a survey commonly used to diagnose depression, called the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results revealed that while around 7.5 per cent of participants had moderate to severe depression, having sex more than once a month significantly reduced the odds of experiencing symptoms of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who reported having weekly sex saw the biggest benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst researchers found that increasing sexual frequency had a positive effect on psychological well-being, additional protection against depression &lt;span&gt;appeared to peak at around 103 times per year — which is approximately twice a week. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers hope the findings will help to shed new light on the emotional benefits of sex and help highlight the need to explore alternative treatments for managing depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These senescent cells accumulate with age or injury and cause inflammation, pain, and tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When administered orally to mice, the drugs reduced inflammation, relieved pain, and even reversed disc damage, with the greatest benefits seen when both drugs were combined. This groundbreaking approach could transform treatment for millions with chronic back pain by targeting the source, not just the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Root Cause Targeted:&lt;/strong&gt; Zombie-like senescent cells drive inflammation in spinal discs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Drug Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; o-Vanillin and RG-7112 worked best when used together.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral Success:&lt;/strong&gt; Drugs delivered by mouth reached hard-to-access spinal discs and reversed damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;McGill University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a preclinical study led by McGill University researchers, two drugs targeting “zombie cells” have been shown to treat the underlying cause of chronic low back pain. The condition affects millions of people worldwide.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current treatments manage symptoms through painkillers or surgery, without addressing the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109017"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a spine." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results offer some of the first evidence that o-Vanillin can clear out zombie cells. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings are exciting because it suggests we might be able to treat back pain in a completely new way, by removing the cells driving the problem, not just masking the pain,” said senior author Lisbet Haglund, a Professor in McGill’s Department of Surgery and Co-director of the Orthopaedic Research Laboratory at the Montreal General Hospital (MUHC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was conducted by McGill’s Alan Edwards Centre for Research on Pain at the Montreal General Hospital, part of the MUHC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treating pain at the source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senescent cells, often called zombie cells, build up in the spinal discs as people age or when discs are damaged. Instead of dying off like normal cells, these aging cells linger and cause inflammation, pain and damage to the spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore a potential solution, the research team administered two drugs orally to mice: o-Vanillin, a natural compound, and RG-7112, an FDA-approved cancer drug. They were administered together as well as separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found the drugs could clear zombie cells from the spine, reduce pain and inflammation, and slow or even reverse damage to spinal discs after eight weeks of treatment. Each of the drugs had a beneficial effect, but the impact was greatest when they were administered together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised that an oral treatment could reach the spinal discs, which are hard to access and present a major hurdle in treating back pain,” said Haglund. “The big question now is whether these drugs can have the same effect in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A natural compound’s surprising potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, o-Vanillin wasn’t originally intended to be part of the study and was included almost by chance. Haglund explained that while testing other drugs, her team decided to add the compound, derived from turmeric and known for its anti-inflammatory properties, to see whether it might be effective in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results offer some of the first evidence that o-Vanillin can clear out zombie cells. Analogs of RG-7112 are known to do this in osteoarthritis and cancer research, but had not been used to treat back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Haglund’s team will work to improve o-Vanillin’s structure to help it stay in the body longer to become even more effective. They believe these drugs have the potential to treat other age-related diseases driven by senescent cells, such as arthritis or osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Senolytic Treatment for Low Back Pain” by Matthew Mannarino, Hosni Cherif and Lisbet Haglund et al., was published in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, The Arthritis Society, Le Réseau de Recherche en Santé Buccodentaire et Osseuse and the Louise and Alan Edwards Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this pain research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fb909e92979ad59f9e8b9a8b9ebb96989c929797d5989a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Keila DePape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mcgill.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Keila DePape – McGill University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adr1719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Senolytic treatment for low back pain&lt;/a&gt;” by Lisbet Haglund et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Senolytic treatment for low back pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senescent cells (SnCs) accumulate because of aging and external cellular stress throughout the body. They adopt a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and release inflammatory and degenerative factors that actively contribute to age-related diseases, such as low back pain (LBP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senolytics, &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt;-vanillin and RG-7112, remove SnCs in human intervertebral discs (IVDs) and reduce SASP release, but it is unknown whether they can treat LBP. &lt;em&gt;sparc&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, with LBP, were treated orally with &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt;-vanillin and RG-7112 as single or combination treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment reduced LBP and SASP factor release and removed SnCs from the IVD and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment also lowered degeneration scores in the IVDs, improved vertebral bone quality, and reduced the expression of pain markers in the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, our data suggest RG-7112 and &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt;-vanillin as potential disease-modifying drugs for LBP and other painful disorders linked to cell senescence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:37:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTFBBb3lBckpqc3Q5NDFFcGNFUGQwbXRVWWhwZlhNR3dSekZGUkNfODc0cnVQQ2ljaUoyNE53T2JiTXNlUWxpdlJGSS1xZXhMY2hSbk1MNGY4aURSZk0zN2s4SWNTcw</guid></item><item><title>步行真的能帮助你活得更久吗？本研究建议“是” -超过十年- AOL.com | Can Walking Really Help You Live Longer?

By comparing the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64364908/muscle-activation-technique/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:most active;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;most active&lt;/a&gt; participants to those with the least amount of physical activity, scientists found that &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64538249/walking-aging-longevity-11-minutes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:life expectancy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; was positively correlated with exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the least active 25 percent of Americans matched the top quarter, they would need to add about 111 minutes of daily walking (or an equivalent activity) to their routine. But the rewards were significant: It could, in theory, increase their lifespans by up to 11 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perks weren't as big for already-active participants, but still notable: Those in the second-lowest activity group who walked about 83 extra minutes a day could add 4.6 years to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can walking add 11 years to my life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's tough to say—this is just one study and it only tracked the activity of people over four days. Also, there are a lot of factors that go into how long you live, making it difficult to pin it all on one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, there does seem to be a connection between moving more and longevity.

You can just go for a walk in the morning or evening, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, just do what you can do squeeze in some more steps on a regular basis—it could help you live longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:22:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE1UWTRyN3BtYktxRGVIa3ZuTmJZN0RiM3VmT2Y3VFRDZXRjT0sxYU1Fb0pRbkJqRDBadVdxYnlnbEZDY0k3MlJwbmxfUFMtd0M4XzNkc25RdHdRT25ZRWJWcHN3QkhDVl9USGhtRjFUbWhqQjhj</guid></item><item><title>西澳大利亚州确诊第五例麻疹病例，发现地点- MyNorthwest.com | Fifth measles case in WA confirmed, locations revealed - MyNorthwest.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTFA1VmFkaFZMMWgwRkZRUWR1TGZ3WVNzdFVveVhzOE1naVlubmxPZHB0N2ZYejYyZk9VMHZXYTVFclFCdGpJREFiX2EtbkpOUWV1YWJfWC1kWndMMGpocnpVS01hdmNDaHBrWHVB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story_body"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;An infant in King County contracted measles, making it the fifth case this year in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Health – Seattle and King County reported that the infant traveled through Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac) last Tuesday while infectious with measles, and was at some specific locations at Seattle Children’s Hospital while contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infant had not yet been vaccinated against the measles, and was likely exposed during a recent trip out of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles outbreaks are happening in every part of the world. If you are planning international travel, it’s important to speak with your healthcare provider about what vaccines may be needed,” Elysia Gonzales, medical epidemiologist for Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County, said. “Children need two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the five measles cases in Washington this year, three were infants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The specific locations where the infant with measles was&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 15, the infant and their family were at Sea-Tac Airport from 4:50 p.m. until 7:45 p.m. They were at S Concourse (Gate S10), the international arrivals facility for customs, and baggage claim (Carousel 21) before exiting through Gina Marie Hall (south end of main terminal).&lt;/p&gt;
                            
                        
&lt;p&gt;Two days later, the family went to Seattle Children’s Hospital’s Emergency Department from 8:45 a.m. to 1 p.m. and again from 5:30 p.m. until 7:45 p.m. Beyond the waiting room, the infant was also in the Forest B level 1 lobby and its pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, April 18, the family returned to Seattle Children’s Hospital’s Emergency Department. From 12:05 p.m. until 2:25 p.m., the infant and the family were in the Ocean 6, 7, and 8 lobbies, the Ocean 8 hallway to urgent care, and the Ocean 8 urgent care lobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were at the locations at the times listed above and are not immune to measles, the most likely time you would become sick would be between April 22 and May 11. People who are immuno-compromised may take longer to experience symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

Treated mice adapted more quickly in rule-switching tasks, indicating enhanced neuroplasticity in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest psychedelics may offer lasting cognitive benefits, with potential applications for treating depression, PTSD, and neurodegenerative diseases. Both male and female mice benefited, and the study’s advanced testing system may accelerate future research into targeted psychedelic therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Lasting Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; One dose of 25CN-NBOH improved learning adaptability for 15–20 days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice showed enhanced performance on reversal learning tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Effects were observed in both sexes, with implications for treating cognitive disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Genomic Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a groundbreaking research study, University of Michigan researchers have discovered that a single dose of a psychedelic compound can enhance cognitive flexibility—the brain’s ability to adapt to changing circumstances—for weeks after administration, potentially revolutionizing treatments for depression, PTSD, and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Psychedelics&lt;/em&gt;, demonstrates that mice treated with a single dose of 25CN-NBOH, a selective serotonin 2A receptor agonist, showed markedly improved performance in reversal learning tasks compared to control groups when tested 2-3 weeks after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109013"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person and swirly lines." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Importantly, the study found that both male and female mice showed significant improvements in cognitive flexibility, suggesting the potential broad applicability of psychedelic therapy across biological sexes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What makes this discovery particularly significant is the sustained duration of cognitive benefits following just one psychedelic dose,” explains Professor Omar J. Ahmed, the study’s senior, corresponding author from the University of Michigan’s Department of Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We observed enhanced learning adaptability that persisted for weeks, suggesting these compounds may induce lasting and behaviorally meaningful neuroplasticity changes in the prefrontal cortex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an innovative automated sequential learning paradigm, researchers measured how effectively mice could adapt to rule reversals—a standard test for cognitive flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psychedelic-treated mice demonstrated superior adaptability compared to saline controls, with enhanced task efficiency, higher percentages of correct trials, and increased reward acquisition during the reversal phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Brain Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results complement existing cellular research showing psychedelic-induced structural remodeling in the prefrontal cortex but uniquely demonstrate sustained cognitive benefits persisting long after the immediate effects of the drug have dissipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As interest in psychedelic medicine continues to grow, this research raises intriguing questions about how psychedelics might reshape neural pathways governing flexible thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could these compounds potentially reopen critical periods of brain plasticity? What molecular mechanisms underlie these long-lasting cognitive improvements? How might the timing and frequency of administration affect long-term neuroplasticity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current study focused on the long-term effects of a single psychedelic dose. A key question is what happens with two, three, or even twenty doses taken over several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Is every additional dose increasingly beneficial for flexible learning or is there a plateau effect or even a negative effect of too many doses? These are important questions to answer next in the quest to make psychedelic medicine more rational and mechanistic,” according to Dr. Ahmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex Differences and Clinical Potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study found that both male and female mice showed significant improvements in cognitive flexibility, suggesting the potential broad applicability of psychedelic therapy across biological sexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most striking aspect of our findings is that these cognitive benefits were measured 15-20 days after a single psychedelic administration,” notes Elizabeth J. Brouns, first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that a single dose of a psychedelic isn’t just temporarily altering perception, but potentially inducing lasting beneficial changes in brain function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodological Advances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s automated behavioral task represents a significant methodological advance for evaluating flexible learning, enabling researchers to efficiently evaluate cognitive flexibility in future investigations of psychedelic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This high-throughput approach could accelerate the development of targeted psychedelic therapies for specific cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and neuroplasticity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d1bcb0bdb8ffa6bebfb691b6b4bfbebcb8b2a1a3b4a2a2ffb2bebc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ma-Li Wong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Genomic Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ma-Li Wong – Genomic Press&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.61373/pp025r.0002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Single-dose psychedelic enhances cognitive flexibility and reversal learning in mice weeks after administration&lt;/a&gt;” by Omar J.

            The United States has seen progress in reducing certain cancer risks, as overall smoking rates remain on a decline. But for other risk factors, such as those tied to cervical cancer, there is room for improvement, according to a new American Cancer Society report.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The prevalence of people smoking fell from about 14% in 2019 to 11% in 2023, according to the report published Wednesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC-2B4M3whl4oys2dRqXQUpBS-2BtME2cdcP5-2Fzwyk4wkYUBo8m49mUeO92iYSkvLQAJINQ-3D-3D7--Y_-2BfvDFm8rLlMG3DiFVwLpkkmQZ5tK1QI-2Bs-2FpJe6gRjYIK1XFj6zR1wY-2F1FgAYynw6K4-2Bl7TMadhQ9W-2Bo9QZg2Rj7MXKRbkCN5xWuHUBqrIVNI2alfkNwo317m3FEpNGnhzpUOaRIQ59tQUesFqbY1D-2BJRj2bxu9B9-2F3QX8fO5cS1-2Bpad0GUhRk77nEthdHu6VzRdF46PjrvFK3BctkuEjBV6kP-2FoYdSF1TZRQqEFWBbauRqoGvIVJqndsjt61k-2BFvZbK2SUqCBVgDKqiJz5GdzHec5MXgY9MjhdzIZxApYr-2FT3XJWsHwdPIs7lx5xOekByiJD1fL8pD8zo30wytdG6SzuvArKKqm1vO8-2BYjYcUX8-3D" target="_blank"&gt;Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp;amp; Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Cigarette smoking is known to significantly increase the risk of developing cancer. It’s estimated to cause about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/about/cigarettes-and-cancer.html" target="_blank"&gt;1 out of every 3 cancer deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “These latest findings are encouraging, mainly the reduction in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;smoking rates and screening for certain cancers, but it’s clear urgent efforts are needed to address lagging cervical cancer prevention,” &lt;a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC3HNfgi38fGTAXIc-2FFypHjVBhGPVi-2BkaL7EwbLTO4Y6ebCFJIXAQD1dHT6pr-2F4jw-2FSOeyxwhX9S3KjhfHPBM6dM-3DmFSM_-2BfvDFm8rLlMG3DiFVwLpkkmQZ5tK1QI-2Bs-2FpJe6gRjYIK1XFj6zR1wY-2F1FgAYynw6K4-2Bl7TMadhQ9W-2Bo9QZg2Rj7MXKRbkCN5xWuHUBqrIVNI2alfkNwo317m3FEpNGnhzpUOaRIQ59tQUesFqbY1D-2BJRj2bxu9B9-2F3QX8fO5cS1-2Bpad0GUhRk77nEthdHu6VzRdF46PjrvFK3BctkuEjBW9jaDTcfZcP2MkiZOIIsMQ-2Bl2u74xR8vETSP4gUDkv29IHJ3EZlUIn2id3GsXXmN8Vgc5VG0mgzYTBgezk9ziFq9IWHhW1isSi7ZikIRxWuIyU7HurgR8XxLKertJGACgxlhMC6QbysL0ErkHQbWwA-3D" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Priti Bandi&lt;/a&gt;, scientific director of cancer risk factors and screening surveillance research at the American Cancer Society and lead author of the study, said in a news release.

            The prevalence of people being up-to-date on recommended cervical cancer screenings has dropped from 74.8% in 2019 to 73.4% in 2021 among ages 21 to 65, the report found, leaving more women at risk of not detecting disease early. The reported noted that the decrease is alarming as HPV vaccination rates have remained “statistically unchanged” in recent years. In 2023, 61.4% of adolescents ages 13 to 17 were up-to-date for the HPV vaccination series, similar to 61.7% in 2021 and up from 54.2% in 2019.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            HPV or human papillomavirus is a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/diseases/hpv/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;group of more than 150 viruses&lt;/a&gt; that can cause certain types of cancer. Spread primarily through sexual contact, most cases of HPV clear on their own within two years, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/about/about-genital-hpv-infection.html" target="_blank"&gt;when the infection does not go away&lt;/a&gt;, health problems like cancer may occur – which is why preventing these infections with vaccination has been key.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9txqnrj000a3b6owgzad536@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new report included data on US adults and their modifiable cancer risk factors in the years during and after the Covid-19 pandemic compared with the years prior to the pandemic. The data came from sources at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the CDC’s National Health Interview Survey, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Immunization Survey-Teen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9txqnrj000b3b6oj7ptf6o7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s estimated that nearly half – about 40% – of new cancer cases among US adults ages 30 and older could be attributed to preventable risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, excess body weight, an unhealthy diet, not exercising regularly, ultraviolet radiation exposure and cancer-causing infections like HPV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9txqnrj000c3b6o7g02igrw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Despite historic reductions in smoking levels and improvements in breast and colorectal cancer screenings, including following the COVID-19 pandemic, obesity rates remain high and unchanged, physical activity levels remain suboptimal, and HPV vaccination levels have plateaued since 2021,” the American Cancer Society researchers wrote in the new report. They added that racial disparities in cancer rates and deaths persist as marginalized groups face barriers accessing healthcare.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9txqnrj000d3b6o0sth4nk7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Staying up-to-date on cancer screenings can further prevent thousands of additional cancer cases and deaths, according to the American Cancer Society.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9txqnrj000f3b6opjxvfwbl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A separate report released Monday found that the rate of people dying from cancer has stayed on a steady decline in the US from 2001 through 2022. But when it comes to the rate of people being diagnosed with cancer, the incidence rate among men fell from 2001 through 2013 and then stabilized through 2021, while incidence among women increased slightly every year between 2003 and 2021.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Those trends were interrupted in 2020, when cancer incidence rates fell significantly, possibly because of disruptions in cancer screenings and medical care related to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/report_to_nation/" target="_blank"&gt;Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Cancer. After 2020, they returned to expected levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9txqnrj000h3b6olafenb5h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sustained declines in lung cancer have been a major contributor to the overall improvements in cancer death rates in the US. Fewer people in the US are using tobacco, helping lower incidence and death rates for smoking-related cancers like lung, bladder and larynx, the report said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9txqnrj000i3b6okf7j3j5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, incidence rates are on the rise for several other cancers, including those linked with excess weight, such as pancreas and kidney cancers; uterine, breast and liver cancers among women; and colon and rectal cancers among adolescents and young adults.

In healthy mice, key “hub” molecules like ATP and AMP responded rapidly and in a coordinated sequence to starvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In obese mice, this temporal coordination was lost, even though the molecular network appeared structurally sound. This breakthrough highlights the importance of timing in metabolic regulation and introduces a new method for analyzing biological networks over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporal Breakdown:&lt;/strong&gt; Obese mice show disrupted timing, not structure, in liver metabolism during starvation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hub Molecule Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Healthy livers used ATP/AMP as core regulators; obese livers did not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Method:&lt;/strong&gt; Combines structural and temporal data for deeper insight into metabolism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Tokyo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers led by Keigo Morita and Shinya Kuroda of the University of Tokyo have revealed a temporal disruption in the metabolism of obese mice when adapting to starvation despite no significant structural disruptions in the molecular network. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a breakthrough discovery as research including the temporal dimension in biology has been notoriously laborious and extracting systematic insight from big data has been difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109008"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows the shadow of an obese person and a clock." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In other words, even though the structure of the molecular network during starvation remained robust, it became temporally vulnerable to obesity. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, this study paves the way for further research into more general metabolic processes, such as food intake and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Signaling&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living beings need to continuously extract energy from “food” and distribute it within the body to stay alive, that is keep their metabolisms running so that their bodies are in an optimal range called “homeostatis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starvation is one of the most severe disruptions to this system. When adapting to starvation, the liver, which plays a central role in metabolism, coordinates not just which but also when molecules need to take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Molecules inside cells form a large network,” says Kuroda, the principal investigator, “containing a small number of molecules regulating many metabolic reactions called hub molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, a systematic understanding of the temporal coordination of molecules in the liver had been elusive due to the lack of comprehensive time-series data during starvation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to fill the gap by comparing the livers of healthy and obese mice. Their measures showed a clear difference between the hub molecules of healthy and obese liver cells. The former contained the energy-related molecules ATP and AMP, but the latter did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a clear difference between hub molecules could have structurally disrupted the molecular network. However, the researchers did not find such disruptions, so they investigated the temporal dimension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We comprehensively measured the time courses of various molecules,” says Kuroda, “and found that hub molecules in healthy livers responded to starvation more rapidly than other molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggested a well-controlled temporal order of the molecular networks in healthy livers during starvation. On the other hand, this coordination disappeared in the liver of obese mice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, even though the structure of the molecular network during starvation remained robust, it became temporally vulnerable to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method that led to this discovery, combining structural and temporal analysis of the intracellular molecular network, can be applied to other studies that include data sets from multiple “omes” such as the genome or the microbiome, opening avenues for further research. Kuroda describes their next project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our approach successfully described the global landscape of adaptation to starvation, a complicated biological phenomenon. We would like to generalize our insights of the metabolic network during starvation to the metabolic network during food intake or disease progression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this metabolism and obesity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6200071016034c070f071107220f030b0e4c174f160d091b0d4c03014c0812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emese Berta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://u-tokyo.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Emese Berta – University of Tokyo&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.ads2547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Structural robustness and temporal vulnerability of the starvation-responsive metabolic network in healthy and obese mouse liver&lt;/a&gt;” by Keigo Morita et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Signaling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural robustness and temporal vulnerability of the starvation-responsive metabolic network in healthy and obese mouse liver&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptation to starvation is a multimolecular and temporally ordered process. We sought to elucidate how the healthy liver regulates various molecules in a temporally ordered manner during starvation and how obesity disrupts this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used multiomic data collected from the plasma and livers of wild-type and leptin-deficient obese (&lt;em&gt;ob&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;ob&lt;/em&gt;) mice at multiple time points during starvation to construct a starvation-responsive metabolic network that included responsive molecules and their regulatory relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the network structure showed that in wild-type mice, the key molecules for energy homeostasis, ATP and AMP, acted as hub molecules to regulate various metabolic reactions in the network. Although neither ATP nor AMP was responsive to starvation in &lt;em&gt;ob&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;ob&lt;/em&gt; mice, the structural properties of the network were maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In wild-type mice, the molecules in the network were temporally ordered through metabolic processes coordinated by hub molecules, including ATP and AMP, and were positively or negatively coregulated. By contrast, both temporal order and coregulation were disrupted in &lt;em&gt;ob&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;ob&lt;/em&gt; mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that the metabolic network that responds to starvation was structurally robust but temporally disrupted by the obesity-associated loss of responsiveness of the hub molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, we propose how obesity alters the response to intermittent fasting.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:43:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBWcV85d185M3BrUlhNUDVTR2dVLTEyMEU0NEliaHJrYzVCUV85VHczbDlOX1BLbDFZYnVPa1FDQXIzdVVNSlp0VkFaSTJWTGVRekl5dGxfeWdHNVFQQXgwVFVUcFpwTklGb0JMRkJn</guid></item><item><title>韦伯望远镜正在取得令人难以置信的发现：它可能会变暗- Phys.org | The Webb Telescope is making incredible discoveries: It may go dark - Phys.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPbk5vUmVCanRTX3lCaWo5V2h4bDhiMnpBR19UcWVoU1Fhak1PaWFubEhDNHZyVkFvMllTNFhSMHZNTzU4b1laT1FuUXg4N2hfdDRvTE1mclVHNThhRklTb3ktUEI5TmdyM0tteWktWFVLZGpLYXAtTjUwVjJvODc4UE1TSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The political news these days is enough to make some Chicagoans wish they were a million miles away. But consider this: Even in the depths of space, there's no escape from politics.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope is literally parked 1 million miles away. In the nearly three years since it became operational, "Webb," as it's called, has made some incredible findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webb uses infrared scanning to show how stars and galaxies form, and to study the atmospheres of distant planets. Its capabilities complement the aging Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits Earth at an altitude of only 340 miles or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other discoveries, Webb has uncovered the slow-motion process of a star engulfing a planet and provided data about an asteroid traveling at high speed in our direction (It will miss us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think any U.S. president would view this as an asset. Alas, like so much of the country's ongoing scientific research, Webb is at risk of being defunded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump's administration has removed NASA's top scientist and proposed a nearly 50% budget cut to the agency's Science Mission Directorate, which oversees &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/planetary+science/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;planetary science&lt;/a&gt;, astrophysics research and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House reportedly is pushing to scrap the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, a wide-view instrument undergoing final testing and assembly that is scheduled for launch within two years. Next-generation satellites meant to improve human understanding of the planet are on the chopping block as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While NASA's proposed budget retains some funding for the Hubble and Webb telescopes, they could become practically useless given the cuts planned for the agency's science staff.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Pointing these gadgets at the right targets to obtain useful data is no simple feat. Without a critical mass of scientists, "the science from these instruments stops," Daniel Holz, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago, told us. "It's just not viable if these cuts go through anywhere near what's proposed. There is no bare-bones mode to run these highly complex, state-of-the-art facilities."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration's planned cuts at NASA are being repeated at other agencies employing scientists to do everything from vetting new prescription drugs to predicting hurricane landfalls. Similarly, Trump's pressure campaign on elite universities uses federal research funding as leverage, in some cases threatening to destroy years of work by disrupting long-term studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this page supports fiscal responsibility and eliminating wasteful spending, the latest moves have an ulterior motive. They are aimed at gaining control over institutions likely to push back against Trump's agenda by citing inconvenient truths: Climate change is no hoax, vaccines save millions of lives and sweeping tariffs amount to a huge tax hike on American consumers and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, politics has always influenced federal spending, especially at NASA. Just a few years ago, some on the left protested the telescope, claiming namesake James Webb discriminated against gay people when he headed the space agency in the 1960s. Now advocates on the right appear determined to eliminate climate-related research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Big cuts at NASA would play into the hands of America's rivals across the globe. China and Europe are working aggressively to overtake the American lead in science and technology, and actively recruiting top scientists who feel under siege in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a practical level, attacks on &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/scientific+research/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;scientific research&lt;/a&gt; could undermine the nation's ability to cure diseases, upgrade defense systems, or make computers and phones work better in the future. Critical risks—even world-ending threats—would be more likely to go unmitigated without the science to accurately assess them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with researching &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/gravitational+waves/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gravitational waves&lt;/a&gt;, Holz heads the Science and Security Board at the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists responsible for setting the legendary "Doomsday Clock," which ticks closer to midnight as the risk of Armageddon increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock, based at the University of Chicago, lost much of its relevance when the Cold War ended. Unfortunately, it's relevant again today, and stands at the closest point to doomsday in its 80-year history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Bulletin started, Holz explains, the overriding threat was nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. These days, additional factors push the world closer to the brink. To the extent &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/climate+change/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; leads to mass migration and conflicts over resources, for instance, it makes all-out war more likely. A man-made pandemic or misuse of artificial intelligence could lead to the same outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall, Holz's board decided to move the clock one second closer to midnight, announcing in January that the world was only 89 seconds away. Since then, he said, the group has been following the administration's actions and it's alarmed by the broad and deep attacks on science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board reserves the right to change the clock at any time, Holz said, not just annually. Anyone interested will need to stay tuned, but we're willing to bet that if the clock moves any time soon, it will be moving closer to doomsday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration's planned cuts at NASA are being repeated at other agencies employing scientists to do everything from vetting new prescription drugs to predicting hurricane landfalls. Similarly, Trump's pressure campaign on elite universities uses federal research funding as leverage, in some cases threatening to destroy years of work by disrupting long-term studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this page supports fiscal responsibility and eliminating wasteful spending, the latest moves have an ulterior motive. They are aimed at gaining control over institutions likely to push back against Trump's agenda by citing inconvenient truths: Climate change is no hoax, vaccines save millions of lives and sweeping tariffs amount to a huge tax hike on American consumers and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, politics has always influenced federal spending, especially at NASA. Just a few years ago, some on the left protested the telescope, claiming namesake James Webb discriminated against gay people when he headed the space agency in the 1960s. Now advocates on the right appear determined to eliminate climate-related research.&lt;/p&gt;

																																			&lt;p&gt;Big cuts at NASA would play into the hands of America's rivals across the globe. China and Europe are working aggressively to overtake the American lead in science and technology, and actively recruiting top scientists who feel under siege in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a practical level, attacks on &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/scientific+research/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;scientific research&lt;/a&gt; could undermine the nation's ability to cure diseases, upgrade defense systems, or make computers and phones work better in the future. Critical risks—even world-ending threats—would be more likely to go unmitigated without the science to accurately assess them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with researching &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/gravitational+waves/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gravitational waves&lt;/a&gt;, Holz heads the Science and Security Board at the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists responsible for setting the legendary "Doomsday Clock," which ticks closer to midnight as the risk of Armageddon increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock, based at the University of Chicago, lost much of its relevance when the Cold War ended. Unfortunately, it's relevant again today, and stands at the closest point to doomsday in its 80-year history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Bulletin started, Holz explains, the overriding threat was nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. These days, additional factors push the world closer to the brink. To the extent &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/climate+change/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; leads to mass migration and conflicts over resources, for instance, it makes all-out war more likely. A man-made pandemic or misuse of artificial intelligence could lead to the same outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall, Holz's board decided to move the clock one second closer to midnight, announcing in January that the world was only 89 seconds away. Since then, he said, the group has been following the administration's actions and it's alarmed by the broad and deep attacks on science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board reserves the right to change the clock at any time, Holz said, not just annually. Anyone interested will need to stay tuned, but we're willing to bet that if the clock moves any time soon, it will be moving closer to doomsday.&lt;/p&gt;

Using wearable devices and brain imaging from over 4,000 participants, researchers discovered that even small differences in sleep duration and timing impacted brain volume and task performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teens with the earliest bedtimes had the healthiest sleep patterns, the largest brain volumes, and performed best on memory, vocabulary, and focus tasks. Despite the benefits, no group consistently met the recommended 8–10 hours of sleep, highlighting a broader sleep deficit during this critical developmental stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Teens who went to bed earlier had larger brain volume and better cognitive performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small Differences, Big Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Just 15 minutes more sleep made measurable differences in brain health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under-Sleeping Trend:&lt;/strong&gt; None of the adolescent groups met recommended sleep duration guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adolescents who sleep for longer – and from an earlier bedtime – than their peers tend to have improved brain function and perform better at cognitive tests, researchers from the UK and China have shown.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study of adolescents in the US also showed that even those with better sleeping habits were not reaching the amount of sleep recommended for their age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep plays an important role in helping our bodies function. It is thought that while we are asleep, toxins that have built up in our brains are cleared out, and brain connections are consolidated and pruned, enhancing memory, learning, and problem-solving skills. Sleep has also been shown to boost our immune systems and improve our mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During adolescence, our sleep patterns change. We tend to start going to bed later and sleeping less, which affects our body clocks. All of this coincides with a period of important development in our brain function and cognitive development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Sleep Medicine says that the ideal amount of sleep during this period is between eight- and 10-hours’ sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Barbara Sahakian from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge said: “Regularly getting a good night’s sleep is important in helping us function properly, but while we know a lot about sleep in adulthood and later life, we know surprisingly little about sleep in adolescence, even though this is a crucial time in our development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How long do young people sleep for, for example, and what impact does this have on their brain function and cognitive performance?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies looking at how much sleep adolescents get usually rely on self-reporting, which can be inaccurate. To get around this, a team led by researchers at Fudan University, Shanghai, and the University of Cambridge turned to data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the ABCD Study, more than 3,200 adolescents aged 11-12 years old had been given FitBits, allowing the researchers to look at objective data on their sleep patterns and to compare it against brain scans and results from cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team double-checked their results against two additional groups of 13-14 years old, totalling around 1,190 participants. The results are published today in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that the adolescents could be divided broadly into one of three groups:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group One, accounting for around 39% of participants, slept an average (mean) of 7 hours 10 mins. They tended to go to bed and fall asleep the latest and wake up the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group Two, accounting for 24% of participants, slept an average of 7 hours 21 mins. They had average levels across all sleep characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group Three, accounting for 37% of participants, slept an average of 7 hours 25 mins. They tended to go to bed and fall asleep the earliest and had lower heart rates during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the researchers found no significant differences in school achievement between the groups, when it came to cognitive tests looking at aspects such as vocabulary, reading, problem solving and focus, Group Three performed better than Group Two, which in turn performed better than Group One.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group Three also had the largest brain volume and best brain functions, with Group One the smallest volume and poorest brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Sahakian said: “Even though the differences in the amount of sleep that each group got was relatively small, at just over a quarter-of-an-hour between the best and worst sleepers, we could still see differences in brain structure and activity and in how well they did at tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This drives home to us just how important it is to have a good night’s sleep at this important time in life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First author Dr Qing Ma from Fudan University said: “Although our study can’t answer conclusively whether young people have better brain function and perform better at tests &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they sleep better, there are a number of studies that would support this idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, research has shown the benefits of sleep on memory, especially on memory consolidation, which is important for learning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also assessed the participants’ heart rates, finding that Group Three had the lowest heart rates across the sleep states and Group One the highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower heart rates are usually a sign of better health, whereas higher rates often accompany poor sleep quality like restless sleep, frequent awakenings and excessive daytime sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the ABCD Study is a longitudinal study – that is, one that follows its participants over time – the team was able to show that the differences in sleep patterns, brain structure and function, and cognitive performance, tended be present two years before and two years after the snapshot that they looked at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author Dr Wei Cheng from Fudan University added: “Given the importance of sleep, we now need to look at why some children go to bed later and sleep less than others. Is it because of playing videogames or smartphones, for example, or is just that their body clocks do not tell them it’s time to sleep until later?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by the National Key R&amp;amp;D Program of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China, National Postdoctoral Foundation of China and Shanghai Postdoctoral Excellence Program. The ABCD Study is supported by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep, cognition, and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f19283909896df93839894839d9488b190959c989fdf92909cdf9092df849a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Craig Brierley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cam.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Craig Brierley – University of Cambridge&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neural correlates of device-based sleep characteristics in adolescents&lt;/a&gt;” by Barbara Sahakian et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural correlates of device-based sleep characteristics in adolescents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the brain mechanisms underlying adolescent sleep patterns and their impact on psychophysiological development is complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We applied sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA) to data from 3,222 adolescents in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, integrating sleep characteristics with multimodal imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reveals two key sleep-brain dimensions: one linking later sleep onset and shorter duration to decreased subcortical-cortical connectivity and another associating a higher heart rate and shorter light sleep with lower brain volumes and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical clustering identifies three biotypes: biotype 1 has delayed, shorter sleep with a higher heart rate; biotype 3 has earlier, longer sleep with a lower heart rate; and biotype 2 is intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These biotypes also differ in cognitive performance and brain structure and function. Longitudinal analysis confirms these differences from ages 9 to 14, with biotype 3 showing consistent cognitive advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings offer insights into optimizing sleep routines for better cognitive development.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:16:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE1Wa2hVTDNnV2N4LUVFMjJHVWVZOFJFOENjdE1vMXp1czV2eVQ2MklRM1RuRnZsdHdieEFzWlJwMVY3XzhFanNzZUJ4bTNqTjIxRFJBUFF2MzNSdDlEOEtnZkZ0dmxOTmZqeWUtMFYyRDd6ejdJTGlF</guid></item><item><title>新的研究有助于解释年轻人不明原因的中风-《西雅图时报》 | New research helps explain unexplained strokes in younger adults - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxNWVpFaGpOWkJFYWtNY081Q08wS1pEbG15VFNqUnJLcjNRekZ1MHQ1dzJhOUY1UFpaSW52aFdad0poV00xU2JsczQyVV9IcGJxNzFKekMwNGZFY1Y1a3c2TWlVZ0gtUlZiZ3F6d2t1dTZxRHd6UmJFT0VReW9mWmVPWWJKVl9UdTFqU0xtaXVGaFlZOF9OVnN4SFExODFnQXhza0VrbF9OTUxBQzFRLWFUU2M4cU4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-content" class="article-content entry-content"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In adults under age 50, strokes caused by clots are on the rise — and many happen without a clear link to a traditional cause such as high blood pressure. A new study suggests the underlying reason for these unexplained, or cryptogenic, strokes could hinge in part on whether someone has a type of hole between the upper chambers of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.124.049855" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; show that cryptogenic strokes in participants with a patent foramen ovale, or PFO, were much more often caused by risk factors considered nontraditional, such as a history of chronic kidney disease, cancer or blood clots in veins, than what was seen in stroke survivors without a PFO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But overall, migraine with aura, or sensory disturbances such as flashes of light, was the leading nontraditional cause linked to cryptogenic strokes, especially among women and people with a PFO. Although typically harmless, a PFO can increase stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the American Heart Association journal Stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised by the role of nontraditional risk factors, especially migraine headaches, which seems to be one of the leading risk factors in the development of strokes in younger adults,” lead researcher Dr. Jukka Putaala said in a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/nontraditional-risk-factors-shed-light-on-unexplained-strokes-in-adults-younger-than-50" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While traditional risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol, “our results should inform the health professional community to develop a more tailored approach to risk factor assessment and management,” said Putaala, head of the stroke unit at the Neurocenter at Helsinki University Hospital in Finland. “We should be especially asking young women if they have a history of migraine headaches and about other nontraditional risk factors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research also found that risk factors specific to women, such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia or other pregnancy complications, were more common in women who’d had a stroke, regardless of whether they had a PFO, than in women who’d never had a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed health data from 523 adults ages 18-49 with and without a PFO who’d had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke and compared them with 523 people of similar ages but no history of stroke. The data came from the Searching for Explanations for Cryptogenic Stroke in the Young: Revealing the Triggers, Causes, and Outcome, or SECRETO, study. Participants were enrolled at 19 health centers across 13 European countries from late 2013 until early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked for links between participants’ strokes and 12 traditional and 10 nontraditional risk factors, as well as five risk factors specific to women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stroke survivors with a PFO — after accounting for factors such as age, sex and level of education — the study found that each additional nontraditional risk factor more than doubled the odds of an ischemic stroke. In those without a PFO, each nontraditional risk factor increased the odds by 70%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers noted that the findings do not show cause and effect because of the observational nature of the study, meaning it was a review and analysis of existing data. Also, because 95% of the participants were white adults of European descent, it’s unknown whether the findings would apply to other populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s breakdown of data by participants’ sex and age is helpful because stroke risk changes accordingly, Dr. Tracy E. Madsen said in the news release. Madsen, who was not involved in the new study, is vice chair of research in emergency medicine and director of the EpiCenter at the University of Vermont’s Larner College of Medicine in Burlington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For instance, recent data shows that younger women may have a higher risk of stroke than younger men. However, during middle age, men usually have a higher risk,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madsen said that recognizing specific risks that affect women and that are not commonly seen, such as pregnancy complications and migraine with aura, “could change our approach to screening for these risks and educating our patients throughout their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putaala noted that as many as half of all ischemic strokes in younger adults are cryptogenic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For effective prevention, careful and routine assessment of both traditional and nontraditional risk factors in younger people is critical,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

By comparing the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64364908/muscle-activation-technique/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64364908/muscle-activation-technique/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="most active" data-node-id="5.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;most active&lt;/a&gt; participants to those with the least amount of physical activity, scientists found that &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64538249/walking-aging-longevity-11-minutes/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64538249/walking-aging-longevity-11-minutes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="life expectancy" data-node-id="5.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; was positively correlated with exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If the least active 25 percent of Americans matched the top quarter, they would need to add about 111 minutes of daily walking (or an equivalent activity) to their routine. But the rewards were significant: It could, in theory, increase their lifespans by up to 11 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The perks weren't as big for already-active participants, but still notable: Those in the second-lowest activity group who walked about 83 extra minutes a day could add 4.6 years to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-walking-add-11-years-to-my-life" data-node-id="9" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="9.0"&gt;Can walking add 11 years to my life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;It's tough to say—this is just one study and it only tracked the activity of people over four days. Also, there are a lot of factors that go into how long you live, making it difficult to pin it all on one thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;That said, there does seem to be a connection between moving more and longevity.

Within a day of injury, beneficial bacteria plummet, harmful microbes rise, and levels of butyrate—a key anti-inflammatory compound—drop significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This microbial chaos fuels immune overactivation, as fecal matter from injured subjects triggered high inflammatory responses in intestinal cells. Encouragingly, pre-treatment with butyrate reduced this inflammation, pointing to a potential therapeutic path for patients suffering from alcohol-related trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbial Breakdown:&lt;/strong&gt; Alcohol and burns together deplete good gut bacteria and SCFAs like butyrate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation Spike:&lt;/strong&gt; Post-injury gut samples triggered strong immune responses in lab tests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Hope:&lt;/strong&gt; Butyrate supplementation blunted inflammation, suggesting a new treatment angle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Loyola University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens in your gut after a night of heavy drinking and a severe burn injury? According to a new study, it might involve more than just pain and discomfort. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Loyola University Chicago Health Sciences Division have shown that alcohol combined with burn trauma throws the intestinal microbiome into chaos, leading to inflammation and impaired gut barrier function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108998"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows the gut." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Previous work has shown that alcohol can slow down intestinal motility and damage the gut lining. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work uncovers the microbial shifts and metabolic fallout of these injuries, highlighting a potential path forward: replenishing lost microbial metabolites might help protect the gut—and the rest of the body—after trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burn injuries on their own are already a serious challenge, but when alcohol intoxication is involved, outcomes become significantly worse. Patients admitted to the hospital with both conditions have higher rates of sepsis and mortality than those with burns alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous work has shown that alcohol can slow down intestinal motility and damage the gut lining. Combined with the physiological stress of a burn, this leads to a breakdown in the gut barrier, allowing bacteria and their inflammatory byproducts to leak into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found major disruptions in the gut microbiome one day after alcohol and burn injury. Bacterial diversity dropped significantly, especially in the small intestine. Beneficial microbes were depleted, while populations of Proteobacteria—a group that includes many potentially harmful species—surged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These microbial shifts were accompanied by a drop in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly butyrate. SCFAs are crucial compounds produced by gut bacteria. They nourish intestinal cells, help maintain the integrity of the gut lining and regulate inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Butyrate serves as a primary energy source for intestinal epithelial cells and is known to promote anti-inflammatory responses. In alcohol and burn injury, butyrate levels were significantly lower than in healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine whether this imbalance had functional consequences, the researchers took fecal samples from the injured host and exposed them to intestinal cells in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking: fecal matter from the injured group triggered much higher levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, in the intestinal cells compared to samples from uninjured host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This inflammatory response was strongly correlated with the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, a bacterial family that had flourished after the injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouragingly, when the researchers pre-treated the cells with butyrate, the IL-6 response was blunted. This suggests that the lack of butyrate in the injured gut plays a direct role in amplifying inflammation. Butyrate fuels intestinal cells and seems to keep inflammatory responses in check, acting as a kind of microbial brake on the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these findings were observed in an experimental model, the implications for human health are compelling. Many burn patients arrive at the hospital with alcohol in their systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how these conditions interact to harm the gut could help explain why such patients fare worse. If similar disruptions in the microbiome and SCFAs occur in patients, restoring those microbial metabolites could become a new therapeutic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the importance of timing. The microbial changes and inflammation were observed just one day after injury, emphasizing how quickly the gut environment can shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This underscores the need for rapid interventions after trauma—perhaps through SCFA supplementation, prebiotics that encourage the growth of SCFA-producing bacteria, or targeted probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that future studies will need to explore whether boosting butyrate levels &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; can reduce inflammation and improve outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also point out that standard post-burn care does not currently address the intestines or gut microbiome, overlooking an organ system that could offer therapeutic opportunities for burn victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the gut microbiome has gained attention in recent years for its role in everything from obesity to mental health, this research adds a new layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the context of acute trauma, microbial health might influence recovery and resilience. If so, protecting and restoring the gut could become a key pillar of post-injury care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this alcohol use and microbiome research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#97faf4fff8e2f3ffe5eed7fbe2f4b9f2f3e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mashkoor A.

We sought to characterise changes in the intestinal microbiome and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) following alcohol intoxication and burn injury and to determine whether these changes are associated with intestinal inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-4"&gt;10–12-week-old C57BL/6 male and female mice were subjected to ethanol intoxication and a 12.5% total body surface area scald burn injury.

EB faeces were marked by increased Proteobacteria and many pathobionts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-5"&gt;EB caecum faeces exhibited a significant decrease in butyrate and a downward trend in acetate and total SCFAs. SCFA changes correlated with microbial changes particularly in the SI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-5"&gt;Treatment of murine duodenal cell clone-K (MODE-K) cells with faecal slurries led to upregulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) from EB faeces compared with SV faeces which correlated with levels of Enterobacteriaceae.

A new study shows that contingent responsive parenting—caregivers who accurately respond to a baby’s cues—can reshape early brain activity in ways that support emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infants who received this kind of caregiving showed calmer reactions to fear and more empathy, while those who didn’t showed brain patterns linked to emotional difficulties. The findings suggest that early, attuned parenting can be a powerful protective factor, especially for high-reactivity babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperament Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; 20% of infants have a temperament linked to later emotional challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Change:&lt;/strong&gt; Responsive parenting reshapes infants’ brain activity to support regulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Outcome:&lt;/strong&gt; These babies show calmer reactions and early signs of empathy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Reichman University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approximately 20% of babies are born with a turbulent and unregulated temperament, characterized by high sensitivity to new stimuli, a tendency to cry excessively, and difficulty calming down once emotionally aroused. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have identified this temperament as a potential risk factor for challenges in social-emotional development, particularly for the emergence of anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study found that contingent responsive parenting — that is, consistently and accurately responding to the baby’s cues and rhythms — can shape patterns of brain activity in ways that strengthen the child’s capacity for emotional regulation and reduce the likelihood of developing emotional difficulties later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers followed 51 mother-infant pairs over the course of the babies’ first year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At four months of age, observations were conducted to assess the infants’ temperament and to evaluate the degree of contingent responsiveness in the mothers’ interactions —how accurately and sensitively they responded to their babies’ cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one year of age, the researchers measured the infants’ brain activity using EEG and examined their reactions to fear and to witnessing others in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings show that early parenting influences the baby’s brain activity, which in turn supports their emotional and social behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infants with turbulent temperaments who did not experience parental contingent responsiveness developed a pattern of brain activity associated with emotional regulation difficulties, and showed heightened fear in unfamiliar situations and less prosocial behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, babies with similar temperaments who received contingent responsive parenting did not develop the brain activity associated with emotional difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, their brain activity supported more adaptive behavior: they responded more calmly to fearful situations and even demonstrated the beginnings of empathy and prosocial behavior in response to the pain of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tahli Frenkel, Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology, Reichman University: “These findings highlight the critical role of early parenting as a protective factor, especially for infants with more reactive or sensitive temperaments. Such temperaments can be very difficult for both the baby and the parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study’s findings are encouraging, as they indicate that challenging temperaments can be shaped with the help of an responsive caregiving environment. Babies with more intense temperaments need an environment that helps them regulate their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When parents are attuned to the baby’s rhythm, and especially to signals indicating whether the baby is ready to tolerate new stimuli from the environment, they support the development of emotional regulation and build resilience that will help the child cope with the challenges posed by his or her innate temperament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Raising awareness among parents, offering them emotional support, and providing them with the knowledge and tools to deal with the natural challenges involved in parenting a baby with a turbulent temperament can have significant and long-term effects on the parenting experience, on the child, and on the parent-child relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Developmental Psychology&lt;/em&gt; as part of a special issue in memory of Jerome Kagan, a pioneer in the study of infant temperament, reinforces the importance of early emotional connections in shaping a healthy developmental trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greater awareness, early detection, and tailored interventions have the potential to make a significant and lasting impact on children’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this parenting and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7c1015081d10521e19121d0e153c15181f521d1f521510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lital Ben Ari&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://idc.ac.il" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reichman University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lital Ben Ari – Reichman University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001764" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Maternal Contingent Responsiveness Moderates Temperamental Risk to Support Adaptive Infant Brain and Socioemotional Development Across the First Year of Life&lt;/a&gt;” by Tahli Frenkel et al. &lt;em&gt;Developmental Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maternal Contingent Responsiveness Moderates Temperamental Risk to Support Adaptive Infant Brain and Socioemotional Development Across the First Year of Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first few months of life, infants display intriguing individual differences in how they react to novel stimuli in their environment. Infant “negative reactive” tendencies have been robustly linked to resting brain activity profiles that confer risk for maladaptive socioemotional outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present study examines whether and how caregiver behavior in early infancy may interact with infant negative reactivity to alter the extent to which such tendencies predict risk-related brain activity profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present study, 51 mothers (all White; age &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; = 32 years, &lt;em&gt;SD&lt;/em&gt; = 3; 70.8% monthly household income &amp;gt; 3,400 U.S. dollars) and their infants (39.2% female at birth) participated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We measured infant negative reactivity and maternal contingent responsiveness to infant’s gaze during mother–infant interactions at age 4 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 10–11 months, we assessed infants’ resting electroencephalographic (EEG) 6–9 Hz frontal asymmetry (a marker of risk for maladaptive regulatory behaviors and withdrawal), infant fearful withdrawal, and infant empathic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that maternal contingent responsiveness to 4-month-old infant’s gaze in naturalistic interactions moderated the relation between 4-month infant negative reactivity and 11-month resting EEG asymmetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results suggest that maternal contingent responsiveness alters the extent to which early reactive tendencies end up “embedded” in infant brain activity profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploratory analyses revealed that the interaction between maternal contingent responsiveness and infant reactivity predicting infant resting EEG asymmetry, in turn predicted infants’ fearful withdrawal and empathic behaviors also assessed at 10–11 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings demonstrate the critical buffering role of maternal contingent responsive behaviors in reducing potential maladaptive neural and socioemotional outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:27:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPRklFQkxoR2xTMUZNU2VHVE41MHlJTnQ4ckhvOVJLWGIwOGdZNXUxRFRONTRBMEhsMGVMN3IzOFotSElrSEFVMmczRTVNcTJvODR3Y25KVkJaTlRIeDhCWmUycU1GSVJnN3Z5dkJIUXM4QllKbXNUNVpseGdvY0VHeEE5S0NBUkZK</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic的残酷而模糊的副作用，模拟显示它实际上对您的身体有什么影响- UNILAD | Brutal obscure side effect of Ozempic revealed as simulation shows what it actually does to your body - UNILAD</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNaXliRV9DVTV4SGRxazBFQUJpSmFtVms2SEFvUFFSVUZFOGUzTy1nMldpcDU2Ni1aZlhMY1FzNlRqelJ2S0RUeUpkMmdCbG1UanBJR2RvUlpKNmVwM2tIX0lGRDItYzBObXQwRy16NUFFNElRYTMxMmZtWjdlMmtvVFJjR051RTI1aGVNMkdFX05UQVYwdGRWSWJIc1hNSTR2djdj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More information about the side effects of medications being used for weight loss, like Ozempic, are coming to light.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It's said that one in eight Americans have tried GLP-1 drugs like &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/ozempic"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; - a type of medication aimed at helping those with &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/news/health/five-signs-common-condition-americans-unknown-013192-20241004"&gt;Type 2 Diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While Ozempic is cleared by the FDA to help with diabetes, it has not has not been approved as a weight loss option, as the FDA have not studied the drug for weight loss and management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Similar GLP-1 drugs such as semaglutide (Wegovy) and liraglutide (Saxenda) have been approved by the FDA to help treat obesity, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Ozempic might not have been cleared as a medication to take for weight loss alone, but some doctors are still prescribing it 'off-label' to patients without diabetes.

in 2025 and one million per year by 2060.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean people are powerless in reducing their risk, however, according to Dr. Joel Salinas, a behavioral neurologist and associate professor at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/blood-pressure-dementia-risk-share-surprising-link-study-suggests" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Blood Pressure And Dementia Risk Share Surprising Link, Study Suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Blood Pressure And Dementia Risk Share Surprising Link, Study Suggests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salinas joined Fox News Digital in an on-camera interview to discuss what’s driving the spike in dementia cases and what behavioral changes could provide some degree of cognitive protection. &lt;strong&gt;(See the video at the top of the article.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest factors in the increase is demographics, noted Salinas, who is also the co-founder and chief medical officer of Isaac Health, a virtual memory clinic for brain health and memory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Dementia cases continue to rise in the U.S., with people over age 55 facing a 42% risk of developing the condition in their lifetime.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The baby boomer population, being one of the largest groups, is also the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fastest-aging group;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fastest-aging group&lt;/a&gt;," he told Fox News Digital. "As we get more and more baby boomers — not just over 65, but into their 70s and 80s — we're going to see more and more of them developing some degree of cognitive impairment due to a plethora of reasons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age is indeed the biggest risk factor, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After age 65, our risk starts to increase. By the time we get to our 80s, that risk is about one in three," he said. "And then after 85, it starts to go up even higher, to almost one in two."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic could have played a role as well, the neurologist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is still being understood, but it seems like &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Covid-19;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; also affected blood vessels in the body and the brain," he said. "So people who already had a vulnerability for developing dementia could have had an acceleration or an earlier presentation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/stroke-dementia-depression-share-17-preventable-risk-factors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stroke, Dementia And Depression Share These 17 Preventable Risk Factors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stroke, Dementia And Depression Share These 17 Preventable Risk Factors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has also shown that loneliness and social isolation can increase one’s risk of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cognitive decline;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that individuals who don't have a lot of social engagement are at a higher risk," Salinas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A recent study led by Johns Hopkins predicted half a million dementia cases in 2025 and one million per year by 2060.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's still a lot being done to figure out, you know, the chicken or the egg — is it that you're developing the disease and you're presenting with symptoms of loneliness earlier than others, or is it the loneliness and social isolation that increases your risk? I think it's probably both."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a genetic component of dementia, the neurologist said, but the good news is that it’s rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/smartphone-use-could-reduce-dementia-risk-older-adults-study-finds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Smartphone Use Could Reduce Dementia Risk In Older Adults, Study Finds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Smartphone Use Could Reduce Dementia Risk In Older Adults, Study Finds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you think about risks and protective factors like a seesaw, these rare &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/genetics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:genetic mutations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;genetic mutations&lt;/a&gt; may outweigh anything protective you do, but the nice thing is that because they're rare, the chances are you don't have those risks," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So you probably have genetic risk that can be outweighed to some degree by protective factors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major study published last year in The Lancet found that almost half of dementia cases are potentially preventable with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lifestyle modifications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lifestyle modifications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many different factors to address, Salinas said, with proper nutrition and exercise topping the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;"Obstructive sleep apnea, which is a common sleep disorder, affects blood pressure, heart disease and brain health," the neurologist said.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing hearing loss by using a hearing aid can also help keep dementia at bay, according to the neurologist, as can staying socially engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health/stop-smoking" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Quitting smoking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Quitting smoking&lt;/a&gt; and limiting alcohol consumption can also boost prevention, as does getting enough quality sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/dementia-risk-could-lowered-doing-5-minutes-day-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Health Boost And Dementia Prevention In Just 5 Minutes A Day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Health Boost And Dementia Prevention In Just 5 Minutes A Day&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entering a specific stage of sleep called "slow wave" or "stage three" helps to clear out the buildup of toxic proteins in the brain, Salinas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If someone is having &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:issues with sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;issues with sleep&lt;/a&gt;, we send them to see a sleep specialist to do the proper testing," he said.

  &lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span class="tag-term"&gt;News Release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2025-04-23T08:00:00-04:00" class="date-display-single"&gt;Wednesday, April 23, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;NIH researchers supercharge ordinary clinical device to get a better look at the back of the eye&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
New technique brings retina into sharper focus

.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have leveraged artificial intelligence to transform a device designed to see tissues in the back of the eye into one sharp enough to make out individual cells. The technique provides imaging resolution that rivals the most advanced devices available and is cheaper, faster, and doesn’t require specialized equipment or expertise. The strategy has implications for early detection of disease and for the monitoring of treatment response by making what was once invisible now visible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“AI potentially puts next-generation imaging in the hands of standard eye clinics. It’s like adding a high-resolution lens to a basic camera.” said Johnny Tam, Ph.D., investigator at NIH’s National Eye Institute and senior author of the study report, which published in &lt;em&gt;Communications Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imaging devices, known as ophthalmoscopes, are widely used to examine the light-sensing retina in the back of the eye. A scanning laser ophthalmoscope is standard in eye clinics, but its resolution can only make out structures at the tissue level—things such as lesions, blood vessels, and the optic nerve head. Next-generation ophthalmoscopes enabled with adaptive optics—a technology that compensates for light distortion—can make out cellular features, providing greater diagnostic information. However, adaptive optics-enabled imaging is still in the experimental phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tam and collaborators developed a custom AI system to digitally enhance images of a layer of tissue beneath the light-sensing photoreceptors, known as the retina’s pigmented epithelium (RPE). The first step was to teach the system to recognize image quality as poor, moderate, or good. The researchers did this by feeding the system more than 1,400 images from different areas of the retina, obtained using adaptive-optics ophthalmoscopy. Next, they fed the system corresponding images from the same retinal locations but obtained using standard ophthalmoscopy. An image sharpness test showed that AI improved clarity eightfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our system used what it learned from rating the images obtained from adaptive optics to digitally enhance images obtained with standard ophthalmoscopy,” said Tam. “It’s important to point out that the system is not creating something from nothing. Features that we see in RPE cells with standard imaging are there, they’re just unclear.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These techniques involve injection of a dye called indocyanine green (ICG) into the bloodstream to increase contrast of anatomical features. In the eye clinic, ICG is usually used to image the blood vessels of the eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our ICG imaging strategy allows RPE cells to be quickly and routinely assessed in the clinic,” said Joanne Li, Ph.D., first author of the report and a biomedical engineer in Tam’s lab. “With AI, high quality images of the RPE cells can be obtained in a matter of seconds, using standard clinical imaging instruments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RPE cells’ function is to nourish and support photoreceptors. A variety of blinding conditions first affect RPE cells, including age-related macular degeneration, vitelliform macular dystrophy, and Stargardt disease. However, RPE cells cannot be easily imaged in the clinic. AI-enhanced ICG ophthalmoscopy puts RPE imaging within reach of the typical eye clinic.##&lt;/p&gt;

GLP-1 would also make an excellent name for Musk’s next child since Æ A-Xii has already been used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Lisa Oldson, an obesity medicine specialist, told &lt;i&gt;The Swamp&lt;/i&gt; she is doubtful a diet change alone could account for Trump’s distinctly slimmer look. “Most people don’t lose [weight] that fast without meds,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The doctor explained Trump “looks like he’s lost more than 5-6 percent” of his weight, which is what she would expect the typical person to drop from “just lifestyle modification alone” over the course of a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item b-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="This was a slimmer line Trump at the White house Easter Egg Roll, where he studiously avoided all snacks." class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/BGSCKTVHTVAL7AVPVIYFBHGGMA.JPG?auth=0cbd289667a860e9343b69755b00ef65c737f143dd9b2b0e8ecf0af124f4d7bb&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=592" srcset="https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/BGSCKTVHTVAL7AVPVIYFBHGGMA.JPG?auth=0cbd289667a860e9343b69755b00ef65c737f143dd9b2b0e8ecf0af124f4d7bb&amp;amp;width=274&amp;amp;height=202 274w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/BGSCKTVHTVAL7AVPVIYFBHGGMA.JPG?auth=0cbd289667a860e9343b69755b00ef65c737f143dd9b2b0e8ecf0af124f4d7bb&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=296 400w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/BGSCKTVHTVAL7AVPVIYFBHGGMA.JPG?auth=0cbd289667a860e9343b69755b00ef65c737f143dd9b2b0e8ecf0af124f4d7bb&amp;amp;width=768&amp;amp;height=568 768w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/BGSCKTVHTVAL7AVPVIYFBHGGMA.JPG?auth=0cbd289667a860e9343b69755b00ef65c737f143dd9b2b0e8ecf0af124f4d7bb&amp;amp;width=1024&amp;amp;height=757 1024w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/BGSCKTVHTVAL7AVPVIYFBHGGMA.JPG?auth=0cbd289667a860e9343b69755b00ef65c737f143dd9b2b0e8ecf0af124f4d7bb&amp;amp;width=1440&amp;amp;height=1065 1440w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;This was a slimmer line Trump at the White house Easter Egg Roll, where he studiously avoided all snacks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;Ken Cedeno/REUTERS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“When we look at people losing 30 pounds, 40 pounds, 50 pounds, 80 pounds, 100 pounds,” Oldson said, “that’s much more often due to the newer meds, the GLP agonists,” and not because of diet and exercise alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Carolyn Williams, a&lt;a href="https://www.carolynwilliamsrd.com/about" rel=""&gt; dietitian based in Tuscaloosa, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, said it’s possible Trump’s weight loss is a result of GLP-1 receptor agonists. However, she said those drugs can “make you feel bad,” and Trump appears to be happy and healthy on camera. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Press Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/karoline-leavitt/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/karoline-leavitt"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karoline Leavitt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has no doubts about what’s behind the big trim. “As the results of his recently conducted physical concluded, President Trump is indeed in peak physical and mental condition as a result of his strenuous schedule working 20 hours per day, his exercise on the golf course, and his diet courtesy of the exceptional White House chefs,” she told &lt;i&gt;The Swamp&lt;/i&gt;. “The President is in a physical condition that most men his age could only dream about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Certainly, the billionaire president would have no problem paying the $1,200 a month for the get-slim-quick medication. But earlier this month, he scrapped &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/joe-biden/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/joe-biden"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s plan to cover the “obesity drug” under Medicare. It wasn’t such a great surprise. The proposal would have increased federal spending by about $35 billion at a time when Trump’s DOGE is desperate to show it is cutting costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services did leave itself a loophole, saying it may take another look in the future, and its newly sworn-in boss &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/dr-oz/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/dr-oz"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr Mehmet Oz&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has pitched weight-loss products on his show. Sure, the green coffee extract that Dr. Oz called&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/dr-mehmet-oz-health-claims-controversial-medicare-trump-rcna181085" rel=""&gt; “a miracle pill”&lt;/a&gt; failed to prove effective in a lab, and the original research paper had to be retracted due to invalid data. It’s also worth noting that Dr. Oz shot to TV fame thanks to &lt;b&gt;Oprah Winfrey,&lt;/b&gt; who was a big fan. She’s also a big fan of GLP-1 agonists and credits them with her recent weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item b-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="Donald Trump gestures with open hands and what appears to be a sneering expression.

From &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/274844/southern-style-oven-fried-chicken/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:crispy fried chicken;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;crispy fried chicken&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sheet-pan-balsamic-chicken-asparagus-8780757" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:grilled breast fillets;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;grilled breast fillets&lt;/a&gt; atop Caesar salads, it's hard to deny its universal appeal. After all, it's versatile, relatively affordable and often regarded as a healthier protein option compared to red meat. Chances are, if you're reading this, you’ve probably got some chicken in your fridge right now, just waiting to shine as the star of your next meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s almost impressive how much chicken many people eat, with rates continuing to grow. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025 (DGA), consider poultry to include all kinds of chicken, turkey, duck, geese and even game birds like quail and pheasant. These guidelines recommend eating around 100 grams of poultry as a standard portion, suggesting it be included in meals about one to three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before you start seasoning that drumstick, you might want to hear about this new study. According to some preliminary research published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;, our love affair with chicken may come with a side of unexpected risks—specifically an increased risk of early death from certain gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, you read that right. Put down the poultry seasoning for a moment, because it’s time to dig into what this study says and unravel whether your favorite chicken dish is as innocent as it seems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cholesterol-dementia-risk-study-11709528" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dementia Risk May Be Lowered by 26% by Improving Cholesterol, New Study Says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dementia Risk May Be Lowered by 26% by Improving Cholesterol, New Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Was This Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although some expert panels, like the International Agency for Research on Cancer, suggests red and processed meats may be linked to negative health outcomes, research on poultry is limited, with only a few studies suggesting it might have a role in lowering the risk of death from all causes. &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; To bridge this gap, researchers evaluated the association between white meat consumption and early death from all causes and from gastrointestinal cancers, focusing on the effects of poultry consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on groups of people who were carefully chosen to understand health and lifestyle patterns. Over 4,000 participants contributed key information through interviews conducted by medical staff. These interviews collected details about their demographic background, general health, lifestyle habits and personal history. Measurements of weight and height were taken, and blood pressure readings adhered to international standards. On average, the researchers followed up with the participants over 19 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To analyze dietary habits, participants completed a validated questionnaire designed to reflect typical food consumption. Included was how much meat participants ate, dividing the consumption into red meat, poultry and total meat, sorted into four intake levels per type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their health status, including whether they were alive, had moved away or had died, was confirmed using local municipal records and a regional database. By analyzing these groups, the researchers aimed to understand how meat consumption might be linked to mortality. Advanced statistical methods were used to adjust for factors like age, sex and health conditions, ensuring the results were as accurate and reliable as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bone-health-mediterranean-diet-11711574" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientists Just Discovered a Huge Health Benefit of the Mediterranean Diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scientists Just Discovered a Huge Health Benefit of the Mediterranean Diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Did The Study Find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to meat consumption, participants who died due to complications with gastrointestinal cancers tended to eat the most meat weekly compared to those who died from other causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating more than 300 grams of poultry weekly was linked to a 27% higher risk of death&lt;/strong&gt; compared to eating less than 100 grams, with the risk becoming higher as the amount consumed increased. The risk increased progressively as the portion consumed increased and was greater when compared to the same portion of red meat. Male participants who ate more than 300 grams of poultry weekly had more than double the risk of dying from gastrointestinal cancer compared to those who ate less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all 1,028 subjects who died, red meat made up about 59% of their weekly meat intake, with white meat accounting for roughly 41%—29% of that was poultry. Participants overall followed the Mediterranean diet reasonably well, which remained consistent across different causes of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/colon-cancer-risk-nutrient-study-11713908" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Underrated Nutrient Could Help Lower Your Colon Cancer Risk by 30%, New Study Says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Underrated Nutrient Could Help Lower Your Colon Cancer Risk by 30%, New Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who consumed more red meat appeared to have higher rates of death from different causes. On average, red meat enjoyers who died during the study ate more than 200 grams of red meat each week. For reference, there are approximately 28.35 grams in one ounce of red meat. This means if you have a piece of red meat weighing 8 ounces, it would be roughly 227 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumption of white meat, especially poultry, was related to certain mortality outcomes as well, particularly for those who ate well over 100 grams of chicken each week. While some cuts of chicken may weigh differently than others, a piece of skinless, boneless chicken typically weighs about 174 grams, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8030412/is-chicken-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a serving of chicken breast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a serving of chicken breast&lt;/a&gt; clocks in at about 85 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data conflicts with other data that suggests a possible positive effect of higher white meat consumption on gastric cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all studies, there are some key limitations to consider. The study didn’t gather details on processed poultry consumption or how poultry was prepared, as the dietary questionnaire only asked broadly about poultry consumption. This leaves room for uncertainty in understanding whether outcomes differ between those who consume more fast-food chicken and have a less nutrient-dense diet versus individuals who eat grilled chicken at home as part of a balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study lacked data on participants' physical activity, a crucial factor in health. This absence might lead to a slight over- or underestimation of the diet-health relationship. It is important to note that, as an observational study, the findings can only demonstrate associations rather than establish causal relationships. Despite these limitations, these findings add to the limited body of research examining poultry consumption and health outcomes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-d-colorectal-cancer-study-11716723" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Vitamin May Reduce Colon Cancer Risk by 58%, New Study Suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Vitamin May Reduce Colon Cancer Risk by 58%, New Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from this study provide a valuable lens for re-evaluating our typical food choices, especially concerning poultry consumption. If you're someone who regularly enjoys chicken-based meals, this research suggests it might be worth paying closer attention to portion sizes and frequency of consumption. It doesn't mean you have to avoid chicken altogether, but understanding how much you’re eating and balancing it with other protein sources, like fish, legumes or other plant-based options, may help lower potential health risks. Incorporating diverse foods into your diet can ensure you get a variety of nutrients while possibly minimizing negative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors do note that meat cooking and storage methods significantly influence the risk of developing gastrointestinal cancers, suggesting an increased risk of gastric and intestinal tumors among those who preferred well-done white or red meat, based on past data. Protein-rich foods, when cooked at high temperatures or heated for prolonged times, generate certain mutagenic compounds that are known to be carcinogenic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, adopting alternative cooking methods like steaming or baking, and moderating the intake of charred or smoked meats, may reduce exposure to these harmful compounds and potentially lower associated cancer risks. Also, some data suggests consumption of more ultra-processed foods is linked to negative health outcomes. That means leaning on chicken nuggets and other poultry-forward processed foods may be better off enjoyed once-in-a-while vs frequently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/processed-and-ultra-processed-foods-i-eat-every-day-8424131" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I’m a Dietitian, and These Are the Processed and Ultra-Processed Foods I Eat Every Day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;I’m a Dietitian, and These Are the Processed and Ultra-Processed Foods I Eat Every Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; highlights a potential link between eating more than 300 grams of poultry per week and an increased mortality risk from all causes and from gastric cancers. Ultimately, when it comes to diet, balance and moderation are key. While this study sheds light on the potential risks associated with higher poultry consumption, it’s important to view these findings as part of the bigger nutritional picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicken remains a valuable protein source, rich in essential nutrients like B vitamins, selenium and phosphorus, which contribute to overall health when consumed responsibly. By diversifying your protein choices and being mindful of cooking methods, you can enjoy chicken as part of a nutritious, well-rounded diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to make informed choices about your health, consider incorporating variety, moderation and simplicity into your meals. By pairing portions of poultry with plenty of vegetables, whole grains and other lean protein sources (including plant-based sources), you can create meals that are both satisfying and nutritious. Remember, no single food determines your health; it's the overall pattern of what you eat, how you prepare it and the lifestyle you lead that truly matters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/2057942/mediterranean-diet-chicken-recipes-that-are-full-of-flavor/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:23 Mediterranean Diet Chicken Recipes That Are Full of Flavor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;23 Mediterranean Diet Chicken Recipes That Are Full of Flavor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/study-chicken-mortality-risk-11720104" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 11:20:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9zczc0VUJaZXh2V0J5S1RqUEF2ZlM3Tms1aFRkbWNnX1YyRG81MGZCelowakVNaTU2aTJHTmNXZ3l4LWNpYmtGcm5YZzVrb05OYkRxTmhiS29uVTJ5T0ctaGNpR0dFdmgwUU4wZ2I1TUdJcGJvdGRlX3VqcDNveDg</guid></item><item><title>这种简单的日常活动可以帮助您延长寿命并帮助您的心脏-独立报 | This simple daily activity may help you live longer and aid your heart - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPUXZUdDM5RDlWN0RMSUhqRVQ2NzFGeF9qRVJXMHZfUHZUcE9mWWJxTUJveW9iTF9rTWd4SGtCRm15akUtdUJpWGdjT3hTbkFwRVlqT0RJZ19PbFpraFlZNHAxOEhmOFAyQ2hYTFE1bDVpZG42QUwzR0FHSW5qSmlKc3gwN2JsZXFtWEdmM0swNmFpNGJNaFV2VFFVbkI0TmNXWFE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 eWQiqu sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 cGmNxG"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iqSitv"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dlmCG"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 igdyzJ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cPkZJS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 fGzMFb sc-hez36s-16 fJelbS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 fiXggt"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 eSVQSf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 cDGSNR"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 kxbAkl"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 kGYWZt"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chicken is a staple on dinner tables around the world. From &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/274844/southern-style-oven-fried-chicken/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;crispy fried chicken&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sheet-pan-balsamic-chicken-asparagus-8780757" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;grilled breast fillets&lt;/a&gt; atop Caesar salads, it's hard to deny its universal appeal. After all, it's versatile, relatively affordable and often regarded as a healthier protein option compared to red meat. Chances are, if you're reading this, you’ve probably got some chicken in your fridge right now, just waiting to shine as the star of your next meal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s almost impressive how much chicken many people eat, with rates continuing to grow.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025 (DGA), consider poultry to include all kinds of chicken, turkey, duck, geese and even game birds like quail and pheasant. These guidelines recommend eating around 100 grams of poultry as a standard portion, suggesting it be included in meals about one to three times a week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But before you start seasoning that drumstick, you might want to hear about this new study. According to some preliminary research published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;, our love affair with chicken may come with a side of unexpected risks—specifically an increased risk of early death from certain gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although some expert panels, like the International Agency for Research on Cancer, suggests red and processed meats may be linked to negative health outcomes, research on poultry is limited, with only a few studies suggesting it might have a role in lowering the risk of death from all causes. &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; To bridge this gap, researchers evaluated the association between white meat consumption and early death from all causes and from gastrointestinal cancers, focusing on the effects of poultry consumption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study focused on groups of people who were carefully chosen to understand health and lifestyle patterns. Over 4,000 participants contributed key information through interviews conducted by medical staff. These interviews collected details about their demographic background, general health, lifestyle habits and personal history. Measurements of weight and height were taken, and blood pressure readings adhered to international standards. On average, the researchers followed up with the participants over 19 years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To analyze dietary habits, participants completed a validated questionnaire designed to reflect typical food consumption. Included was how much meat participants ate, dividing the consumption into red meat, poultry and total meat, sorted into four intake levels per type. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Their health status, including whether they were alive, had moved away or had died, was confirmed using local municipal records and a regional database. By analyzing these groups, the researchers aimed to understand how meat consumption might be linked to mortality. Advanced statistical methods were used to adjust for factors like age, sex and health conditions, ensuring the results were as accurate and reliable as possible.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it came to meat consumption, participants who died due to complications with gastrointestinal cancers tended to eat the most meat weekly compared to those who died from other causes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Eating more than 300 grams of poultry weekly was linked to a 27% higher risk of death&lt;/strong&gt; compared to eating less than 100 grams, with the risk becoming higher as the amount consumed increased. The risk increased progressively as the portion consumed increased and was greater when compared to the same portion of red meat. Male participants who ate more than 300 grams of poultry weekly had more than double the risk of dying from gastrointestinal cancer compared to those who ate less.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Across all 1,028 subjects who died, red meat made up about 59% of their weekly meat intake, with white meat accounting for roughly 41%—29% of that was poultry. Participants overall followed the Mediterranean diet reasonably well, which remained consistent across different causes of death.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who consumed more red meat appeared to have higher rates of death from different causes. On average, red meat enjoyers who died during the study ate more than 200 grams of red meat each week. For reference, there are approximately 28.35 grams in one ounce of red meat. This means if you have a piece of red meat weighing 8 ounces, it would be roughly 227 grams.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Consumption of white meat, especially poultry, was related to certain mortality outcomes as well, particularly for those who ate well over 100 grams of chicken each week. While some cuts of chicken may weigh differently than others, a piece of skinless, boneless chicken typically weighs about 174 grams, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8030412/is-chicken-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a serving of chicken breast&lt;/a&gt; clocks in at about 85 grams.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This data conflicts with other data that suggests a possible positive effect of higher white meat consumption on gastric cancer risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As with all studies, there are some key limitations to consider. The study didn’t gather details on processed poultry consumption or how poultry was prepared, as the dietary questionnaire only asked broadly about poultry consumption. This leaves room for uncertainty in understanding whether outcomes differ between those who consume more fast-food chicken and have a less nutrient-dense diet versus individuals who eat grilled chicken at home as part of a balanced diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, the study lacked data on participants' physical activity, a crucial factor in health. This absence might lead to a slight over- or underestimation of the diet-health relationship. It is important to note that, as an observational study, the findings can only demonstrate associations rather than establish causal relationships. Despite these limitations, these findings add to the limited body of research examining poultry consumption and health outcomes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The findings from this study provide a valuable lens for re-evaluating our typical food choices, especially concerning poultry consumption. If you're someone who regularly enjoys chicken-based meals, this research suggests it might be worth paying closer attention to portion sizes and frequency of consumption. It doesn't mean you have to avoid chicken altogether, but understanding how much you’re eating and balancing it with other protein sources, like fish, legumes or other plant-based options, may help lower potential health risks. Incorporating diverse foods into your diet can ensure you get a variety of nutrients while possibly minimizing negative outcomes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The authors do note that meat cooking and storage methods significantly influence the risk of developing gastrointestinal cancers, suggesting an increased risk of gastric and intestinal tumors among those who preferred well-done white or red meat, based on past data.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Protein-rich foods, when cooked at high temperatures or heated for prolonged times, generate certain mutagenic compounds that are known to be carcinogenic. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because of this, adopting alternative cooking methods like steaming or baking, and moderating the intake of charred or smoked meats, may reduce exposure to these harmful compounds and potentially lower associated cancer risks. Also, some data suggests consumption of more ultra-processed foods is linked to negative health outcomes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That means leaning on chicken nuggets and other poultry-forward processed foods may be better off enjoyed once-in-a-while vs frequently.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; highlights a potential link between eating more than 300 grams of poultry per week and an increased mortality risk from all causes and from gastric cancers. Ultimately, when it comes to diet, balance and moderation are key. While this study sheds light on the potential risks associated with higher poultry consumption, it’s important to view these findings as part of the bigger nutritional picture. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chicken remains a valuable protein source, rich in essential nutrients like B vitamins, selenium and phosphorus, which contribute to overall health when consumed responsibly. By diversifying your protein choices and being mindful of cooking methods, you can enjoy chicken as part of a nutritious, well-rounded diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to make informed choices about your health, consider incorporating variety, moderation and simplicity into your meals. By pairing portions of poultry with plenty of vegetables, whole grains and other lean protein sources (including plant-based sources), you can create meals that are both satisfying and nutritious. Remember, no single food determines your health; it's the overall pattern of what you eat, how you prepare it and the lifestyle you lead that truly matters.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Vitamin A is considered supportive care and typically used in countries where children are malnourished and have vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency in the United States affects &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622012238?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;less than 1 percent of the population,&lt;/a&gt; according to a nutrition report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F26D7YTPCFCGDL4K327FDAOFVQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The information gap has tangible consequences. Among parents, 24 percent who lean toward believing at least one of the three false claims say that they delayed or skipped some recommended vaccines for their children, according to the poll. That’s more than double compared with parents who say all three claims are “definitely” or “probably false” — 11 percent of those parents opted out of some recommended vaccines for their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F7CT2LCYNZB73PXJG7UNFPXOOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The divide is partisan, too. “We found that larger shares of Republicans compared with Democrats lean toward believing some of these falsehoods,” Hamel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N4FBUC7LNNARDD2TTILZJFRY3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Overall, the majority of parents still believe that the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks, Hamel said. But the number of parents that are skeptical — contending that the risks outweigh the benefits — has inched up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FCYGOMSB2JE3THS2MWZW43QD4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“An erosion in confidence in vaccines down the road could have greater effect,” Hamel said. “With something like measles that can be deadly for children, and where you need high levels of vaccination to keep it from circulating, even some of these small increases could have repercussions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3GRIYRGWTVEKHGQM3J2WXJ3RQE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lauren Weber, Lena H.

It’s the most common type of arthritis and occurs more often in older people, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/osteoarthritis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases&lt;/a&gt; (NIAMS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While everyone experiences the condition differently, people with osteoarthritis usually have joint pain and stiffness in the hands, knees, hips, neck and lower back, per NIAMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Pain from osteoarthritis can range from mild to severe,” Luke says. “It often presents as pain in your joints that is improved in the morning after rest and worsening throughout the day as you are more active.” Osteoarthritis may also cause you to have less of a range of motion than you did before, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The joint disease can be diagnosed through a physician’s exam and may include an X-ray or MRI, according to NIAMS. While there’s no cure for osteoarthritis, there are &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/arthritis-info/osteoarthritis/oa-treatments/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pain and anti-inflammatory medications;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;pain and anti-inflammatory medications&lt;/a&gt; that can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="you-strained-a-muscle"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You strained a muscle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Muscle strains happen when muscles are stretched beyond what they normally should, Mandelbaum explains. There are different types of strains — some are minor and others are more severe — and they most often &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/muscle-strains/symptoms-causes/syc-20450507" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:strike the lower back or hamstrings;cpos:17;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;strike the lower back or hamstrings&lt;/a&gt;. The typical treatment for strains includes rest, ice, compression and elevation, according to Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If it’s a simple strain, you’ll be back to it within 10 days to two weeks,” Mandelbaum says. “But it can take up to 12 weeks or more for more severe strains.” Surgery may be required in severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="signs-your-aches-are-due-to-aging"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signs your aches are due to aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Aches linked to aging are usually from osteoarthritis, Luke says. She lists these as signs that your aches are from getting older:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It gets worse throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It bothers you more after harder workouts or longer walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The pain happens on a pretty frequent basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-to-do-when-you-have-new-aches-and-pains"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do when you have new aches and pains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are a few things you can do if you notice new aches and pains. Icing the area can help tamp down inflammation, along with taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like ibuprofen or naproxen, Luke says. If your muscles are feeling tight, using some heat, like from a heating pad or warm compress, might also be helpful to loosen things up, Bawer says. (You can ice later, Ricciardi says.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unless you’re injured, movement is also key, according to Mandelbaum. “Our bodies are programmed to be active,” he says. That doesn’t mean you need to go out and run 5 miles if your legs are sore, but trying to walk a little may help your muscles loosen up, ultimately helping you to feel better, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Luke agrees. “Staying as active as possible with stretching and movement is important,” she says. “Not exercising or laying in bed is the worst thing you can do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="when-to-see-a-doctor-for-your-aches-and-pains"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor for your aches and pains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Given how common aches and pains are, it’s fair not to want to head to the doctor every time you feel a twinge. But Luke says it’s worth at least considering seeing a health care provider if you’re in pain or the achiness doesn’t get better over a few days after using treatments like heat (or ice), NSAIDs and stretching. Your doctor should be able to evaluate you and suggest a targeted treatment plan from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Luke also says that you shouldn’t shrug off osteoarthritis pain and assume you have to learn to live with it. “For arthritis-type pain, there are often &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:18;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoarthritis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351930" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interventions that may help too;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:18;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;interventions that may help too&lt;/a&gt;, like physical therapy, bracing or joint injections,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mandelbaum adds: “Pain is part of life, but managing it is an important part of health and wellness. Don’t ignore pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 09:00:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOZ282UXFhWDQ4T1dJek9UVHRkcy1MWHFHNkpXR3NvTXo2bUJBVG13U1JWdlV6S1ltZnpyS1hpVWNwc0tkTVJrTXVYZWxDRHR0SVZoR2lvRXM5Ui1FcmV6MmxVb2FQQ2tMSW9wWEJYOGpQSWFLeVdpNzliQWR2LTB5OG5aTF95YVdHcGtMelI3U05NcjFLYkgxTzRySXEwdWtFX3E2a1NKSzM5SkNPZ0VkWHRn</guid></item><item><title>民意调查发现，与麻疹一样，错误信息正在蔓延- NPR | Like measles, misinformation is spreading, poll finds - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxQbG9uMVFoWTVPWTliUFMxdzFDSXlnZy1HTWc5YWE4UGFtWFBGTmdOdnVoZnFTdXljVnRhbExhdW1Zc2JxclBjMHNnTGZUYWxNNVBSdnUzYlN1a1pkY2dJakR5WlNEQ25fdjM0MFV3NzhRYmZtVW8zN0stWDFqWDNFeENaZW5TMVlGelh3TlVOZlVNWXhFZ05UVmlId1hVYWpj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                A KFF poll found parents who believed a false claim about measles were more likely to skip or delay childhood vaccinations.

   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. has now reported more than 800 measles cases in at least two dozen states. The vast majority of cases — more than 600 — are in Texas. In the midst of the outbreak, a &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-the-publics-views-on-measles-outbreaks-and-misinformation" target="_blank"&gt;new poll&lt;/a&gt; shows how much misinformation people are seeing about measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The good news is the vast majority of people still have &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/30/nx-s1-5343997/measles-vaccine-hesitancy-enthusiasm-outbreaks" target="_blank"&gt;confidence in the safety &lt;/a&gt;of the measles vaccine, says &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/person/liz-hamel/" target="_blank"&gt;Liz Hamel&lt;/a&gt;, director of public opinion and survey research at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research organization which conducted the poll.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The bad news: People are being exposed to a lot of&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/14/1244690933/vaccine-expert-worries-child-measles-deaths-are-being-normalized" target="_blank"&gt; false claims about measles &lt;/a&gt;— and many don't know what to make of it.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"What we have seen is that a large share of people are at least somewhat uncertain about how to evaluate that misinformation," Hamel says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The survey was conducted earlier in April and included a nationally representative sample of 1,380 adults. Pollsters asked respondents about three false claims: that the measles vaccine is more dangerous than getting the disease; that the vaccine causes autism in children, and that vitamin A can prevent a measles infection. None of these things are true.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Only 5 percent of adults polled said they thought these falsehoods were definitely true, and a much larger share of respondents said they were "probably false" — but they weren't completely confident that these were falsehoods. Hamel says that shows there's a large group of people out there whose views on measles have room for uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And a significant proportion leaned toward saying these false claims about measles are probably true. For example, 1 in 4 adults polled said vitamin A either probably or definitely prevents measles. And 19% believed it was probably or definitely true that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is more dangerous than getting infected with measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The poll also found a clear political divide. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We see that Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to lean towards believing this misinformation about measles," Hamel says. "And that's true among parents as well."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Most parents in the poll said they do keep their children up to date on their recommended vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But among parents who said that at least one of these false claims was probably or definitely true, 1 in 4 said they'd either skipped or delayed some recommended vaccines for their kids.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Those parents are more than twice as likely to say that they have delayed or skipped some vaccines for their children compared to parents who don't believe any of those claims," Hamel says, adding, "I think this is one of the more concerning findings from the poll."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hamel says one big takeaway is that in a world where people are bombarded with health information — and misinformation — on all kinds of media platforms, they don't always know how to evaluate what they're hearing or reading or who to trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited by Jane Greenhalgh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INDIANAPOLIS — A Perry Township student is recovering after an overdose at school.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A letter sent to parents of students in the district obtained by 13News said the high school student was using a THC vape that unknowingly contained fentanyl. Narcan was administered to the student twice, and the student regained consciousness before first responders got to the school.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are thankful for our administration, police and school nurses for their swift and decisive actions today," the letter read.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The student was taken to the emergency room for further treatment. Their condition was described as "stable."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This incident highlights the very real dangers associated with vaping, particularly as many of these vapes are being laced with dangerous and illicit substances," the district wrote to parents. "While we are relieved that this situation did not result in a tragedy, it is crucial that we work together to ensure the safety of all students."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district urged parents to have a discussion with their student about the risks of ingesting hidden substances, which could have potentially deadly consequences.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Touching your toes is a common yardstick for flexibility. It's a handy method to gauge how supple your hamstrings are and how well your spine can move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And according to mobility coach &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/rogerframpton/?hl=en" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/rogerframpton/?hl=en" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Roger Frampton&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also a useful way to screen for potential kinetic chain issues in the hamstrings and back that could lead to injury down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Touching your toes is a position everyone should just have,” the founder of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://roger.coach/" target="_blank" data-url="https://roger.coach/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;The Frampton Method&lt;/a&gt; tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You should be able to fold your body in half the same way you should be able to sit in a deep squat position. I wouldn't say that if you can't touch your toes it's bad, you've probably just become tight in that area—or strong in that area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, he explains that if you do a lot of running, you're going to be using your hamstrings a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A consequence of that is limited range of motion. But you might be really good at running. Your hamstrings have become tight for a purpose: to make you more springy when you run.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-it-s-worth-being-able-to-touch-your-toes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why it's worth being able to touch your toes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why is learning to touch your toes—and improving the flexibility of your hamstrings—a worthwhile endeavor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wnsEJe8C56n5X9Y4pF8vA7" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wnsEJe8C56n5X9Y4pF8vA7 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having tight hamstrings can lead to back pain, according to Frampton, along with other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you start to feel stiffness and discomfort further up the kinetic chain [the interconnected muscles, joints and bones in your back body], and your ability to touch your toes is lacking, that's when trying to develop this flexibility can help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-measure-flexibility"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to measure flexibility&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of saying 'I can't touch my toes', measure what you actually can do,” Frampton advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one video on his Instagram page, he demonstrates how you can bend over and use a chair, blocks, a Wellington boot, and even a pet dog to measure flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn't really matter what you use, as long as it's an exact measure,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To practice touching your toes safely, while also establishing a baseline for how flexible you are, Frampton says there are three rules to follow:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your feet together, facing forwards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legs must stay straight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And the toe touching test must be done first thing in the morning without any training.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-learn-to-touch-your-toes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to learn to touch your toes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up, is the training. First, Frampton recommends learning to hinge safely with a flat back fold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This teaches you how to hinge your hips so you're not just using your back to touch your toes,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn proper hinge mechanics, Frampton suggests holding a broomstick handle against your back, then folding forward without letting the handle come away from the base of your lower back or back of your head. “You don't even have to fold that far,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now practice folding forward fully. “Folding is half hamstrings, half spine. You are stretching your hamstrings, but because you're folding, you're doing most of the moving through your spine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're struggling to touch your toes, Frampton swears by a 30-second technique you can try while waiting for your kettle to boil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how it works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets:&lt;/strong&gt; 3 &lt;strong&gt;Timing:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 seconds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pull up your trousers and mark on your leg where you can reach down to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Next sit on the floor with your legs straight, push your knees down with your hands and try to get your heels off the floor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you can't lift your heels, place a book under your knees and you'll find it's easier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reach forward as far as you can and hold this position for 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After half a minute, stand up and try to touch your toes, marking how far you can reach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully you've got a lower mark,” says Frampton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do three sets of 30 seconds every day and incorporate this drill into daily mobility training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, once a month, keep retesting as you work your way to getting closer to touching your toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
