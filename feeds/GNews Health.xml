Hospitalizations and emergency room visits for flu are also rising in L.A. and Orange counties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are at the point now where we’re starting to see a sharp rise in flu cases. This is a few weeks earlier than we usually experience, but very much akin to what was seen in the Southern Hemisphere’s experience with flu during their winter,” said Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional physician director of infectious diseases at Kaiser Permanente Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Kaiser, flu cases are primarily being seen in clinics so far, but hospitalizations typically rise after Christmas. “We expect to see the same this year, too,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The number of cases appears to be higher at an earlier time in the usual flu season than we’ve seen in years past,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu levels are high in San Francisco’s sewage as well as in wastewater across San José, Sunnyvale and Palo Alto, &lt;a class="link" href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; WastewaterSCAN and the &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.santaclaracounty.gov/health-information/health-data/respiratory-virus-data" target="_blank"&gt;Santa Clara County Public Health Department&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area of concern this winter has been the rise of a relatively new flu subvariant, known as H3N2 Flu A subclade K, which appeared toward the end of summer. That was months after officials decided which strains this fall’s flu vaccine would target. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subclade K “is causing an active, early flu season, with more cases occurring in some countries within the Northern Hemisphere,” the California Department of Public Health &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/RespiratoryVirusReport.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear whether subclade K will reduce the efficacy of this year’s flu shot. Data recently released in Britain showed this season’s vaccines were 70% to 75% effective against hospitalization for children from the flu, and 30% to 40% effective in adults, which is within expectations, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-49.html" target="_blank"&gt;noted.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests “that influenza vaccination remains an effective tool in preventing influenza-related hospitalizations this season,” according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the intended effectiveness of the flu vaccine against symptomatic disease caused by the new subvariant remains uncertain, the World Health Organization said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, flu rates in L.A. County remain relatively low, but are on the rise. Across California, flu hospitalizations are likewise low but increasing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a national level, severity indicators remain low, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the experience in other nations have led some experts to worry &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-02-11/worst-flu-season-in-5-years-hits-california"&gt;another severe flu season&lt;/a&gt; could be on deck for California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia’s flu season, which is seasonally opposite from California’s, came far earlier than usual, hit with record strength and was particularly hard on the nation’s children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan, Taiwan and Britain have also reported early spikes to their flu seasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whether or not this season will be more severe, only time will tell,” Hudson said of California. “We know that we have a mutation ... which may make the flu vaccine work less well. But the vaccine still offers excellent protection against hospitalization and death, even with the mutated strain in circulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on what happened in the Southern Hemisphere — particularly in Australia — “we are expecting this season to have a disproportionate impact on children under the age of 10,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, three flu-associated pediatric deaths have been reported nationally this season, including two &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-50.html" target="_blank"&gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the flu season that ended in September, 280 &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-05-02/cdc-reports-216-child-deaths-this-flu-season-the-most-in-15-years"&gt;children died from flu&lt;/a&gt; — the most since the swine flu pandemic season of 2009-10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the 2024-25 season was considered the worst flu season since 2017-18, and hit adults hard as well. At least 38,000 people died from the flu &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;last season&lt;/a&gt;, health authorities estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a little more than half of the children who died from flu had an underlying medical condition, and 89% of those who died were not vaccinated, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the children who died from flu last season, the most common &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;complications&lt;/a&gt; experienced before death were shock or sepsis, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, seizures and damage to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early diagnosis of flu can help stave off the worst by giving those who are sick time to take antiviral medications like Tamiflu. Three out of five children who died from the flu during the 2024-25 season never received antiviral medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Emergency warning signs of flu complications&lt;/a&gt; in children include trouble breathing; bluish lips or face; ribs pulling in with each breath; chest pain; severe muscle pain, in which a child may refuse to walk; dehydration, signs of which include no urine for eight hours or no tears when crying; seizures; fevers above 104 degrees that are not controlled by medication; fever or cough that improve but return or worsen; and any fever in newborns younger than 12 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the official start of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-11-04/during-cold-flu-season-youngest-students-germiest"&gt;the respiratory virus season&lt;/a&gt; Oct. 1, the CDC estimates there have been at least 1,900 flu-related deaths, 49,000 hospitalizations and 4.6 million illnesses nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have been urging everybody to get the flu vaccine — the CDC recommends it for everyone age 6 months and up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vaccination rates have been lagging. Among children age 6 months to 17 years, an estimated 40.8% had been vaccinated as of the first week of December, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/children-vaccination-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;National Immunization Survey&lt;/a&gt;. In the last season before the COVID-19 pandemic, flu vaccination rates were notably higher by this time of year, at 51.2%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of last flu season, only 49.8% of children and teens had been vaccinated, the survey estimated, down from the 62.4% who had gotten their shots by the end of the 2019-20 flu season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decline in flu vaccinations has been seen locally, too. “Notably, fewer influenza vaccines have been administered this year compared to the same period last year,” the Orange County Health Care Agency &lt;a class="link" href="https://myemail.constantcontact.com/CD-HEALTH-ALERT--2025-2026-Respiratory-Virus-Season-Update---Increasing-Influenza-and-Respiratory-Syncytial-Virus--RSV-.html?soid=1128423022889&amp;amp;aid=vDIRaAQ0y1w" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes about two weeks for protection to build, but getting vaccinated as soon as possible before travel or seeing friends and family “helps keep you and your loved ones safer,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said in a statement to The Times. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:20:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOZjdYLXk2dFZFRWZoc1JWbHdGRTFPWUs1UlRkSUJ5bFRaTDdLYUV0Smk2bUxHOGtNcnFfVDF1dkk4YURROUdXdnBtVGZaRkRDUVpRcVFiSTZ4VUdCT3VwVkl1cE1MMmdQdXBySGZOaHFVbXVYaVJpSkdhbUpsZlN5Znp1RWFTWE9CMTdDMW9USHktbjY0Y003WUhiT05NZEZ6SXhkMUg5dXBkZWVrVFEzRGJpaU4wOWQydGNn</guid></item><item><title>安德鲁·齐默恩（ Andrew Zimmern ）在食用普通香料后收缩的无法治愈的状况-外卖</title><link>https://www.thetakeout.com/2022093/andrew-zimmern-burning-mouth-syndrome-cumin/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="content" class="article"&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Television host and culinary adventurer Andrew Zimmern has eaten everything from fermented shark in Iceland (&lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/1578916/hakarl-shark-meat-anthony-bourdain/" target="_blank"&gt;which Anthony Bourdain refused to eat ever again&lt;/a&gt;) to still-beating snake hearts in Vietnam. But even with all of his experience, he was caught off guard by a painful, lingering condition he says he picked up while filming in northern Africa: burning mouth syndrome (BMS). Sometimes called glossodynia, BMS is characterized by a chronic, often unexplained burning or tingling sensation on the tongue, lips, or entire mouth. In an "Ask Me Anything" event on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3f63r4/comment/ctlown6/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, Zimmern explained what happened: "In 2005, I contracted a virus from eating tainted cumin in Northern Africa. Occasionally once a year I have a flare-up of a rare disease called burning mouth syndrome. I pass it off as a simple casualty of war." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/bizarre-foods-andrew-zimmern-things-famous-tv-chef/story?id=26815920" target="_blank"&gt;ABC&lt;/a&gt;, he elaborated further: "I carry medication around with me in case it flares up. It's been about two years since a flare-up, it's viral ... there are only a handful of people in the world who have it." At first, Zimmern believed he'd simply overwhelmed his taste buds — obviously an occupational hazard for someone whose job was once to literally consume weird meats around the world (&lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/andrew-zimmern-picks-the-best-and-worst-tasting-animal-1798251700/" target="_blank"&gt;here are his best- and worst-tasting animals&lt;/a&gt;). But even after returning home, the burning did not subside. Doctors eventually diagnosed him with the neuropathic condition, and its exact causes remain mysterious. Though there's more than a "handful" of people who have it, global estimates suggest that about 1–3% of the world's population experiences the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;
                    &lt;span class="gallery-image-credit"&gt;Ellionn/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But is a tainted spice really to blame? To be sure, cumin is one of the most heavily traded spices in the world, and because it's often sold ground, it is indeed vulnerable to both intentional and unintentional adulteration. The bulk spice is used daily in cuisines across North Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Latin America. Often sold in open sacks or scooped loose in outdoor markets, it's certainly possible for it to be exposed to dust, bacteria, and other nasty bits floating through the air. In 2015, one of the largest spice recalls in the U.S. involved cumin contaminated with peanut protein. Perhaps unsurprisingly, undisclosed allergens are actually one of &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/1853246/common-reasons-food-recalls/" target="_blank"&gt;the most common reasons foods are recalled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't seem that Zimmern has slowed down on his spicy foods or changed his adventurous behavior, other than carrying a steroidal rinse in case of flare-ups. He continues to travel and film internationally, but these days his focus is on his current show, "Wild Game Kitchen," where he cooks wild food over an open fire. His spicy experience is certainly a high-profile example of how even seasoned culinary professionals can develop chronic conditions from repeated sensory exposure. Today, North Africa remains one of Zimmern's favorite food regions, and he even still uses cumin in his recipes. But just in case we've scared you from ever using the earthy spice again, we've got &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/1754931/cumin-substitute-spices/" target="_blank"&gt;four substitutes for cumin in recipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Scientists have gotten an unprecedented look at how the human embryo implants in a uterus. They did this by creating very primitive, womb-like environments in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The goal is to help people have healthy babies by finding new clues to the causes of miscarriages and infertility. But the research raises tough ethical concerns. It was &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01232-2" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01230-9" target="_blank"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909(25)00436-9" target="_blank"&gt; papers&lt;/a&gt; in the journals &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cell Stem Cell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is really important work that's moving embryo research forward – an important advance in the search for scientific answers for what makes a pregnancy healthy," says &lt;a href="https://www.thehastingscenter.org/expert/insoo-hyun-phd/" target="_blank"&gt;Insoo Hyun&lt;/a&gt;, a bioethicist at The Hastings Center, a bioethics think tank, who was not involved in the research. "However, it also presents a technology that could be used for other purposes that are concerning."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;That includes the possibility of some day using this kind of technology to enable embryos to develop much further – perhaps even completely – in the lab. This process, called ectogenesis, has the potential to make a natural human womb unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That is very troubling," says &lt;a href="https://philosophy.wfu.edu/faculty-and-staff/current-faculty/" target="_blank"&gt;Ana Iltis&lt;/a&gt;, a bioethicist at Wake Forest University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the scientists working on this research argue that possibility remains theoretical, and the work could yield important clues to early human development.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is very exciting," says &lt;a href="https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/175076/jun-wu.html" target="_blank"&gt;Jun Wu&lt;/a&gt;, a molecular biologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the most important moments in a human embryo's journey to becoming a baby is when the microscopic ball of cells burrows into the womb. But that pivotal step of embryonic implantation has long been mysterious because it unfolds hidden inside the body.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Human implantation is essentially a black box — a mystery," Wu says. "Implantation happens very early on during pregnancy. Essentially we don't know when, we don't know where. It's happening in a womb we cannot have access to."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insights into the causes of miscarriage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the new research, Wu and colleagues in China obtained cells and tissue collected from the lining of wombs during routine medical procedures and figured out how to recreate a key part of the lining of the womb inside tiny plastic devices in their labs.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"You can call it: A womb on a chip," Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The scientists then placed human embryos donated for research after infertility treatments, as well as primitive embryo-like entities created from stem cells — called &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/02/516280895/embryo-experiments-reveal-earliest-human-development-but-stir-ethical-debate" target="_blank"&gt;embryoids&lt;/a&gt; — inside their tiny wombs on chips and peered through a microscope to watch what happened next.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we observed the entire sequence of human implantation," Wu says. "We are very excited about this."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers have already used their wombs on chips to discover clues about how embryos and wombs interact, which can "help us understand the implantation process at the molecular level," Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers also compared artificial wombs using cells from healthy wombs with &lt;strong&gt;artificial wombs&lt;/strong&gt; using cells from wombs of women who had miscarriages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We observed implantation failure right in front of our eyes, which is very surprising and also exciting," Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wu's team even screened more than 1,100 drugs to see if any might prevent miscarriages, and identified some that look promising.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A separate team in the U.K. did similar research in their lab in Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We've been able to observe some really fantastic aspects of human embryo development, many of which have never been seen before," says&lt;a href="https://www.babraham.ac.uk/our-research/epigenetics/peter-rugg-gunn" target="_blank"&gt; Peter Rugg-Gunn&lt;/a&gt;, a developmental biologist at the Babraham Institute. "To be able to see these events for the first time, it was fantastic."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other scientists hailed the research&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's very exciting," says &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/robin-lovell-badge" target="_blank"&gt;Robin Lovell-Badge&lt;/a&gt;, a developmental biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in London who was not involved in the research. "I think they will allow more information to be developed about this absolutely critical stage of human development which has to date been otherwise pretty much impossible to study."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;An ethical slippery slope?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Among the difficult ethical issues raised by the research are questions about destroying human embryos for research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"For those of us who believe that humans are humans and deserving of ethical respect, whether embryonic, adolescent, or elderly, these experiments are unethical," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014TpfuAAC/daniel-p-sulmasy-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Daniel Sulmasy&lt;/a&gt;, a Georgetown University bioethicist.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The experiments also raise questions about using these devices to study human embryos past 14 days of development, which is considered off limits in many places. (The researchers did not use their devices to try that.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are also concerns about implanting even primitive embryo models created from stem cells into anything that resembles a human womb.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Some might be concerned with how far this might go," says Hyun, the Hastings Center bioethicist. "It is a little bit on a slippery slope scientifically."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Indeed some bioethicists are very concerned about how far this may go.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's research that could facilitate future attempts to support not only research on early embryos but on growing embryos for significant periods of time in labs, perhaps eventually to the point of fetuses," says Iltis, the Wake Forest University bioethicist.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If that ever became possible, it raises the prospect of producing human fetuses for "spare parts," Iltis says. "They could be grown to be sources of organs and tissues for transplantation. That is very troubling."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers doing the work say their research is nowhere near that, and they have no intention to pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Development entirely outside the uterus is a science fiction," Wu says. "I don't think we're anywhere close to that."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Iltis argues other scientists are &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/12/1241895501/artificial-womb-premature-birth" target="_blank"&gt;already testing much larger artificial wombs &lt;/a&gt;to save very premature babies. So what sounds like science fiction today, could become a reality much sooner than many people think.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have this long history of saying, 'Don't worry. The science isn't there. That's not the goal. That's not what we're trying to do.' And then being presented with a breakthrough that signals that the train has left the station."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I don't think it's far-fetched to think that eventually it might be possible to create lab-generated tissues and organs through something like this technology."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A compound produced by gut bacteria could play a vital role in managing and preventing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-think-theyve-found-a-new-cause-of-type-2-diabetes"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, according to a study led by researchers from Imperial College London (ICL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small molecule, called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimethylamine"&gt;trimethylamine&lt;/a&gt; (TMA), is a major type of bacterial metabolite – a class of chemicals produced naturally through processes of transforming nutrients into energy and building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have now found evidence in human cell models and lab mice that TMA could protect the body from some of the damage triggered by a high-fat diet. Specifically, it has the effect of dampening down inflammation and improving insulin response, both of which reduce the risk of type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="186331" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/oral-health-and-diabetes-have-a-crucial-link-expert-reveals"&gt;Oral Health And Diabetes Have a Crucial Link, Expert Reveals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1075762"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; had already connected some of the dots between TMA and insulin resistance, though the metabolite's exact role in the chemical conversation between gut microbes and their host wasn't clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a series of experiments designed to screen for individual metabolites and test TMA's ability to mitigate the impacts of high-fat diets on mice and human tissues, the researchers found the abundant microbial chemical may break some of the links in the chain between diabetes, obesity, and low-level inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This flips the narrative," &lt;a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/articles/medicine/metabolism-digestion-reproduction/2025/microbial-molecule-offers-new-hope-for-diabetes/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; ICL biochemist Marc-Emmanuel Dumas. "We've shown that a molecule from our gut microbes can actually protect against the harmful effects of a poor diet through a new mechanism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186334" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186334" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/StudyGraphic.jpg" alt="Trimethylamine graphic" class="wp-image-186334 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/StudyGraphic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/StudyGraphic-600x393.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186334" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers investigated the effects of supplementing high-fat diets with a molecule called choline.

The researchers demonstrated that increasing choline in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-high-fat-meal-can-disrupt-blood-flow-to-your-brain-study-finds"&gt;high-fat diets&lt;/a&gt; blocked some of its worst consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed that TMA inhibits the IRAK4 protein, which usually triggers an inflammatory response when a high-fat diet is detected. In the future, a similar prevention might be replicated through drugs, reducing the degree of inflammation resulting from diets high in fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TMA has also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1215689109"&gt;been associated&lt;/a&gt; with cardiovascular disease in earlier studies, in part through the related compound trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) – so the twist that it can actually be beneficial to the body is an interesting one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In view of the growing threat of diabetes worldwide and its devastating complications for the whole patient, including the brain and heart, a new solution is direly needed," &lt;a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/articles/medicine/metabolism-digestion-reproduction/2025/microbial-molecule-offers-new-hope-for-diabetes/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; cardiologist and professor of medicine Peter Liu, from the University of Ottawa in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our team's work connecting Western-style foods, TMA produced by the microbiome, and its effect on the immune switch IRAK4, may open entirely new ways to treat or prevent diabetes, a known risk factor for heart disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's still early days for this research, and these findings will need to be replicated in human participants over a longer period of time.

&lt;p&gt;A highly contagious virus previously linked to mass whale strandings has been identified for the first time in Arctic cetaceans, using airborne breath samples collected by drones. The findings introduce a new method for monitoring marine mammal disease in remote, climate-sensitive ecosystems, and raise concerns about the spread of pathogens in rapidly warming ocean environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus, &lt;strong&gt;cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV)&lt;/strong&gt;, was detected in the exhaled breath, or “blow” of wild humpback, sperm, and fin whales. Scientists used drones fitted with sterile Petri dishes to capture droplets as the animals surfaced to breathe. These samples confirmed the presence of CeMV in waters north of the Arctic Circle, a region where its circulation had not previously been documented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CeMV is known for causing acute respiratory, immune and neurological damage in whales, dolphins and porpoises. First identified in 1987 along the US Atlantic coast, it has since been linked to mass mortality events globally. The emergence of the virus in Arctic whale populations suggests a shift in its geographic distribution, potentially influenced by climate change and species migration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/12917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BMC Veterinary Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, was led by Nord University in Norway and involved collaboration with King’s College London, the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, the University of Iceland and&lt;strong&gt; BIOS-CV&lt;/strong&gt; in Cape Verde. It represents the first confirmed use of drone-based sampling to detect a marine mammal virus in this region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Drone-Based Surveillance Confirms Virus in Whale Populations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The project spanned nine years, from 2016 to 2025, and involved drone sampling across the North-East Atlantic, including coastal regions of Norway, Iceland and Cape Verde. Researchers captured exhaled droplets from whales during surfacing events and analysed them for viral markers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CeMV was confirmed in multiple individuals, including humpback whales in northern Norway, a sperm whale exhibiting signs of poor condition, and a pilot whale found stranded. In one case, additional tissue sampling was conducted to corroborate results. All findings were verified through laboratory diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Drone whale sampling offered a minimally invasive solution for studying disease in free-ranging marine mammals. Unlike traditional biopsy or capture methods, drones allowed researchers to collect samples without direct contact or disruption. This approach is particularly suited to environments where logistics, weather and conservation ethics limit the feasibility of conventional wildlife surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also screened for other pathogens. Herpesviruses were identified in humpbacks across Norway, Iceland, and Cape Verde. However, no traces of avian influenza virus or &lt;em&gt;Brucella&lt;/em&gt; bacteria, both associated with previous cetacean die-offs, were found in the collected samples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Marine Mammal Disease in a Changing Arctic&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The presence of cetacean morbillivirus in &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/buried-under-arctic-ice-this-lifeform-is-thriving-scientists-say-it-wasnt-supposed-to-exist-there/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="93121" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Arctic waters &lt;/a&gt;adds to growing evidence that warming seas are reshaping the distribution of marine species and the diseases that affect them. As ocean temperatures rise, migratory and resident populations are overlapping in new ways, creating opportunities for viral transmission that were previously unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that seasonal feeding aggregations, where whales, seabirds and humans converge in dense biological activity, may facilitate the spread of CeMV. These gatherings are increasingly common in the North Atlantic and Arctic regions, where shifting prey patterns draw large numbers of marine species into shared feeding zones.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The detection of CeMV in multiple locations across a wide geographic range suggests that the virus is now established in certain Arctic populations. The findings support earlier concerns raised by virologists and marine ecologists about the vulnerability of high-latitude ecosystems to emerging infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peer-reviewed literature has documented similar patterns elsewhere. A 2018 study in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2018.00152/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frontiers in Veterinary Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; linked climate variability with increased exposure to morbilliviruses in marine mammals. The virus’s ability to jump between species and persist in migratory corridors heightens its risk profile, particularly in polar ecosystems undergoing rapid environmental change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Long-Term Monitoring and Implications for Conservation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to confirming viral presence, the research offers a framework for ongoing disease surveillance using low-cost, commercially available drones. Breath sampling requires less infrastructure than ship-based biopsy collection or necropsy and can be deployed in areas with minimal human footprint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Project lead Helena Costa of Nord University stated in the published paper that future research will focus on continuing drone-based surveillance to better understand how multiple environmental stressors are influencing whale health over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers recommend expanding monitoring efforts to additional migratory routes, particularly those connecting the Arctic with lower latitudes. Broader genomic analysis of CeMV strains may also be needed to determine whether the virus has evolved in response to new host species or environmental pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO — A dog in Chicago has tested positive for rabies, the Illinois Department of Public Health announced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s been at least 61 years since the last reported case of a rabid dog in Cook County. The last time the state reported a rabid dog was in 1994, according to a health department press release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dog was less than a year old and had been adopted by a Chicago home from a local rescue, which had received the puppies from a Florida rescue in May, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dog — which showed behavioral issues such as “growling, snapping, increased barking and anxiety” — bit a person Dec. 11, according to the release. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The dog’s behavior worsened Dec. 16, and it was euthanized two days later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two tests on Friday confirmed the dog was positive for rabies, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health department officials are investigating the strain and source of rabies in the dog, which was vaccinated for rabies in June.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s possible the dog was exposed to rabies before it had been vaccinated, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health officials are “evaluating any people in contact with the dog” to determine if they need treatment, and Cook County animal control officials are in touch with owners of littermates to the rabid dog, according to the news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coffee on its own doesn’t typically have a significant impact on your blood sugar levels. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding sweeteners and flavored creamers, among other factors, can increase your blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cut back on sweeteners, pair coffee with meals and stay active to limit glucose spikes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your blood sugar naturally fluctuates throughout the day. “Levels rise after meals for everyone because carbohydrates break down into glucose,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vnutritionandwellness.com/author/kathleen-benson/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kathleen Benson, CSSD, CPT, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. In people with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/insulin-resistance-symptoms-8611181" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;insulin resistance or diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, these increases may be higher and last longer because the body doesn’t respond to insulin as efficiently or doesn’t produce enough of it, Benson explains.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “For most people, blood sugar levels are lowest in the morning after fasting overnight and rise after meals as your body digests and absorbs carbohydrates,” adds &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/lauren-manaker/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN, LD, CLEC, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. Since many of us reach for a cup (or two) of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;coffee in the morning&lt;/a&gt;, you may wonder whether your daily brew is affecting your blood sugar levels at the start of each day. Our experts take a deep dive into how your morning java may affect your blood sugar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-coffee-affects-your-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Coffee Affects Your Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Coffee on its own typically doesn’t cause a significant rise in blood sugar itself,” Manaker says. It’s the other add-ons, like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/67340/how-to-cut-back-on-sneaky-added-sugars/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sugary syrups and certain sweeteners&lt;/a&gt;, that can lead to a temporary spike in blood glucose, Manaker notes. “If you’re drinking coffee &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; a meal, the impact on blood sugar is likely minimal, especially if the meal includes protein and healthy fats.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Those who are caffeine-sensitive and don’t have diabetes may also see a more dramatic increase in blood sugar compared to others. “Coffee can raise blood sugar for some people because caffeine can trigger hormones that tell the liver to release extra glucose,” Benson says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “This doesn’t happen to everyone, and the effect depends on how sensitive someone is to caffeine and how much they drink.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-factors-that-can-affect-how-coffee-impacts-your-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4 Factors That Can Affect How Coffee Impacts Your Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 1. The Type of Sweetener You Use &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A recent study suggests that drinking a few cups of black coffee daily is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, that isn’t the case when &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7912011/whats-the-big-deal-about-sugar-we-have-your-questions-answered/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt; or even artificial sweeteners are swirled in. “Added sugars—including table sugar, flavored syrups, honey and agave—can raise blood sugar because they’re quickly absorbed by the body,” Benson says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, if you do prefer something a little sweet in your morning cup of joe, using certain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290373/a-buyers-guide-to-sugar-substitutes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sugar-free sweeteners&lt;/a&gt; is still a better option, the experts say.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Sugar alcohols, like in ‘skinny’ syrups, may cause a smaller rise in blood sugar, while &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290579/is-stevia-safe/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nonnutritive sweeteners like stevia&lt;/a&gt; don’t raise blood sugar at all,” Benson says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To lessen the impact, Benson offers a few suggestions: gradually reduce added sugar, switch to half-syrup or use stevia to keep sweetness without the spike.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 2. The Type of Creamer You Add &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are so many types of creamers out there—and each can have a different impact on your blood sugar levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Sweetened creamers, especially flavored ones, often contain added sugars that raise blood sugar,” Benson says. “Even half-and-half or whole-milk creamers can raise blood sugar slightly in larger amounts due to natural lactose.” (Lactose is the naturally occurring sugar in dairy milk.)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitian-favorite-coffee-creamer-11827312" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nondairy creamers&lt;/a&gt; lack lactose, some make up for it with added sugars, Manaker says, which can lead to temporary spikes in blood sugar, too. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your move: Stick to 1 to 2 tablespoons of unsweetened creamers, like heavy cream, half-and-half or unsweetened plant-based milk, Benson says. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 3. Drinking Coffee on an Empty Stomach &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Drinking caffeine on an empty stomach can cause sharper blood sugar rises because there’s no protein, fat or fiber to buffer the stress-hormone response,” Benson says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Let’s break this down: Caffeine activates the body’s fight-or-flight response, increasing the release of stress hormones like cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones signal the liver to release stored glucose, which can lead to a rapid spike in blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you’re sipping coffee solo, you might miss out on the blood sugar–stabilizing benefits of protein,” Manaker says. “Pairing your coffee with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291961/10-high-protein-snacks-that-keep-you-feeling-full-longer/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein-rich snack or meal&lt;/a&gt; can help keep your blood sugar more stable.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Consider drinking your morning java alongside two scrambled eggs, one serving of Greek yogurt, or with a small bowl of cottage cheese and fruit, Benson says. Including protein at meals is often recommended to help stabilize post-meal glucose levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 4. Your Sensitivity to Caffeine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Some people are more &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-do-if-you-drink-too-much-coffee-in-the-am-11758446" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sensitive to caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, which can temporarily raise stress hormones like cortisol and lead to higher blood sugar levels,” Manaker says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “If this sounds like you, try limiting your coffee intake or switching to decaf.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re someone who doesn’t typically sleep well or works a high-stress job, you may already have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054352/6-fast-ways-to-lower-cortisol-levels/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;elevated cortisol levels&lt;/a&gt;, Benson notes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Adding caffeine on top can exaggerate the blood-glucose rise,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ease the impact by adopting sleep-hygiene strategies, drinking plenty of water and avoiding caffeine when you’re already stressed. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay active. &lt;/strong&gt;“Regular physical activity helps your body use insulin more effectively, keeping blood sugar levels in check,” Manaker says.&lt;span data-cite="12" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Even a 10-minute walk after meals can make a difference.”&lt;span data-cite="13" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Benson concurs, adding: “Light movement helps muscles use glucose more efficiently and reduces post-meal spikes.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat consistent meals, especially earlier in the day.&lt;/strong&gt; “Skipping meals can impair insulin sensitivity, leading to higher post-meal rises. It’s also been associated with higher long-term diabetes risk,” Benson says.&lt;span data-cite="14" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Most people see better blood sugar stability when they keep coffee as part of a balanced morning routine, not a replacement for breakfast.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; TL;DR: If you’re worried about your blood sugar levels, you don’t need to stop enjoying your morning cup of coffee—many people look&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;forward to that part of their day. Just keep in mind the factors that might adversely affect your glucose levels when you drink your cup of joe. If you have diabetes and you’re monitoring your blood glucose levels throughout the day, or you tend to feel jittery after your cup of java, you can ease any temporary blood sugar spikes by enjoying breakfast with your cup of coffee and staying active.

            As &lt;a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2025/12/aaa-year-end-holiday-travel-forecast/" target="_blank"&gt;millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt; hit the road or take to the skies for the holidays, another seasonal traveler is picking up speed: influenza.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000a3b6pp6bzu47u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu activity is already rising across the country. In the week ending December 13, roughly 4% of visits to health care providers were for respiratory illnesses, and nearly 10,000 patients were hospitalized with influenza, according to the latest &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-50.html" target="_blank"&gt;data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, released Friday. So far, three children already have died from flu-related causes this flu season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Those numbers mean the virus may be closer to home than many families realize. Holiday gatherings could include someone just recovering from the flu, or someone beginning to feel sick. Should they still show up to open presents on Christmas morning? How long should a visit be postponed before heading to grandma’s to bake cookies?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000c3b6ptc6ytuut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As flu cases climb, here are the flu-related rules families should know this holiday season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000e3b6p2nrpbckz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are several over-the-counter flu tests available in the United States, and they can be taken at home as a nasal swab, similar to Covid-19 tests.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000f3b6pz09khqpq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many doctors recommend taking a test as soon as you experience symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000g3b6pobmnbf81@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Particularly if you’re a person in a high-risk group,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000h3b6p8ne8t389@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those persons are people who are age 65 and older, anyone who has a chronic underlying medical condition, if you’re immune compromised, if you’re a pregnant person and very young children,” he said. “Those are all people who are in high-risk, and once they have symptoms, that’s the time to get tested, because we would have antivirals available to help keep you out of the hospital.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqa4t400003b6pn9ba9c8n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu symptoms usually start suddenly with fever, chills, headache, body aches and fatigue, Dr. Pamela Lindor, a pediatrician at Bluebird Kids Health in Jacksonville, Florida, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvemf7002b3b6pvfqqgaeg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While you should quickly start treatment and avoid exposing others when you test positive for flu, “if the over the counter test is negative but your symptoms are severe, consider getting a more accurate test from your doctor or urgent care center,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000i3b6pq7ud6plx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Testing is key because once it is determined which respiratory illness you have, you can then receive appropriate treatment, Schaffner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000j3b6pthof7fd3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Flu is not the only illness we’re concerned about. Maybe you have Covid, and if you have Covid, we have another medication that could help keep you out of the hospital,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000l3b6pa2a1im44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;antiviral drugs&lt;/a&gt;, such as Tamiflu or Xofluza, are prescription medications, and they work best when started early, ideally within two days after flu symptoms begin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000m3b6pipsesvhc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For the flu, if you are ill, the sooner you begin the antiviral, the more effective it is,” Schaffner said. “There is the 48-hour rule. That is, for it to be maximally effective, you have to initiate treatment within the first 48 hours after you get symptoms. But even after 48 hours – and this is especially true for high-risk people – you can still have some modulating effect of the antivirals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000o3b6pkszo022t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As soon as someone starts to show symptoms, they should stay home and avoid contact with other people to not spread the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000p3b6ppam78qp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You’re capable of transmitting the influenza virus the day before you get symptoms,” Schaffner said. “But nonetheless, wear a mask and avoid other people in your family as much as possible until your symptoms start to abate and you’ve had no fever for 24 hours without using Tylenol.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000q3b6phrc1drjg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the CDC, people can return to their normal activities when, for at least 24 hours, they have not had a fever without using fever-reduction medication, and their overall symptoms are improving.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvgd8d002m3b6pa1k022el@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This will usually be at least 4-5 days,” Lindor said. “Flu is most contagious starting the day before symptoms develop and continuing for about one week.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000s3b6pli9n7gb9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people who have symptoms or fever might be tempted to still visit family or open Christmas gifts with loved ones, as long as they wear a mask, but Schaffner still warned against it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000t3b6py0zaykoa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you’ve developed symptoms, I think you’ve got to stay home,” Schaffner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000u3b6ptcip4j16@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even if you say, ‘Well, I have these symptoms, but I’ll wear a mask.’ Yes, that will reduce the chance of spreading but not reduce it to zero. And guess what? It’s very hard to eat and drink with a mask on,” he said. “So, you will indeed be exposing people. And when you get to family members, even when you wear that mask, they’ll be hugging and kissing. These are very close circumstances, so you’ve got to restrain yourself and separate yourself, otherwise you are very much in danger of becoming a dreaded spreader.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvoi3q002z3b6pj0bxvehi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While someone with flu should take precautions to isolate themselves and not expose others, there are important steps their household members also can take to reduce their risk of getting sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvqa3y003a3b6p70vnu93r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Good handwashing is very important to prevent spread,” Lindor said. “Common surfaces in the house should be disinfected.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000w3b6pp4ww10no@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some doctors may prescribe antiviral medications to people who have been exposed to someone with flu, but they are not yet showing signs or symptoms themselves, especially if that person is in a high-risk group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvogqs002x3b6pyq50jf8t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Tamiflu can be prescribed to people who have been exposed to the flu, and is usually taken for 7-10 days to prevent infection,” Lindor said. “Xofluza can also be used prophylactically, and only one dose is needed, for adults and children 5 or older.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000x3b6pf9i36iiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, a 22-year-old college student may travel home for Christmas to visit their grandfather. The next day, after they have already visited their grandfather, they test positive for the flu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b3000y3b6plfl51ksj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Their grandfather is obviously in a high-risk group. Should the grandfather take Tamiflu for five days? That’s not a bad idea,” Schaffner said. “In that circumstance, it could very well avert the influenza infection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b300103b6p43zxhtdl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s important to stay in contact with your doctor once you test positive for flu and experience worsening symptoms, especially if you are in a high-risk group, Schaffner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b300113b6pvdkxbse9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And with your doctor, “have those discussions about when it is that you need to go to the hospital,” he said. “But difficulty breathing, coughing up blood, really feeling terrible, temperatures of 103 or higher – all of those things are indicators that you really need medical attention.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvtdmi003g3b6po36s9upi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some other “warning signs” that may require urgent medical attention include “dehydration, chest pain, lethargy, mental status changes, seizures or severe weakness,” Lindor said. “Confusion, behavior changes, or high persistent fever for over 3 days also warrant urgent medical attention.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b300133b6pg6wainq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is still time to receive your seasonal flu shot if you haven’t already.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b300143b6p5lzbcy2v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For all those people out there who are still well, if you haven’t been vaccinated, please get the vaccine. Don’t linger,” Schaffner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhqn8b300153b6plmkiy2u1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s a holiday present to you and to everyone else around you,” he said. “There’s more than one kind of influenza virus out there, and the vaccine helps prevent serious disease due to three different types of influenza virus.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjhvueqr003o3b6p46j2ysw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lindor said that overall, the best way to avoid having the flu disrupt family gatherings during the holidays is “for all family members to get their flu vaccine early in the flu season each year.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

"The study's findings also align with earlier data showing that omega-3s help regulate prostaglandins, which play a role in headache inflammation," says Church.

This means a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/22-high-fiber-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diet high in fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;diet high in fiber&lt;/a&gt;, probiotics, and prebiotics should also be focused on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains contain &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10498976/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fermentable fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fermentable fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which bacteria in the gut can digest.

Then eat until you are no longer hungry, not till you’re full. This may look like trying everything, but having just a bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Substitute when you can at holiday meals, for example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use extra virgin &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12174621/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:olive oil instead of butter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;olive oil instead of butter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use yogurt instead of &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/heavy-cream-substitutes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cream;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cream&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use cauliflower puree instead of white potatoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have wild fatty fish instead of red meat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drink seltzer water with fresh lemon or lime instead of sugary drinks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routhenstein noted the following ways you may be able to support your mood and mental health with food during the holidays:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan ahead:&lt;/strong&gt; Think about meals, gatherings, and activities in advance to reduce last-minute stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain your routine:&lt;/strong&gt; Try not to stray too far from your regular sleep, movement, and eating habits. Small consistency matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set boundaries: &lt;/strong&gt;Protect your time and energy, say no when needed, and carve out moments for rest or self-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindful indulgence:&lt;/strong&gt; Enjoy holiday treats in a way that feels satisfying without feeling extreme or restrictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Combining mindful nutrition with stress management can help you feel more balanced, energized, and emotionally resilient during the holidays,” said Routhenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;View the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/mood-boosting-happiness-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Healthline;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 11:16:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5BLXJDdGNtdjMwNktpWTdENXhjcGNNckcxOVo1R25yVGpWMndSNWZuNGRVeG9Zc2Q5N2V4UUdPaGhmakxlcGRzU1FIT0hzOGNKbUtnUncyaGJTUXVaUFhXbnU4M1FEQVFMekZDZGpOUGNteEZZenlITFBsb19DUQ</guid></item><item><title>流感正在科罗拉多州肆虐，但在家中测试和接种疫苗比以往任何时候都更容易-科罗拉多州公共广播电台</title><link>https://www.cpr.org/2025/12/23/colorado-flu-season-test-vaccinate-at-home/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By a variety of measures, influenza is pounding Colorado with a punch this December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This year has been this unprecedented season where we're seeing a lot of influenza activity,” said Dr. Suchitra Rao, an infectious diseases pediatrician with Children’s Hospital Colorado. “We were seeing our first cases of flu in Colorado before we were seeing our first snow in Colorado.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment this week confirmed its first influenza-associated pediatric death of the 2025-26 viral respiratory disease season. The child was elementary school-aged from metro Denver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the Colorado pediatric flu death is one of three in the country so far this season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During most seasons 80 to 90% of flu-related pediatric deaths happen in kids who are not fully vaccinated against flu,” said Jason Lefevre, CDC Public Affairs Specialist, via email. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last respiratory season, Colorado reported three pediatric flu deaths. The most recorded in recent years was 2019-20, when four Colorado children died from flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pediatric flu deaths in Colorado in by respiratory season:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="article__contained wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;2019-20: 4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2020-21: 0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2021-22: 1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2022-23: 2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2023-24: 3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2024-25: 3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2025-26: 1, (as of Dec. 19)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Source:  Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu hospitalizations are rising sharply in Colorado — 334 people are currently hospitalized with influenza, according to the state’s &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/viral-respiratory-diseases-report"&gt;online viral respiratory diseases report&lt;/a&gt;. That’s 3.5 times the number Colorado recorded this same week last year; the last time flu hospitalizations were this high was late February. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the best protection, doctors urge Coloradans to get vaccinated, but so far not that many are, though the numbers increase every week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six percent of Coloradans, about 2% less than this time last year, have &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/respiratory-virus-immunization-data"&gt;received a flu immunization&lt;/a&gt; this season, according to the dashboard. A little higher percentage (28%) of those 6 months to 9 years old have gotten a flu vaccine; just 19% of those 10-19 years have gotten it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image article__contained size-full"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credit"&gt;John Daley/CPR NEws&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents 65 and older have the highest flu vaccination rate, with 48%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of pediatric hospitalizations, defined as younger than 18, is 71, which is about six times what it was a month ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rao said the numbers matched what she was seeing as she worked in the hospital over Thanksgiving. “It was inundated with children with influenza,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pediatric clinics in Colorado have been busy too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We're seeing tons of influenza A right now,” said Dr. Shen Nagel, a pediatrician with Wheat Ridge clinic Pediatrics West. “It was an early start to the season and has just kept increasing thus far,” which he said is pretty consistent with what was seen in the southern hemisphere, which had a severe season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the high numbers to start, the clinic is also seeing an increase in hospitalizations amongst its patients, especially infants and toddlers, as well as complications like pneumonias, even in older kids.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more severe illnesses and complications tend to be occurring in unimmunized kids. And with the holiday season, I'd expect even more in the next month,” Nagel said. “So it's still reasonable to get a flu shot even though we're fully into flu season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state’s chief medical officer, Dr. Ned Calonge, underscored that message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The flu vaccine remains the single most effective tool we have to prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and death. Because we are seeing this early surge in cases, now is the ideal time to get protected before the peak of the season,” said Calonge, via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He strongly encourages Coloradans to stay current on other respiratory immunizations. “You can safely receive a COVID-19 vaccine at the same appointment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-49.html#:~:text=on%20FluView%20Interactive.-,Key%20Points,by%20CDC%20in%20August%202025."&gt;national map&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed Colorado in dark red, one of a few states with the highest flu activity, categorized as very high, along with Louisiana, New York and New Jersey. In New York City, the nation’s largest, the activity is also classified as very high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regions with the state’s biggest population centers, in the Denver metro area and El Paso County, home to Colorado Springs, along with the Eastern Plains, were seeing the highest rates of flu, according to the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But cases are popping up around the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Mesa County, for example, hospitalizations related to the flu are up 50% compared to a year ago. Kathleen Satterfield, epidemiologist supervisor at Mesa County Public Health, said her office has recorded 18 hospitalizations since October compared to 12 for the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have also seen and investigated six outbreaks since Dec. 9 of influenza,” Satterfield said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those numbers put Mesa County at 11 hospitalizations per 100,000 people, higher than the current state average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Easier than ever to detect, vaccinate for flu at home&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say it's worth knowing that there are now at-home rapid flu tests, similar to COVID-19 tests, as well as a nasal spray vaccine one can self-administer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rao said some of the rapid tests come just as individual flu tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image article__contained size-full"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credit"&gt;John Daley/CPR News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-block-image__caption"&gt;An at-home test, just like the COVID-19 tests, can tell a person if they are infected with Influenza type A or B. This test also tests for COVID-19. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of them come combined with COVID testing as well. And they do a similar thing,” she said. “So you have a swab, you put it in your nose and then you can get your test result within 15 to 20 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said you can buy it at a pharmacy, grocery store or online, and a number of the tests are also covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the nasal spray flu vaccine, sold under the brand name &lt;a href="https://www.flumist.com/ordering-using-at-home"&gt;FluMist&lt;/a&gt;, has actually been around for a number of years now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New this season, Rao said, people can self-administer it from the comfort of their living room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can order it from a website, which asks screening questions to make sure you're eligible and check if your insurance will cover it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So then you can just use the spray yourself,” Rao said. “And then if you're a parent or a caregiver, you can also administer it for your kids as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rao said it's considered as effective as a regular shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom Hesse contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Colorado Public Radio</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 11:02:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE5mYW4zS0w2NlFMYWxzenYwT1FMY0M2N1IzcU9GaUV4UkJHVGw0OFJFejhLMDhiaDUyZ2IzSEdjanVqamJfTGo0elpMSWEtQTFUbU5pUFhuSmlRTDRkSUc5QW1fZDF6cHZwOFgzMjQ2TllDby1PQ1dqeS1FMFV1RlE</guid></item><item><title>如果有人通常在早上不吃早餐，他们就会低调地挣扎于这11件事- YourTango</title><link>https://www.yourtango.com/self/if-someone-usually-skips-breakfast-morning-theyre-lowkey-struggling-these-things</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breakfast is named the “most important meal of the day” for a reason. Not only does it tend to jumpstart the metabolism and increase nutrition throughout the day, according to &lt;a href="https://www.rush.edu/news/why-you-should-eat-breakfast" rel="nofollow"&gt;the Rush University System for Health&lt;/a&gt;, but it also improves cognitive function, performance, and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if someone usually skips breakfast in the morning, it's likely that they’re lowkey struggling with certain things, no matter how much they try to hide it. The seemingly small decision to skip breakfast has big consequences. It may feel like they’re too busy to wake up early or not hungry enough to eat breakfast, but in the end, it’s their well-being that’s at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If someone usually skips breakfast in the morning, they’re lowkey struggling with these 11 things&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.  Time management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-12/if-someone-usually-skips-breakfast-in-morning-lowkey-struggling-things-time-management.png" alt="Man struggling with time management and drinking coffee" title="time management if someone usually skips breakfast in the morning they're lowkey struggling with these things" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;PeopleImages | Shutterstock.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time management is a struggle for many people, especially when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.morningside.edu/news/mastering-time-management-consistency-and-study-habits-in-academics" rel="nofollow"&gt;setting priorities and minimizing distractions&lt;/a&gt;. For people who regularly deal with chaotic mornings and unprepared rituals, distractions may be their only way to get through the day without falling victim to stress and worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they didn’t get enough sleep, chances are skipping breakfast is their only way of reclaiming some time. They scroll from their phones in the morning and struggle to set a schedule, so by the time they need to leave the house, they’re already rushing around to get the bare necessities done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-productive-people-do-every-morning-lazy-people-hit-snooze"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 Things Productive People Do Every Morning That Lazy People Hit Snooze On&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Their sleep schedule&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of negatively affecting &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2025/08/sleep-mental-health-connection-what-science-says.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;general mood and mental health&lt;/a&gt;, a poor sleep schedule can also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250729001227.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;harm physical well-being&lt;/a&gt;, putting you at risk for lower energy levels, more fatigue, and even more frequent illness. So, if someone isn’t getting enough sleep every night and consistently wakes up feeling tired, anxious, and unrested, breakfast might be one of the first things they sacrifice to snooze their alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if it leads to more fatigue later in the day and consistently lower energy levels, it feels like the only thing they can do to cope with their chronic tiredness in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.  Chaotic mornings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s mothers feeling burdened by caring for their kids and prepping their households or someone struggling with a lack of sleep before going to work, if someone usually skips breakfast, they may be lowkey struggling with morning chaos. Everything feels “behind,” there are a million responsibilities to get through, and never enough time, which leads to sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Especially considering stress hormones associated with emotional exhaustion and chaos affect appetite, according to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306453000000354?via%3Dihub" rel="nofollow"&gt;a study published in the Psychoneuroendocrinology journal&lt;/a&gt;, someone skipping breakfast may not even feel hungry enough to carve out time for a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/subtle-signs-not-just-stressed-completely-exhausted-emotionally"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15 Subtle Signs You're Not Just Stressed, You're Completely Exhausted Emotionally&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Decision fatigue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone has so many responsibilities and stressors that they don’t know where to start, that’s often called &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/decision-fatigue" rel="nofollow"&gt;decision fatigue&lt;/a&gt;. There are so many decisions to make and things to prioritize that, when it comes to actually doing them, especially amid the morning pressure, nothing gets done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of struggle may also worsen mental clarity and energy, leading to avoidant behaviors that keep people from routines and habits that actually add value. From eating breakfast to going to bed early, and even disconnecting from technology, the more possible decisions a person has, the more likely they are to rely on easy, convenient choices to cope, even if they’re not healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-smart-people-do-in-the-morning-normal-people-cant-stand"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Things Smart People Do In The Morning That Normal People Can't Stand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5.

They’re living in a state of “fight or flight,” where even the &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/simple-daily-tasks-feel-impossible-when-body-stuck-fight-flight-mode"&gt;most basic tasks feel impossible&lt;/a&gt; to make time and energy for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if someone skips breakfast in the morning, they’re likely lowkey struggling with stress. They have so much on their mind that basic self-care isn't important enough to make time for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health/strange-signals-body-sends-when-under-too-much-stress"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 Strange Signals Your Body Sends When You're Under Too Much Stress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Disconnection from their body&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone feels a lack of control, chances are they’re simultaneously &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-derealization-overview"&gt;feeling disconnected from themselves&lt;/a&gt;. They don’t have a stable kind of trust in their bodies, and they often struggle to listen to small cues, such as fatigue or anxiety, that bubble up internally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They lean on avoidance and distractions to get through the day, so in the morning, when they’re working to avoid constant stress and worry, eating is the last thing on their mind. Especially if it forces them to lean into quiet time and mindfulness, prioritizing can feel entirely destabilizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. A survival mindset&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone with a &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrycentre.co.uk/blog/am-i-in-survival-mode-how-to-know-and-what-to-do-about-it/" rel="nofollow"&gt;survival mindset is likely more willing to sacrifice seemingly unnecessary habits&lt;/a&gt; like eating breakfast to focus on the small things that really matter. If someone usually skips breakfast in the morning, they may feel like they’re coping with avoidance. They’re focusing on things they view as obligations, while sabotaging their well-being by avoiding self-care and rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s exhausting to feel like you’re surviving, rather than living. You miss out on the joy because you’re so caught up in the obligation and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health/signs-youre-stuck-in-survival-mode"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9 Signs You're Stuck In Survival Mode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Caretaking burdens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Especially for &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-most-gen-x-people-struggling-with-this-year"&gt;the sandwich generation&lt;/a&gt;, who are not only caring for themselves, but also their kids and aging parents, caring for personal needs can feel like less of a priority. Alongside this stress and obligation, skipping breakfast or meals may feel like the only way to show up. But if you’re not taking care of yourself, you’ll have less energy, love, and attention to offer the people around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t let caretaking burn you out. Carve out mindful time to connect with yourself, even if it means waking up 5 minutes earlier to have breakfast and reflect on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Low motivation or self-discipline&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-12/if-someone-usually-skips-breakfast-in-morning-lowkey-struggling-things-low-motivation-self-discipline.png" alt="Woman struggling with a lack of motivation and self-discipline" title="lack motivation self-discipline if someone usually skips breakfast in the morning they're lowkey struggling with these things" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;nice to meet u | Shutterstock.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health and motivation &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-8954/12/8/281" rel="nofollow"&gt;are often inherently linked&lt;/a&gt;. If your brain and body are too caught up in the stress of managing depression or chronic stress, chances are your motivation to make time for things like working out or eating breakfast is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone skips breakfast in the morning, they’re lowkey struggling with these things. They’re trying to cope with stress and inner emotional strain, but missing out on the benefits of small rituals and routines that add structure and intentionality to their days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/habits-help-mental-health-cant-see-therapist"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13 Tiny Habits That'll Help Your Mental Health (If You Can't See A Therapist)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10. A lack of routine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A routine, especially in the morning, &lt;a href="https://www.restorationpsychservices.com/post/rise-shine-how-a-fulfilling-morning-routine-transforms-your-life" rel="nofollow"&gt;can set the tone for the entire day&lt;/a&gt;. It can provide structure for you to manage discomfort, help to relieve stress, and even energize you when things feel chaotic. However, people who miss out on small rituals and routines, like eating breakfast, often find themselves wandering aimlessly amid these stressors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s work obligations or stress with parenting, people who skip breakfast sabotage their routines. They’re forced to do more heavy lifting in the afternoon when they’re feeling exhausted and often battle through a morning fog that could easily be addressed with a quick meal first thing in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11. Poor work-life balance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone has poor work-life balance and vague boundaries, chances are their morning routines are riddled with stress and obligations. Whether it’s responding to work emails from bed, when their brains are supposed to be rising naturally, or skipping breakfast to get into work earlier, they regularly put their own well-being on hold for the sake of misguided company loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if it seems impossible to ignore, there’s always space to carve out room for yourself.

It was in a lab at Harvard, while an undergraduate in the late 1970s, where he had this realization: A castrated male lizard put in a cage with a female would not perform its mating ritual and would be uninterested in the female; but the same lizard, dosed with testosterone in the areas of the brain sensitive to testosterone, would — its dewlap coming out, head bobbing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is what he thought about when, about a decade later and a newly minted urologist, he began dosing men with testosterone. The patients were miserable, complaining of a lack of sex drive so severe it was ruining their relationships and lives. They were often coming for a second, third, even fourth opinion, after other specialists had been unable to help. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Could they be like the lizards? Could testosterone help them? But there was a problem. “In my training residency, I was taught that if a healthy man got an injection of testosterone today, he would come back in one month with prostate cancer,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the time, testosterone treatment was limited to a few rare cases of severe hypogonadism, and no one — or no one that Morgentaler knew of — was even considering dosing men who had gone through puberty with the hormone. But his patients were so desperate that even as he discussed the risk of prostate cancer and demanded they get a biopsy to make sure they didn’t already have any cancer (an invasive, painful procedure at a time when anesthetizing the prostate was challenging), they were willing to take the risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So was he. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He started measuring patients’ testosterone levels, which he had never done in his training, and by trial and error landed on dosage and protocols that worked for them. He monitored their progress, and took note of the benefits they were reporting, which often included improved mood or better stamina. “I have to tell you, it was scary,” said Morgentaler, now a Blavatnik faculty fellow in health and longevity at Harvard Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“The benefits were obvious to me and I felt like I had this magic sauce that nobody else had. It didn’t feel right: I was too young a guy, not established well,” he said. “I worried that I was making a deal with the devil that the men were getting benefits now, but maybe I was putting them at risk, and they would get prostate cancer later on.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Except, his patients weren’t getting sick. Not after a month, or many months. “The first indication I had there was something wrong with the story was my guys were doing well. I was monitoring them like crazy,” he said, noting that urologists “see themselves as protectors of the prostate,” so putting this particular organ at risk was especially concerning to him. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It took four decades, but the medical consensus now aligns with his clinical evidence: testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2813293#:~:text=Findings%20During%2014%20304%20person,not%20differ%20significantly%20between%20groups." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;does not increase their risk&lt;/a&gt; of prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a recent conversation with STAT, Morgentaler discussed what led to decades of shunning of testosterone treatment, as well as why this hormone continues to be “medically politicized” even as study after study confirms its safety and benefit for men with low levels of testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you started practicing in the late 1980s, testosterone therapy had been all but nonexistent in the U.S. for decades — why so? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of the universal belief that testosterone causes prostate cancer. The teaching was that eunuchs — men who had lost their testicles — never got prostate cancer. Today, I can tell you that there’s no basis for that, but that was universally believed and taught. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What propelled me into national awareness around testosterone was that right away I found prostate cancer in these men who should have never had prostate cancer because they had low testosterone. The belief was if you had low testosterone, you should be protected for life — but we didn’t just find some cancers, we found a lot. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But there was a time when testosterone was widely used?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was a golden period for testosterone use in the late 1930s up to 1940, after the identification and the synthesis of testosterone by three Nobel Prize winner groups in 1935.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In 1940, in a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJM194005232222104" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; article, Dr. Joseph Aub talks about it as one of the most potent medications in the doctor’s armamentarium. He describes many of the things we recognize today: people were using testosterone for angina, with excellent results; they used it for vascular lesions that were not healing — excellent results. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1941, that golden era ended. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fellow named Charles Huggins &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/article-abstract/545269" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published a paper&lt;/a&gt; with his co-author, Clarence Hodges. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He wrote that in men with metastatic prostate cancer, when he removed the testicles or gave estrogen to lower testosterone, the acid phosphatase [an enzyme that is elevated in cases in patients with prostate cancer] came down, and in every case in which he gave testosterone, the acid phosphatase rose. He concluded that testosterone activated prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But you eventually found out it wasn’t so. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’d heard of this on the first day of urology training. Huggins, he went on to win the Nobel Prize, he’s the most important figure in urology ever, he’s like a god in urology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have access to anybody’s library that had articles going back to 1941, so I had to go to the medical library at Harvard: you go down the basement and they’ve got the archives, they’ve got the journals. I found the dusty thing — I’m blowing dust off of this thick volume — and I read the article. And I got so nervous because there’s Huggins, in black and white, saying “every patient I gave testosterone to his acid phosphatase went up.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The last sentence of the article says testosterone injections activate prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I’m thinking: “I’ve got 100s of patients now on testosterone, my guys are gonna get cancer, Huggins says so.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But I forced myself to reread the article as if I needed to present it, and asked basic questions: How many patients did he treat? How many patients that he had castrated?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it turned out that he only gave testosterone injections to three men. Of the three, he only gave results for two of them. One of those men had already been castrated. In the end, there’s really just one man previously untreated who got testosterone, and his blood test results are all over the place. It’s uninterpretable. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The whole thing was based on one patient treated for 18 days. That was the basis for the next 60 years of physicians being unwilling to treat men with testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s an unbelievable thing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The review you &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMra022251" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;published in 2004&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; showing there was no compelling scientific evidence that testosterone treatment leads to prostate cancer marked the beginning of a new era for testosterone. More studies since have confirmed its safety profile, yet a kind of ambivalence toward testosterone therapy still lingers. Why? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even the best scientists are very susceptible to narratives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testosterone has been medically politicized, and you have these camps that are too polarized. You have the, let’s call them “establishment” academic medical people. They have opinions about testosterone that are not based on clinical experience. They have a pre-formed idea that it has limited value, that there are very few real candidates, and since they don’t treat patients, they get no feedback from them. And then you have the people who think that it’s the answer to everything. And of course that leaves a lot of room in between. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is what the field has to fight: an a priori belief that people already know what testosterone is, and its reputation is actually dismal. And it’s not just the medical community that has this, it’s that everybody in the world has heard the word testosterone and everybody seems to have an opinion about it, as a stand-in for what people think male energy or masculinity is about. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s not so long since testosterone has been rehabilitated in medicine. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that it’s such a recent phenomenon, if you will, shows up in a couple of different ways. First of all, it’s not taught in medical school, as a rule. Unless the medical school education involves almost exclusively a urologist who practices sexual medicine, it won’t be taught at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re an educator in medicine, there’s a good chance that your training occurred before the introduction of so much testosterone and testosterone research. For many of us, once we leave medical school and residency, our attitudes are often formed and set, and our beliefs about certain things are well established. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re really only one generation removed, and so I think it’ll take time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This shows some parallels with what happened with the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/25/nx-s1-5477644/menopause-hormone-therapy-fda-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women’s Health Initiative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: It took two decades to remove the “black label” warning for estrogen therapy for menopause.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I wrote a paper once with some colleagues about hormonophobia, and I think the common thing is about sex. It’s not that they’re hormones, like nobody has this feeling about thyroid hormone; it’s sexual hormones. It’s about a certain level of repression and discomfort around sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You often talk about how testosterone highlights some of medicine’s weak spots as a discipline more broadly, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the things that’s lost in the discussion of testosterone is what the impact is on an individual and how they experience life. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[When I started prescribing testosterone], I didn’t know what was supposed to happen because it wasn’t taught, it wasn’t in the textbooks. So I asked my patients what they noticed, and the responses were fascinating, and I didn’t quite know what to do with all of it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My hope was that the sexual symptoms would get better and for most of these guys, they did improve. That was great, but they said other things outside of sex that I didn’t have any way to anticipate. I heard things like, “I wake up in the morning with a sense of optimism. I haven’t felt that way in many years”; “my wife likes me again … she thinks I am nicer to her.” Men would say, “I have confidence, I’d forgotten how I used to feel that way.” One guy said, “now that I’m on testosterone, what I see is that before I was seeing the world in black and white, and now I see it in color.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testosterone is a brain hormone and it has a lot of functions. One of the things that the research has shown, and our patients tell us regularly, is that their mood has improved. But it’s difficult in medicine to come up with instruments that necessarily capture the range of human experience. And one of the problems in what I call the evidence-based era is two things that have been almost completely dismissed: One is clinical experience, and the other is patient symptoms and experience. I was taught to not pay attention to what patients say because it’s not reliable. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think that medicine has lost its humanity in that way.&lt;/p&gt;

How everyday Indian foods raise heart disease risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how diet affects heart health, Dr Sunil Kumar Mandal, consultant cardiologist at Kailash Hospital, Greater Noida, warned that Indians are developing heart disease nearly 10–15 years earlier than Western populations, making &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/do-you-eat-a-meal-too-fast-it-might-be-time-to-slow-down-know-these-tips-for-mindful-eating-101745220968142.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="mindful eating"&gt;mindful eating&lt;/a&gt; essential. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;According to him, common staples such as deep-fried foods, refined carbohydrates like white rice and maida, and high-sodium items such as pickles and papads can raise cholesterol, spike blood sugar and increase blood pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;He advised prioritising a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains and healthy fats, along with portion control and healthier cooking methods like steaming and baking to protect heart health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Why winter months increase risk of heart attacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Rajesh T R, Director and Senior Consultant, Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery (CTVS) at KIMS Hospitals, Bengaluru, explained that winter weather can significantly strain heart health.&lt;/span&gt; Cold temperatures cause blood vessels to constrict, raising &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/blood-pressure" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and forcing the heart to work harder, while sudden exposure to cold can trigger spikes in heart rate and reduce oxygen supply, especially risky for those with blocked arteries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/12/10/550x309/heart_attack_winter3_1765369600816_1765369619874.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Winter heightens heart attack risks due to respiratory infections and unhealthy habits.(Image generated via Google Gemini)" title="Winter heightens heart attack risks due to respiratory infections and unhealthy habits.(Image generated via Google Gemini)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Winter heightens heart attack risks due to respiratory infections and unhealthy habits.(Image generated via Google Gemini)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Winter also increases the risk of respiratory infections, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating, and thicker blood, all of which elevate the chances of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;To reduce risk, he advised dressing warmly, staying physically active indoors, eating heart-healthy foods, staying hydrated, and closely managing existing conditions like hypertension and diabetes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Why heart attack symptoms in women often get missed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Sanjay Kumar, Senior Director of Cardiology at Fortis Hospital, Faridabad, explains that heart attack symptoms in women are often difficult to detect because they are usually subtle and atypical.&lt;/span&gt; “&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Women tend to have smaller coronary vessels and more diffuse plaque, which makes the disease harder to diagnose and increases the risk of recurrence,” he says, adding that, unlike men, women may not experience classic chest pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, warning signs can include jaw or upper &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/back-pain" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="back pain"&gt;back pain&lt;/a&gt;, nausea, palpitations, unexplained sweating, and breathlessness even during light activity, symptoms that are often mistaken for stress, acidity, or fatigue. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;He emphasises that while these signs may overlap with other conditions, experiencing one or more should prompt a timely medical evaluation to rule out underlying heart disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. What slow heart rate (bradycardia) means for your health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Dilip Kumar, Senior Interventional Cardiologist and Device Specialist at Manipal Hospital, Kolkata, explains that bradycardia is a condition in which the heart consistently beats slower than 60 beats per minute, which can be concerning as it may reduce the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the body.&lt;/span&gt; “While a slow &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/womans-entire-skin-peels-off-like-a-snake-after-a-spider-bite-my-heart-rate-was-stuck-between-140-160-for-days-101766048478518.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart rate"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt; can be normal in athletes, in others it may point to a problem with the heart’s electrical system,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/10/05/550x309/slow_heart_rate_1759631860553_1759631869382.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="While an abnormal heart rhythm with a fast heart rate can range from mild to life-threatening, often people ignore a slow heart rate.

(Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Older adults, people with heart disease, diabetes or kidney issues, and those on certain medications are at higher risk and should be cautious. Common warning signs include persistent fatigue, dizziness, fainting spells, breathlessness during mild activity, and chest discomfort. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Although not all causes are preventable, Dr Kumar notes that a heart-healthy lifestyle, stress management, and regular medical check-ups can help lower the risk and detect issues early.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Festive indulgence and its hidden impact on heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Abhijit Khadtare, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-with-40-years-experience-reveals-the-1-number-resting-heart-quietly-reveals-how-strong-your-heart-really-is-101766370110581.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cardiologist"&gt;cardiologist&lt;/a&gt; at Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, shared that while festive celebrations are not inherently dangerous, the drastic lifestyle changes that often come with them can pose serious risks for people with heart disease and diabetes. He noted that hospitals typically witness a post-holiday rise in emergency admissions related to heart attacks, uncontrolled blood sugar levels and blood pressure crises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;According to him, common festive challenges include overeating foods high in sugar, salt and saturated fats, disrupted sleep and medication routines, alcohol consumption, and emotional exhaustion from socialising and travel, all of which can strain the heart and upset metabolic balance even over a short period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Men are mostly diagnosed with skin cancer, and cancer of lungs, prostate, bladder and colon. The most frequent cancers in elderly women are breast cancer, skin cancer and colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The main reason for the rise is the increasingly elderly population, researchers said. If the accelerated rise materialises, some 32,600 people over 80 will be diagnosed with cancer in 2032. In 2019, that number was 18,700.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elderly patients are less likely to profit from new, systemic therapies, such as immunotherapy and targeted treatment, the research showed. “This group makes other decisions when it comes to treatment, and that is logical. We need to find the right balance between quality of life and life extension,” senior researcher Melinda Schuurman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing number of cancer sufferers will put more pressure on the health system because they will also present other health problems. “We need more research to predict which treatment benefits individual patients, enabling patients and their doctors to decide on the most suitable treatment,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;&lt;div class="bg-green-light p-3 mx-4 mt-8 mb-12"&gt;&lt;h6 class="h3 pt-0 text-serif text-success"&gt; Thank you for donating to DutchNews.nl.&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p class="small"&gt; We could not provide the Dutch News service, and keep it free of charge, without the generous support of our readers.

    &lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holidays are approaching and case counts are surging, but quarantine orders are in full effect, and public health officials warn the spread of disease is ongoing. That’s how many Americans experienced December 2020 during the COVID pandemic, and it’s also how hundreds of people under quarantine—including more than 100 elementary school students—in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, have spent recent weeks as a measles outbreak has continued to grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county is the latest measles hotspot in a year that saw a large outbreak in West Texas—762 &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt; that included the deaths of two children—and ongoing outbreaks in southern &lt;a href="https://files.epi.utah.gov/Utah%20measles%20dashboard.html"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; and northern &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;. The United States has already had its worst year of measles cases in more than three decades. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;1,958&lt;/a&gt; confirmed cases as of December 16. The last time case counts reached 2,000 was in 1992. Annual infections have exceeded 1,000 only once in the 33 years between 1992 and 2025—when infections reached 1,274 in 2019.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    


&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles researchers and epidemiologists predict the virus will continue to spread in transmission chains possibly linked to the West Texas outbreak that began in January. If that occurs, the country could lose measles elimination status—an achievement secured 25 years ago marking the end of uninterrupted measles spread. The status is mainly a technical designation, but its loss would reflect backsliding in the public health fight against one of the most infectious diseases on earth and comes at a time when Trump administration officials are casting doubt on the safety of vaccines and pursuing an &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/vaccine-panel-hepatitis-b-recommendations-iconoclasts/"&gt;overhaul&lt;/a&gt; of the childhood immunization schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We do still have a large number of people in quarantine, and we expect that we will see further cases from those currently in quarantine,” Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist, said in a briefing last week. The Spartanburg outbreak has resulted in &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/friday-measles-update-dph-reports-9-new-measles-cases-upstate-bringing-outbreak-total-144"&gt;144 infections&lt;/a&gt; as of Friday, and 224 people are in quarantine, which lasts for 21 days. Most of the transmission in the Spartanburg outbreak has occurred in household or school settings, and thanks to the virus’s 11- to 12-day incubation period, quarantine numbers have served as a leading indicator of additional infections. Infections have been almost entirely among unvaccinated individuals, with a majority being young people between 5 and 17 years old.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html"&gt;measles vaccination coverage&lt;/a&gt; among kindergarteners is quite high, at 92.5 percent for the 2024-25 school year. The South Carolina outbreak has followed a pattern similar to other U.S. outbreaks over the last 25 years, taking hold in communities with concentrations of unvaccinated or undervaccinated individuals. More than &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/sites/scdph/files/2025-12/45_Day_Report_25-26_20251203.pdf"&gt;three dozen&lt;/a&gt; public and private schools in Spartanburg County have vaccination rates below 90 percent for state-required &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/sites/scdph/files/2025-06/Final-School-Law-Letter-2025-2026_20250646.pdf"&gt;immunizations&lt;/a&gt;, including the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The county has the highest rate—&lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/health-wellness/child-teen-health/school-vaccination-coverage-data/school-vaccination-coverage-and"&gt;8.2 percent&lt;/a&gt;–of religious exemptions from school vaccine requirements in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the cases have occurred in a Ukrainian and Eastern European immigrant community; the virus has circulated in a Slavic-language church and surrounding schools where rates for required &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/sites/scdph/files/2025-06/Final-School-Law-Letter-2025-2026_20250646.pdf"&gt;immunizations&lt;/a&gt;, including the measles vaccine, are well below the 95 percent threshold needed to interrupt the spread of the virus. Global Academy, a public charter school attended by many students from the Ukrainian community, was one of the first schools to see cases. Just &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/sites/scdph/files/2025-12/45_Day_Report_25-26_20251203.pdf"&gt;21 percent&lt;/a&gt; of students at the academy have the required vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. William Moss, an infectious disease epidemiologist and pediatrician at Johns Hopkins University, told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; that it’s challenging to predict the trajectory of measles cases, but if large outbreaks continue into next year, he said it would look a lot like what we have seen in 2025. He likened the spread to an initial forest fire casting off sparks. “Those sparks are infectious individuals, and they travel to other communities,” he said. “If one of those sparks lands in another community where there’s a larger proportion of unvaccinated or non-immune individuals, then we tend to get this larger outbreak.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s connectivity between communities and then the relative susceptibility within those communities,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that 2025’s flames could simply burn themselves out, but the greater the size and quantity of the fires, the more likely the country could experience a sustained spread of the disease and spikes among vulnerable clusters of people. While there have only been a handful of large outbreaks in 2025, 43 states have had one or more measles cases, and there have been 49 outbreaks of three or more related cases. Last year, there were only 16 outbreaks, and only 30 states had cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologists and researchers warn that endemic spread of measles could possibly return in the coming decades. A modeling &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833361"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the medical journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year estimated that the U.S. could experience more than 800,000 measles cases over the next 25 years if current vaccination rates in each state hold constant. Significantly, the study projected that if vaccination rates increased by just 5 percent, there would be fewer than 6,000 cases over the next quarter century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our 2025 JAMA study and recent measles outbreaks have all suggested that the U.S. is on a tipping point for measles returning to becoming commonplace,” Dr. Nathan Lo, a Stanford researcher who co-authored the study, told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the near term, Moss said that widespread transmission throughout the country is unlikely to emerge given the high level of population immunity. “We’re not going to go back yet to where we were in the prevaccine era or in the ’60s and ’70s,” he noted, “but we will probably have more frequent and larger outbreaks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), a regional branch of the World Health Organization, monitors and evaluates the elimination designation for countries in the Americas, including the U.S. in cooperation with national public health authorities. The assessment is &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other-health/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/"&gt;based on&lt;/a&gt; a totality of indicators about whether endemic or sustained measles transmission is occurring. A country can in theory maintain its elimination status while experiencing multiple independent outbreaks so long as there isn’t a continuous chain of transmission for 12 consecutive months. Trump administration officials have &lt;a href="https://x.com/HHS_Jim/status/1996961704417046752"&gt;emphasized&lt;/a&gt; that there is no evidence yet definitively linking the West Texas outbreak, which was declared over in August, to other ongoing outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it can be challenging to find definitive proof given the genetic similarities of the virus circulating not just in the U.S. but also Canada and Mexico. The regional concentration of outbreaks in the southwest, Moss argued, suggests that in the absence of definitive evidence, the outbreaks are likely linked. “The burden of proof is going to be on those who claim that this is not one large outbreak, that this is really several smaller outbreaks,” he said, adding that he expects there to be some debate over the technicalities if PAHO revokes the U.S. elimination status next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Elimination status depends on evidence of continuous transmission for 12 months, and our current assessment is that we have not met that criteria,” a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services said when &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; asked if the agency anticipates losing elimination status next year. Canada officially &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-11-2025-paho-calls-regional-action-americas-lose-measles-elimination-status"&gt;lost&lt;/a&gt; its elimination status last month; the country has had &lt;a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/"&gt;5,000 cases&lt;/a&gt; this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the designation is just that, and holding onto the status in January does not mean measles will become more or less prevalent in the coming years. “Whether we formally lose that elimination status, to me, isn’t even that important in the sense of we already know we’ve got a terrible, terrible problem on our hands,” Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5647002-measles-status-outbreaks-kennedy/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20don%E2%80%99t%20need%20to%20wait%20for%20one%20more%20smoke%20alarm%20to%20go%20off%20to%20know%20that%E2%80%99s%20happening%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Osterholm.%20%E2%80%9CWhether%20we%20formally%20lose%20that%20elimination%20status%2C%20to%20me%2C%20isn%E2%80%99t%20even%20that%20important%20in%20the%20sense%20of%20we%20already%20know%20we%E2%80%99ve%20got%20a%20terrible%2C%20terrible%20problem%20on%20our%20hands.%E2%80%9D%C2%A0"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health officials and doctors continue to emphasize that vaccination is the best way to stem the tide of new and ongoing outbreaks. Two doses of the MMR vaccine in advance of exposure is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html#:~:text=Two%20doses%20of%20MMR,97%25%20effective%20against%20measles"&gt;97 percent&lt;/a&gt; effective at preventing the disease. But receiving the vaccine within 72 hours after exposure can also still help protect against severe illness.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bell, the South Carolina epidemiologist, said she hopes people understand how vaccination enabled the country to end common measles transmission and how that historic success now contrasts with the picture in Spartanburg. “We are faced with ongoing transmission that we anticipate will go on for many more weeks, at least in our state,” she said, “and that could be avoided.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;

With technological advances and innovations, researchers and doctors have managed to support people’s well-being even over once fatal diseases. However, there are still some disorders that leave us quite unnerved when they strike — dementia being one of them. A common and disabling disease that affects the brain, dementia occurs when brain cells are damaged or die, leading to progressive declines in cognitive functions, mood, behavior, and personality. It’s an umbrella term used to describe a range of neurological conditions affecting the brain that worsen over time, and it remains one of the world’s most urgent public health challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are currently over 55 million people with dementia worldwide, with nearly 10 million new cases of dementia developing each year. The number of people with dementia is growing worldwide and is expected to triple by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Understanding the link between Magnesium and Vitamin D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With dementia rates climbing and no real cure in sight, researchers are turning their focus to simple lifestyle changes — especially what we eat — to keep our brains healthy as we age. Over the years, magnesium has become a hot topic when it comes to fighting this disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an essential mineral, involved in loads of things our bodies do every day, and it might help slow down brain aging and lower the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s hopeful and interesting about magnesium being a potential ally in the fight against dementia is that, unlike fancy medications or complicated treatments, you can get magnesium from everyday foods like leafy greens, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and beans. Sure, supplements are available too, but when it comes to supplements, it’s always better to consult a professional healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, here’s what looks promising from the research corner: new studies hint that getting more magnesium than usual could mean better brain structure, sharper thinking, and a lower chance of developing dementia as the years go by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="31651892" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="magnesium-and-dementia" source="keywords"&gt;Magnesium and dementia&lt;/keyword&gt;: Understanding the link&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what is magnesium, and why does your brain care?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, magnesium keeps hundreds of chemical reactions running smoothly in your body. It’s key for things like making energy, helping nerves fire, and managing blood sugar. You’ll find it naturally in lots of foods — those leafy greens, nuts, seeds, beans, and whole grains. Since the brain relies on a complicated web of chemical reactions, getting enough magnesium is important for good thinking and smooth communication between brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does research say&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big study with over 6,000 adults found that people who got more magnesium — about 550 mg a day or more — had healthier brains compared to folks who stuck closer to 350 mg. We’re talking bigger overall brain volume and fewer white matter lesions, which are both good signs for avoiding dementia and aging well. This research from the Neuroimaging and Brain Lab at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/eating-more-magnesium-each-day-keeps-dementia-at-bay" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The Australian National University (ANU)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; showed that people with higher magnesium intake had brains that looked a year younger than their actual age. This effect was especially noticeable in women after menopause, which could be thanks to magnesium’s anti-inflammatory powers. Now, although these results look good and show promise, experts stress that studies like this only establish the link — this is not direct proof that magnesium stops dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How magnesium may influence &lt;keyword id="20018982" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="brain-health" source="keywords"&gt;brain health&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists think the miracle mineral might work in a few ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It helps keep the brain’s structure solid. People with more magnesium tend to have bigger brains and less shrinkage — markers that go along with lower dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magnesium calms inflammation, which is tied to the start of diseases like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It keeps nerve signals firing properly and helps brain cells make energy, which are both crucial for learning and memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since some types of dementia are linked to blood flow problems in the brain, magnesium’s ability to help control blood pressure and blood sugar can offer extra protection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to incorporate magnesium into your daily diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to get more magnesium, you should *always* start with the food. Spinach, nuts, seeds, and whole grains are all great options, and they bring along other nutrients your brain loves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements are an option too, especially if you have trouble hitting your daily target with food alone. But healthcare providers usually recommend focusing on food first. In case you want to sign up for supplements, always check in with them before adding them to your diet, since too much magnesium can cause stomach issues or interact with certain medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 06:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>如果您有高血压，应避免的5种补充剂-健康：值得信赖和富有同理心的健康和保健信息</title><link>https://www.health.com/supplements-to-avoid-with-high-blood-pressure-11874436</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Managing hypertension (high blood pressure) is necessary to lower your risk of other health conditions, like heart attack or stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To best manage high blood pressure, you may need to avoid certain supplements because they can affect your blood pressure or make your blood pressure medication less effective.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supplements with GA can also interact with diuretics and blood pressure medications. The supplement may affect how well blood pressure medication works and raise your risk of side effects. Specifically, licorice root can raise sodium levels and lower potassium levels in your body. This effect, combined with a diuretic, can lead to dangerously &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/hypokalemia-symptoms-7966570" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low levels of potassium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have high blood pressure, it's best to avoid using products with licorice root.

Despite its historical use as a traditional medicine, the plant may dangerously interact with a variety of medications. St. John's wort weakens the effects of many medications, including some used to treat high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These interactions likely occur because St. John's wort blocks the medication from being absorbed in the body as it normally would.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bitter orange (&lt;em&gt;Citrus aurantium&lt;/em&gt;) is taken from the fruit or peel of a bitter orange. The fruit and its peel can be used to add flavor to drinks or aromas to perfumes. The bitter orange supplement is often used to help with weight loss and improve sports performance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bitter orange contains p-Synephrine, a type of stimulant similar to ephedrine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned ephedrine stimulants because they can cause health issues like stroke and heart attack.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Though bitter orange is not banned, it should be used with extreme caution.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies have shown that bitter orange supplements can raise blood pressure and heart rate. The supplement can also raise your risk for other serious side effects like stroke and heart attack.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, bitter orange found in food and drinks is not likely to affect your blood pressure or cause these side effects.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People may respond to certain supplements differently. Factors that may affect how you respond to a supplement include genetics, diet and nutrition, age, gut health, and overall health status. Take note of any side effects or symptoms you experience when starting a new supplement or vitamin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before starting any new vitamins or supplements, talk to your doctor. They can help you decide if the vitamin or supplement would be useful and safe for you to take. Your doctor can also compare the new supplement to all the medications, vitamins, and other supplements you already take to identify potential interactions.

Together they have helped identify, and therefore stem, potentially disastrous outbreaks of yellow fever in Nigeria, mpox in Sierra Leone and Marburg virus in Rwanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Few people have heard of Happi and Sabeti, yet they not only run a &lt;a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/pardis_sabeti_and_christian_happi_a_virus_detection_network_to_stop_the_next_pandemic" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;virus detection network to stop the next deadly pandemic&lt;/a&gt; but are also breaking down inequity between Africa and the global north by empowering African scientists to improve African lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Their project, Sentinel, is an early warning framework co-created by Nigeria’s Institute of Genomics and Global Health and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Housed inside the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases (ACEGID), the programme uses genomics, surveillance and sequencing technology to identify new pathogens and then packages the science so it is ready-made for governments to act on. Since its inception, Sentinel – initially funded by a TED-Audacious Project grant – has proved an extraordinarily effective idea, says its managing director, Dr Al Ozonoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b61836c0-c4fe-450a-b00f-7a358874664a" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;The laboratory at the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases were the Sentinel project is based.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Ajayi Oluwapelumi/AP&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While Happi’s work responding to critical outbreaks has saved lives, just as important, Ozonoff believes, is his “vision of African scientists working at the cutting edge of their fields to improve life for everyday Africans”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sentinel has trained more than 3,000 health professionals across 53 of Africa’s 54 countries in genomics so they too are better able to track, identify and respond to outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In light of global aid cuts, Happi had been worried about Sentinel’s survival. Development assistance for health is estimated to drop to $39.1bn by the end of 2025 as the US, UK and other countries reduce their overseas development funding. The MacArthur grant will allow Sentinel to train more academics and health professionals in harder to reach places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Happi, who starts each day with a prayer and a walk, recalls the first time he put the idea behind Sentinel to good use. It was 2014 and he got the middle-of-the-night phone call that, he says, “you never want to receive”. It was Nigeria’s ministry of health. There was a suspected case of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Ebola&lt;/a&gt; in Lagos. Could he confirm it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I got chills, goose pimples. I prayed that wasn’t going to be the case,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4960747b-315b-4bd0-b60b-70bb28647e68" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Happi holds a miniPCR Thermal Cycler, equipment used to amplify segments of DNA.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Pius Utomi Ekpei/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Happi drove to his rudimentary, at the time, two-room laboratory on Redeemer’s University campus, where he remains a professor, and said goodbye to his wife, Dr Anise Happi, deputy director of zoonotic research and surveillance at ACEGID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ebola, which within two years would kill more than 11,325 people in west Africa, had already claimed the lives of many healthcare workers. He did not know if he would see Anise or their three children again. “She told me: ‘I will pray for you. I know you’ll be back,’” Happi recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Working through the heat of the night, sodden in their own sweat and exposed to the deadly infection they were testing, Happi and his assistant were able to confirm within a matter of hours that Ebola had arrived in Nigeria. The country mobilised. Just 42 days later, Nigeria was able to declar itself &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/20/nigeria-ebola-crackdown-example-to-world" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Ebola free&lt;/a&gt;. Out of the confirmed 20 cases, eight people died. Each death a tragedy, but nothing like the scale that could have faced the country of 186 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="fae26f38-b34a-40d5-b3f6-0a081dd2bcfb" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;An information board form 2014 in Lagos’s Oshodi Heritage park reads ‘No Shaking !

From there, the idea – detection of pathogenic threats in real time while stopping diseases before they spread – grew. Build Health International (BHI), a non-profit that builds infrastructure in low-resource settings, upgraded Happi and Sabeti’s little lab to a state-of-the-art genomics centre – this time with air conditioning – and by 2020, when Covid hit, the team was well equipped to have the full genome within 48 hours of the first case arriving in Nigeria.

When it came to the MacArthur grant, however, a competition that involved an application process, the team knew they were one of five finalists, but winning in November still came as a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“My heartbeat accelerated so much that I couldn’t open my mouth. It was a shock,” he says. “I never dreamed that in my career I would have this kind of money at once.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When Happi called Ansara, his words were simple: “Get ready,” says Ansara – a nod to the infrastructure that may be needed as part of Sentinel’s mission to train more scientists and embed pandemic preparedness in public health systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are not going to be judged by just the fact that we got this money but [for] what we do with this money,” says Happi, who says it is time to put “500%” into the work. He and Sabeti have undoubtedly saved thousands of lives but he remains humble and focused on the lives still to save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f7e6b150-e653-4cbe-9dd8-871279dcf74a" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Anise and Christian Happi at the Time 100 Gala.

    &lt;p&gt;Darren’s first inkling that something was wrong came seven months earlier. He’d &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/09/17/urinary-tract-infections-symptom-prostate-cancer/"&gt;had trouble urinating&lt;/a&gt; and had consulted with a private GP via his workplace insurance. They recommended he visit his own GP for further investigations including a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/psa-test-prostate-cancer-guide/"&gt;prostate-specific antigen&lt;/a&gt; (PSA) blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had the uncomfortable DRE – digital rectal exam – and my GP saw my prostate was enlarged and rolled with that,” he explains. “There was a confidence in it not being malignant. I was under 50 and fit; there was no way it could have been cancer. I was diagnosed with either enlarged prostate or a bladder infection and sent on my way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darren’s story is emblematic of an issue with prostate cancer diagnosis which &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/prostate-cancer-screening-uk-call-to-action/"&gt;the Telegraph has been campaigning on&lt;/a&gt; throughout 2025. At this stage, a PSA test might well have been able to detect the cancer, but because the UK has no screening system, the test won’t be offered to men under 50 unless the patient specifically asks for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think my doctor’s flawed clinical reasoning probably came from the national policy around screening, but also a lack of confidence around contextualising a patient’s entire history,” says Darren. “Ultimately, my doctor was relatively inexperienced and was clearly afraid of creating health anxiety in me, afraid of having to send me to a urologist who might say I didn’t need the referral. But my father had prostate cancer and my mother had breast cancer which I’d told him. This family history makes me 2.5x more likely to get prostate cancer and it wasn’t factored into the reasoning when it came to my initial diagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he was diagnosed, Darren took solace in the counsel from his urologist that his cancer was likely to have been advanced by the time &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/prostate-health-cancer-how-to-check/"&gt;his first symptoms appeared&lt;/a&gt;. In his case, the delayed diagnosis was highly unlikely to have changed his outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would have been advanced and metastatic already by the time I could see any signs,” Darren says. “When you get this when you’re young, it’s usually aggressive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A “Gleason score” categorises how aggressive the cancer is on a scale from one to 10. The prognosis is more favourable if the score is below seven. Darren’s was nine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;‘The mistake will stay with him forever’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Honestly, I felt for my GP after I came back with my diagnosis,” Darren admits. “It’ll stay with him forever, that mistake. As I produced the investigation reports and consultant letters the GP’s disbelief and regret was profound. I understand he left the practice a few months later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Christmas was out of the way, Darren’s treatment began. He was put on bicalutamide, a medication which blocks testosterone from “feeding” the cancer and sent to an oncologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oncologist advised that he would be eligible for radical treatment in the form of radiotherapy to the prostate. “I’d done my research, and realised that since I was younger than average for a prostate cancer diagnosis, and very fit, I might tolerate the treatments better,” Darren explains. “We requested chemotherapy as a systemic treatment to kill any breakaway ‘cancer seeds’ which could have spread through the lymph and blood around the body where they could settle and start to grow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darren decided he could shoulder the potential side effects and chemotherapy was the way he wanted to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout his six chemotherapy cycles Darren was the picture of health. He competed in 10k races with Ruth, he played tennis regularly, he ran two miles from home to the hospital and back a few times. He even continued to work on his laptop while being infused with one of the strongest chemotherapy agents.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence suggests that the key to treating  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="186587" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; is catching it &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-signal-hidden-in-the-brain-may-reveal-alzheimers-years-in-advance"&gt;in its earliest stages&lt;/a&gt;. Now scientists have developed a promising new drug that seems to be effective at stalling the disease before it really gets started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is called NU-9, and a team from Northwestern University in the US tested it on mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. They found that it's able to significantly lower the levels of toxic protein molecules called amyloid beta oligomers, which can aggregate into the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;harmful plaque clumps&lt;/a&gt; associated with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With NU-9 deployed, far fewer of these oligomers were detected in the mouse brains. This in turn kept brain support cells &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/genetic-tweaks-in-astrocytes-could-be-key-to-alzheimers-treatment"&gt;called astrocytes&lt;/a&gt; in a calmer, healthier state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microdosing-cannabis-pauses-alzheimers-decline-in-unprecedented-trial"&gt;Microdosing Cannabis Pauses Alzheimer's Decline in Unprecedented Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results are stunning," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/12/nu-9-halts-alzheimers-disease-in-animal-model-before-symptoms-begin"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurobiologist William Klein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NU-9 had an outstanding effect on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrogliosis"&gt;reactive astrogliosis&lt;/a&gt;, which is the essence of neuroinflammation and linked to the early stage of [Alzheimer's] disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study wasn't just about examining the impact of NU-9, though: it was also about improving our understanding of how Alzheimer's develops, long before any symptoms appear, which is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-distinct-patterns-may-signal-alzheimers-according-to-science"&gt;likely to be crucial&lt;/a&gt; in researching new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186590" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186590" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/NeuronProgress.jpg" alt="Neuron progress diagram" class="wp-image-186590 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/NeuronProgress.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/NeuronProgress-600x630.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186590" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tracked the growing influence of amyloid beta oligomers (green) and their influence on reactive astrocytes (red). (Kranz et al., &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mice used in the study, the researchers discovered a previously unknown subtype of amyloid beta oligomer. They called it ACU193&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and found it was one of the first to show up in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stress-sensitive-neurons-may-have-a-powerful-effect-on-our-entire-brain"&gt;stressed neurons&lt;/a&gt;, attaching itself to astrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While astrocytes are crucial to a smoothly operating brain, they can also become dangerous if they get overactive. The scientists behind the study think ACU193&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; could trigger this transition – and give us a potential way to slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alzheimer's disease begins decades before its symptoms appear, with early events like toxic amyloid beta oligomers accumulating inside neurons and glial cells becoming reactive long before memory loss is apparent," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/12/nu-9-halts-alzheimers-disease-in-animal-model-before-symptoms-begin"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Northwestern neuroscientist Daniel Kranz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By the time symptoms emerge, the underlying pathology is already advanced. This is likely a major reason many &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-might-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-expert-says"&gt;clinical trials have failed&lt;/a&gt;. They start far too late."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth bearing in mind that there's still a way to go before we can be sure that amyloid beta – in either oligomer or plaque form – is directly driving Alzheimer's. It's probable that multiple triggers and factors &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-cause-of-alzheimers-might-be-coming-from-inside-your-mouth"&gt;are involved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NU-9 has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2402117122"&gt;previously been shown&lt;/a&gt; to prevent amyloid beta oligomer build-up in human brain cells in the lab, so is encouraging to see that it seems to also work in live animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More testing is now underway: the researchers are looking at how effective NU-9 is in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease in a later stage of progression, which is thought to better reflect how it takes hold in people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/reducing-your-bioenergetic-age-may-ward-off-alzheimers-study-finds"&gt;as they age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only after all that could it potentially progress to human  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="186587" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all goes as hoped, NU-9 could become a preventative treatment that can be taken by people at high risk of developing Alzheimer's later in life. The researchers compare it to cholesterol-lowering drugs that are taken to reduce the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-protein-is-a-better-predictor-of-heart-disease-than-cholesterol"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If someone has a biomarker signaling Alzheimer's disease, then they could start taking NU-9 before symptoms appear," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/12/nu-9-halts-alzheimers-disease-in-animal-model-before-symptoms-begin"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Klein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are a couple of early diagnostic blood tests for Alzheimer's disease in development. The promise of better early diagnostics – combined with a drug that could stop the disease in its tracks – is the goal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70968"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It was a label I’d only recently acquired. A year ago, it had seemed silly to obtain government proof of what we’d known to be true for six years: We were life partners. Now I was so grateful we signed that piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier that morning, I’d driven my husband to an ER in Torrance for what we’d assumed was a nasty flu or its annoying bacterial equivalent. We’d imagined a round of industrial-grade antibiotics, and then heading home in time for our 3-year-old’s usual bath-time routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the doctor’s face was serious. Machines beeped and whirred as my husband laid on the hospital bed. Whatever supernatural power colloquially known as a “gut feeling” flat-lined in my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s leukemia,” she said, putting a clinical end to what had been our honeymoon period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only six months earlier, a female Elvis impersonator had declared us husband and wife. A burlesque dancer pressed her cleavage into both of our faces as our friends cheered and threw dollar bills. A wedding in Vegas was my idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two years of dating Marty, a cute roller hockey player with an unwavering moral compass, I knew I wanted to have a child with him. It was marriage, not commitment, that unnerved me. I wanted romance, freedom and to do things my way. The word “wife” induced an allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Marty and I became parents and navigated adulthood together, my resistance to matrimony started to feel like an outdated quirk. The emotional equivalent of a person still rocking a septum piercing long after they stopped listening to punk music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marty had shown me, over and over, what it was to be a teammate. He’d rubbed my back through hours of labor, made late-night runs for infant Tylenol and was never afraid to cry at the sad parts of movies or take the occasional harsh piece of feedback about his communication style. And like all good teams, we kicked ass together. So why was I still resisting something that meant so much to him? To our family?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One random Saturday, at the Hawthorne In-N-Out Burger, after Marty ordered fries as a treat for our son, I finally said, “Screw it. Let’s get married.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wedding day was raucous and covered in glitter. We both wore white. Our son’s jacket had a roaring tiger stitched onto the back and was layered over his toddler-size tuxedo T-shirt. Loved ones from all over the country flew to meet us in a tiny pink chapel. A neon heart buzzed over our heads as we vowed to “love each other in sickness and in health, till death do us part.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t have imagined then that the next chapel I’d be in would be the hospital prayer room. Or that I would have begged a God I struggle to believe in to please spare Marty’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike our decision to marry, acute leukemia came on suddenly. Over the course of a few weeks, Marty’s bone marrow had flooded his blood with malignant cells. Treatment was urgent. He was taken by ambulance from the ER to the City of Hope hospital in Duarte, a part of Los Angeles County we’d never had a reason to visit before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally the 50th wedding anniversary is celebrated with gold, the 25th with silver and the first with paper. But we couldn’t even afford to look paper-far-ahead anymore. Instead, we celebrated that the specific genetic modifiers of Marty’s cancer were treatable, the good chemo days and his being able to walk to the hospital lobby to see our son for the first time in weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leukemia has taught me things such as: how to inject antifungal medication into the open PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter) line in Marty’s veins, how to explain to our son that “Papa will be sleeping with the doctors for a long while so they can help him feel better” and that to do the hibbity-dibbity with a person going through chemo, you must wear a condom. But mostly my husband’s sickness has taught me about healthy love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we had a child together, we’d committed to being in each other’s lives forever. But marriage was different. We’d already made a promise to our son, but when we got married, we made one to each other and ourselves. We had gone all in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since his diagnosis two months ago, there have been so many ways we’ve shown love for each other. People assume that I would do all the caregiving, but it’s more than that. Yes, I’ve washed my husband’s feet when he couldn’t bend down, been the only parent at preschool dropoff and pickup, and advocated on Marty’s behalf to his health insurance with only a few choice expletives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But my husband has also taken care of me. Even when he was nauseous, sweating and fatigued, Marty showed up. He made me laugh with macabre jokes about how the only way for us to watch anything other than “PAW Patrol” on TV together was for him to get hospitalized. He insisted that I make time to rest and bring him the car owner’s manual, so he could figure out why the check engine light had come on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d promised in front of our closest friends and Elvis herself to love each other “for better or worse.” And when the worst arrived sooner than expected, we did more than love. We truly cared for each other as husband and wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The author is a writer whose short stories have been nominated for the PEN/Robert J.

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I ghosted one of my best friends from high school. I loved her like a sister, and we had a lot of fun, but she was a pathological liar and constantly needed attention. If I was talking about something important or serious or even telling a story, a lot of times she would steer the convo back to her. She would also make up stories to go along with the topic we’re talking about, which I began to notice when she started contradicting something she said previously or would make up details in stories where I was with her. Honestly, it was a bit exhausting, but she really was a good friend and wasn’t actively trying to be toxic."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"We grew apart in college, but still tried talking whenever we could. However, the final straw was when my mom passed away from cancer. She knew how close I was with my family and knew about my mom’s diagnosis, but never reached out in any form. She later tagged me on Instagram for a giveaway she wanted to enter. I will never forget that. Cut off contact swiftly."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/originalhedgehog71"&gt;&lt;b&gt;originalhedgehog71&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chicago dog under observation for biting an individual tested positive for rabies, the state’s first confirmed canine case in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, the dog bit an individual on December 11, and was held in accordance with state law.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Due to the dog’s behavior, it was euthanized on December 18, and tested positive for rabies on December 19 at a Chicago laboratory, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the IDPH, the dog was the first in the state to test positive for rabies since 1994, and is the first to test positive in Cook County since at least 1964.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dog had been vaccinated for rabies in June after it was adopted as part of a litter of puppies transported from a Florida rescue to Chicago in May of this year, according to officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dog had behavioral issues throughout its life, which became worse in December, including growling, snapping, increased barking and anxiety, according to the IDPH press release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dog had been vaccinated for rabies and rabies wasn’t initially suspected, but after the animal was euthanized it tested positive via direct fluorescent antibody testing last week.&lt;/p&gt;
			
	
&lt;p&gt;It is currently being investigated what strain of rabies the dog had been infected with, according to officials. Bats are the lone known reservoir for animal rabies in the state, with the last skunk known to have tested positive for the illness in 1998 and the last raccoon to test positive for rabies in 1983.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the dog was vaccinated, it is possible the animal was exposed to a rabid animal prior to that vaccination. The typical incubation period for rabies in dogs is 20-to-60 days, but symptoms can develop up to a year after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDPH and IDPH are evaluating people who were in contact with the dog to determine if rabies post-exposure treatment should be recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any dog that is up-to-date on rabies vaccinations and was in contact with the rabid dog at a doggy day care it was housed at should get a booster shot, and should be quarantined at home for 45 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include restlessness, aggression, excessive slobbering, lethargy, weakness, hypersensitivity, and hydrophobia, according to IDPH.&lt;/p&gt;

"Simple actions like staying home when you're sick and calling ahead before seeking medical care help protect others, especially during a busy time of year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah has reported 125 measles cases statewide this year, as of Dec. 16, which is the most cases in a year in &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51418140" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;more than three decades&lt;/a&gt;, according to state epidemiologist Dr. Leisha Nolen. An updated statewide count is expected to be released Tuesday at 3 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of Utah's confirmed cases are found in southwestern Utah, according to the state's &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, with a growing number reported in counties in northern Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can remain airborne and on surfaces for up to two hours after an infected person has left the area. Symptoms often include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complications of the disease can lead to blindness and death for those with compromised immune systems, young children and adults over the age of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of the disease, and say that herd immunity requires a 95% vaccination rate. About 90% of Utahns are vaccinated against measles, according to Nolen and Dorothy Adams, a Salt Lake County health expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 2,000 cases of measles have been confirmed nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the highest number since the disease was considered &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51409430" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help prevent the spread of measles, Utah County health officials urge Utahns to take the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay home when sick, especially if a fever or rash is present.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Call ahead before seeking medical care if measles is suspected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

So much flu,” said Dr. Debra Langlois, a pediatrician at University of Michigan Health C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital in Ann Arbor. “We are inundated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d9ef6" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. John Schieffelin, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, is also seeing a surge in bad cases, particularly among kids who haven’t had their flu shots.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-16ddc1" class="body-graf"&gt;“The kids who are vaccinated are doing just fine” recovering at home, Schieffelin said. “It’s the unvaccinated children that we’re seeing in the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-4d01b8" class="body-heading"&gt;Flu symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c63cd4" class="body-graf"&gt;Langlois said she and her colleagues are seeing a fair amount of classic flu symptoms: fevers, body aches and extreme fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f022d0" class="body-graf"&gt;Anecdotally, Langlois said that she’s also seeing kids with severe headaches and dizziness. Her 7-year-old daughter had the flu last week and described the feeling like this: “I feel dizzy, like I’m spinning when I’m trying to walk.” Dehydration was the likely cause, Langlois said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-298284" class="body-graf"&gt;Some kids may also experience gastrointestinal issues like vomiting and diarrhea. But those symptoms could also arise because of a secondary virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a4e851" class="body-graf"&gt;Children who have “persistent” fevers lasting two to three days, Langlois said, should be seen by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ed5d3f" class="body-heading"&gt;Is Tamiflu available?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-65e4f1" class="body-graf"&gt;Pharmacies say demand for the antiviral drug Tamiflu is also increasing. When given within the first 24 hours or so of flu symptoms, the drug has been shown to make people feel better about a day earlier than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-507073" class="body-graf"&gt;A Walgreens spokesperson said the pharmacy chain is seeing “very high demand” for Tamiflu nationwide. The company recently saw its supply run low but has since ordered additional stock, the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59dc08" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the Walgreens Respiratory Index — a weekly online tool that tracks the spread of respiratory illnesses — demand for over-the-counter at-home flu tests has jumped 61% nationwide over the last two weeks. In New York state, where flu activity is considered very high, according to the CDC, week over week demand is up 23%, while the two week increase stands at 111%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3ccfc4" class="body-graf"&gt;Antonio Ciaccia, president of 3 Axis Advisory, a consulting firm focused on addressing supply chain issues, said he’s hearing from a number of independent pharmacies across the U.S. who say they’re struggling to meet demand for Tamiflu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6986a3" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are seeing an early heavy wave of flu cases, which is likely pushing a bit of unexpected pressure on the broader drug distribution channel and its supply,” Ciaccia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8566bb" class="body-graf"&gt;Steve Moore, who runs an independent pharmacy in Plattsburgh, New York, said his primary supplier is not experiencing shortages of Tamiflu. His backup supplier, however, is currently out of stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4b55a" class="body-graf"&gt;While Tamiflu can be helpful, Langlois said it’s no “miracle cure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-05cdca" class="body-graf"&gt;The antiviral is authorized for people 2 weeks and older, and is generally &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/bad-flu-cdc-reports-us-high-high-flu-levels-rcna57849" target="_blank"&gt;most effective&lt;/a&gt; when given within the first 48 hours of flu symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aab29c" class="body-graf"&gt;“The thing to think about for Tamiflu is that it shortens the duration of symptoms by about a day,” Langlois said. “It’s really best reserved for high-risk patients, like patients with chronic lung disease, and young kiddos under age 2.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-e6d25d" class="body-heading"&gt;If you're sick, stay home&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e447bb" class="body-graf"&gt;“The best thing is prevention,” Langlois said, “and that’s getting your flu shot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4cbbb2" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC recommends annual flu vaccines for everyone 6 months and older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-550c9f" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors worry that kids who are sick with flu now could spread it to grandparents and other older adults over the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11c08f" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“At the risk of being a Grinch, if you have the flu and you actively have fevers, then you should stay home.

&lt;p&gt;Flu season has arrived, and with it a variant making headlines as a “super flu.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A variant of influenza A H3N2 called subclade K is being blamed for an early and severe flu season in the United Kingdom, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj.r2602" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;journal of the British Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The strain has made its way across the Atlantic and is now the dominant strain in the U.S., responsible for very high levels of flu in New York, Rhode Island, Colorado and Louisiana, and high levels in multiple states, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/usmap.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;“The United Kingdom got hit pretty hard by this,” as did Europe and Australia, said &lt;a href="https://bouve.northeastern.edu/directory/neil-maniar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neil Maniar&lt;/a&gt;, director of the master of public health program at Northeastern University. “I think that’s a pretty good harbinger of what we are likely to see here. This is going to be a very difficult flu season.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The currently dominant flu strain can lead to “some pretty serious illness,” he said. “The other concern is that it’s not very well aligned with the vaccine this year, which means there is potentially a larger proportion of the population that is susceptible to the flu.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brandon Dionne, a Northeastern University associate clinical professor in pharmacy and health systems sciences, said the issue is that the influenza strain went through multiple mutations in the hemagglutinin surface proteins that are used to trigger antibody responses in vaccine production.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Because of this, the vaccine isn’t quite as good of a match for the virus as for the H3N2 strain that was used to develop it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flu vaccines usually have an efficacy rate of 40% to 60%. But an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12639273/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;early report&lt;/a&gt; from the United Kingdom estimates an efficacy rate of 32% to 39% in adults, and 72% to 75% in children, based on reductions in hospitalizations, Dionne said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the mismatch, it’s important to get the flu vaccine, Maniar said. “One of the important goals of the flu vaccine is to reduce the severity of illness if you do get the flu.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/hcp/acip/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; that people 6 months old and above get the flu vaccine. While the federal health agency recommended it be administered in September or October, Maniar said it’s not too late to get vaccinated now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you haven’t done so, get (the vaccine),” he said. “Definitely get it as we go into the holidays, as we go into new year’s and the new school year,” he said. Maniar said it takes about two weeks to build up a solid immune response, but within several days, people start to develop some immunity.&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;If people do develop the flu, treatment is the same as for other influenza viruses, Dionne said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is an oral medication that is most effective when started as soon as possible after symptom onset,” he said. “It typically helps to shorten the duration of symptoms by about 12 to 24 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tamiflu is sometimes used in high-risk patients, such as nursing home residents, even before flu symptoms develop, Dionne said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There are home testing kits for flu A and B combined with COVID-19,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of influenza include cough, headache, muscle aches, fatigue and sweating and chills, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maniar said he didn’t know if the current variant “is necessarily more virulent” than other years. The fears are that it will be more widespread, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC says there have been 4.6 million cases of flu, including 49,000 hospitalizations and 1,900 deaths — including two among children — this flu season.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This can be a very serious illness. We need to take it seriously, and we need to take measures to protect ourselves,” Maniar said. “As we go deeper into the flu season, this is likely to be a tough one.”&lt;/p&gt;
