At 28, she had taken on a unit in Chester to convert into a yoga studio, poured in all her savings and hired teachers, while at the same time working as a personal trainer. Her days started at 5am; she was driven, stressed, excited, and had no time for the back pain that just would not subside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It kept moving around,” she says. “Every day it would be in a different part of my back. I was strapping on heat packs and ice packs just to get to work.” Smith saw her GP, her physiotherapist and a chiropractor, all of whom suspected a torn muscle. “What really worried me,” she says, “the worst-case scenario, was a slipped disc.” One day in March 2020, the pain was so intense that Smith took to her bed, fell asleep and woke with a crashing migraine and blurred vision. Her mum took her to the optician who shone a light behind Smith’s eyes, saw haemorrhaging and sent her straight to the hospital. Once there, Smith was admitted, and over the course of a week, had an MRI, a CT scan, and a biopsy taken from the cells in her back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/lung-cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Lung cancer"},{"id":"society/cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Cancer"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"society/youngpeople","type":"Keyword","title":"Young people"},{"id":"environment/air-pollution","type":"Keyword","title":"Air pollution"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/anna-moore","type":"Contributor","title":"Anna Moore"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/g2","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"G2"},{"id":"theguardian/g2/features","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Comment &amp;amp; features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-features","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-production","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 production"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/sep/14/lung-cancer-young-fit-non-smoking-women","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smith was alone in her bed when two doctors appeared, closed the curtains, and told her that she had cancer in her lungs that had spread down her spine and up into her brain. It was stage four. “They said there was nothing they could do for me,” says Smith. “All I remember is ringing my mum and screaming down the phone. The doctors told my parents that I probably had about two weeks to live.” This was the early days of Covid, and Smith chose to go home for palliative care. “I think I’ve blocked a lot of it out, as you do when you go through trauma,” says Smith. “My friends all came to say goodbye. They were sitting at the end of my bed crying their eyes out. I’ve still got a whole book of the letters they wrote me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="72976a7b-8a38-4cc5-8926-df6ead2255a9" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Becca Smith had planned to open a yoga studio before she became ill. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Handout&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For decades, lung cancer has been viewed as a disease of older men, a “smokers’ disease”, heavily stigmatised and until very recently, grossly underfunded. &lt;a href="https://www.icr.ac.uk/research-and-discoveries/cancer-blogs/detail/science-talk/let-s-work-together-to-end-the-stigma-around-lung-cancer#:~:text=The%20stigma%20around%20the%20disease,account%20the%20burden%20of%20disease." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;One analysis from 2010&lt;/a&gt; found it received only 6% of cancer research funding, despite being the &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/lung-cancer#lung_stats0" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;third most common cancer in the UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In recent years though, the patient profile has shifted. Smoking remains the main risk factor, but cases among fit, young, non-smoking women have risen, both as a proportion and in absolute numbers. And while screening is now available in England for those over 55 with a history of smoking – &lt;a href="https://roycastle.org/the-devil-is-in-the-detail-our-response-to-the-10-year-health-plan/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;76% of the lung cancer cases identified by screening are at stage one or two and &lt;/a&gt;potentially curable – young, non-smoking women like Smith tend to be diagnosed only after the cancer has spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Alex Georgiou, a consultant medical oncologist at Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospital, has analysed the data of his lung cancer patients to understand these changes. “Between 2010 and 2021, the number of patients at our clinic who haven’t smoked has increased every year,” he says. “In 2010, it was 5% of cases. By 2021, it was 14%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Of these non-smoking lung cancer cases, 68% were women, compared with 43% of those with a history of smoking. There was also a higher proportion of younger patients: 16% of the non-smoking patients were aged below 50 compared with 5% from the smoking group – and more Black and Asian patients too. White people made up 72% of the smoking cases, compared with just 44% of the non-smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We might expect a high proportion of Asian patients, as non-smoking lung cancer is very prevalent in south-east Asia,” says Georgiou. “But the higher number of black patients is less recognised. They made up 17% of the non-smoking cases versus 5% from the group with a smoking history.” There were also clear differences in stage of presentation and disease progression. Two-thirds of the non-smoking patients presented at stage four, the most advanced stage, and 38% had cancer that had spread to the brain. “It’s not only that the demographics are different,” says Georgiou. “The biology of the cancer is different too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These findings reflect worldwide trends but, as yet, none of it is fully understood. According to Cecilia Pompili, a thoracic surgeon and clinical senior lecturer at Hull York Medical School, we are just beginning to ask the questions. “For so long, we didn’t think of lung cancer as a disease of young women and often haven’t even included them in clinical research trials,” she says. (For example, &lt;a href="https://www.lungcancerstoday.com/post/dr-narjust-florez-on-the-reality-of-lung-cancer-in-women" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;men have made up 65% of participants&lt;/a&gt; in groundbreaking immunotherapy trials for lung cancer.) Pompili is interviewing women with lung cancer about their early symptoms and diagnosis pathway, for a study funded by the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Adenocarcinoma is the most common lung cancer diagnosed in non-smokers, and while some women experience the “classic” persistent cough, and also coughing up blood, for others, symptoms are more vague and non-specific, such as weight loss, or back pain. “We want to understand the symptom trajectory and also whether women are treated differently by their health provider,” says Pompili. “We know from some patients that a 40-year-old, fit woman with a persistent cough is more likely to be diagnosed with an allergy, asthma or an infection than an older male smoker who will be sent for a chest X-ray.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Identifying why lung cancer is rising in women requires much more research, says Pompili. Hormones could play a part. Worldwide, indoor air pollution caused by wood-burning stoves and biomass fuels used for cooking and heating has been identified as a significant risk factor. In the UK, &lt;a href="https://roycastle.org/learn-about-lung-cancer/lung-cancer-risk-factors/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;outdoor air pollution is believed to cause around one in 10 lung cancers&lt;/a&gt;. “Air pollution has been demonstrated to be significant for both genders, especially in younger patients,” says Pompili. It’s possible that women’s smaller lungs and narrower airways lead to a higher concentration of pollutants and a greater likelihood of fine particulate matter – 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter – becoming trapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, whose nine-year-old daughter Ella was the first person in the world to have air pollution listed as a cause of death on her death certificate, is not surprised. “Ella had asthma but there are 700 diseases impacted by air pollution,” she says. “When I think of younger women with lung cancer, I wonder about the school run, the time sitting in cars or buses in heavy traffic. When I think about the higher number of black and brown people, I think of economics. Who takes buses, and waits at bus stops, and lives in social housing and cheaper housing close to main roads?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“London is the most congested city in Europe. Worldwide, we are number five,” continues Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who campaigns for cleaner air through the &lt;a href="https://www.ellaroberta.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Ella Roberta Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. “Yet somehow, officially, Ella is still the only person who has died because of air pollution. We’ve got to the point where the burden of ill health caused by air pollution is so huge, I’m asking myself: ‘What will it take to make the public demand more action?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Also key here – but again, not fully understood – is the role of genetic mutations, especially in younger non-smoking women. Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are the most common, &lt;a href="https://www.egfrpositive.org.uk/what-is-egfr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;believed to cause 10-15% of lung cancers in the UK&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2022-09-10_scientists-reveal-how-air-pollution-can-cause-lung-cancer-in-people-who-have-never-smoked" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; has identified how air pollution might “wake up” dormant cells in the lungs that carry these cancer-causing mutations, promoting their growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sarah Li, a 42-year-old freelance film-maker, was diagnosed with EGFR-positive lung cancer last year. A non-smoker and a vegan, Li lives in London and was signed up for her seventh marathon at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I’d had a persistent cough but I wasn’t worried,” she says. “I’d had a cold first and the cough just seemed to come off the back of it.” Li was also experiencing pain in her right shoulder. “Looking back, that was another symptom but I didn’t know enough to join the dots.” A physio suggested shoulder exercises and a pharmacist sold Li syrup for her cough. After four months though, as the cough worsened, Li saw her GP, expecting antibiotics for a chest infection. Instead, she was referred for a chest X-ray, then fast-tracked for a CT scan. In April 2024, Li learned she had inoperable lung cancer, with a tumour on her left lung, and cancer also present in nodules in her right lung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Even now, I find it strange when I say I have lung cancer,” says Li. “I can say I have cancer – so many people get cancer – but the idea of lung cancer still feels quite foreign. How am I the face of lung cancer? When I was first diagnosed, I went through everything, asking: ‘Why? What did I do?’ I think I led a healthy lifestyle, but I lived in India for four years, in Hyderabad, a busy city. I feel strange blaming any one thing or focusing on what I might have done wrong. Nobody wants this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8bb545b7-c72b-42d1-bad6-a93d4588e814" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Sarah Li was diagnosed with lung cancer last year.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Although Li had only been with her partner Robin for 18 months, they had to have difficult conversations about fertility and future children. “Did I want to freeze my eggs before treatment? We decided it was better to keep me alive and start treatment as soon as possible.” In fact, the impact of lung cancer on fertility has only just become an area of research. The International Pregnancy and Lung &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Registry was launched in December 2023. “Understanding how lung cancer and its treatment impacts young women in all ways – their whole lives, their fertility, their young family and caring responsibilities, their career, is only just beginning,” says Pompili. “It’s something we have done for breast cancer – but not lung cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After years of underfunding (widely attributed to lung cancer’s link with smoking), pioneering treatments are developing fast – especially for cancers like Li’s, driven by genetic mutations. In the last decade, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has &lt;a href="https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/nices-increasing-cancer-treatment-recommendations#:~:text=Since%202015%2C%20NICE%20has%20made,immune%20system%20to%20combat%20cancer." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommended 48 new treatments&lt;/a&gt; for lung cancer – six times more than in the previous decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Li’s first round of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy led to massive reductions in her tumours. However, in January, a small lesion was found on her brain. She is now having a targeted therapy – a daily pill – and more chemo. “Life is more intense now,” she says. “There’s more vividness to everything. Like today, I’m just so happy that I’m feeling well enough to be outside, to have a nice lunch. Those little things you take for granted … you’re just way more appreciative of it all. The idea of talking about ‘two years’ time’ or ‘five years’ time’ like my friends do? I can’t. I know that eventually the cancer will outsmart the treatment I’m on. Hopefully, by then, there’ll be another treatment pathway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smith is in the same position. A few weeks into her palliative care, the family were informed by phone that the biopsy taken from Smith’s back showed a genetic mutation, ALK-positive lung cancer, and a treatment was available. She began taking eight tablets a day – targeted cancer drugs, ALK inhibitors – with monthly blood tests and scans every three months. “It went well, there was a big reduction in cancer,” she says. “After two years, I got some progression in my brain, so I’m on the second line of treatment now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Explaining her disease to others is exhausting. “You always get the same reaction,” she says. “‘But you don’t smoke?’ ‘You’re so young?’ There’s such a community around breast cancer – more power to it – but with lung cancer, there really isn’t. It feels like it’s just you.” This is despite the fact that the disease &lt;a href="https://www.lungcancerresearchfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/Women-Fact-Sheet-2024.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;kills as many women&lt;/a&gt; as breast, ovarian and cervical cancers combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smith is a pilates teacher now – this summer, she went on a yoga retreat in Bali. Her partner, Sammy, flew out to join her in July and, during a walk on the beach, he proposed. “This is my dream. I’m enjoying my life,” she says. “I’ve gone through so much. I lost the yoga studio, I lost a lot of money, but the things you think matter? They really don’t. All I care about is my family and friends, and being happy and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I still feel sadness and I’m scared – I’m terrified because I don’t know what’s to come,” she continues. “Scans never get easier, but you get better at dealing with them. It’s a cliche but I genuinely live for today now – and five years on, I’ve finally reached a stage where I can be grateful for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOa2dBWngtTDM2Q2hnc0kzNXI4UE9OVzcwS1ZGQmpFQjNYenI0X0xVZkp6bnp4QVYzWHdJVkJEOFU4c3otVWw5WHBMNzF6MHB3SEcxSWFHN1FGYnA5Yk9WNTBYdGc2amdIN0sxSnVoUU9lYWlaUlNDeXBfd0VMY0xvTEN0M1FtLWJUSmdLNWdSczY</guid></item><item><title>特朗普政府如何瓦解美国的癌症研究系统-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/14/magazine/trump-administration-cancer.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 12:31:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOaHM2ZTdHZEczYVZqcTl1eUhzaWdnRTh3TThWVG5VUmxiYkczVUduTGZvNTY3WlV4SV9kcU5lUzk5VDNMNl9CanlTOW9fZ0NWY2xBWU9uZ2VsQ2lMeVI3aklJb3c3QjJ4TGwyZEFPZENhaXJWWS1QdWdTNGRRbDF2Y1dB</guid></item><item><title>新父母建议：我们即将收养一个小男孩。人们对此的反应真的让我失望。- slate.com</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/09/new-parent-advice-adoption-reactions.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb3uuc00123b7azxhalliw@published"&gt;My spouse and I are on a difficult journey through infertility struggles. We’ve had some pregnancy losses, and we’re currently pursuing treatment. During this time, we also became foster parents, with the goal of helping parents and children to reunify (privately, I felt that channeling my grief into helping other parents would be healing).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb3uvr00133b7a2e3t3bbn@published"&gt;Our most recent foster case has transitioned to adoption. We love our soon-to-be son, though we had no idea he’d become legally ours when the case began. Suddenly, I’m very self-conscious about how this looks from the outside. I don’t personally believe that adoption is a solution for infertility, and our little boy is not a consolation prize. I find myself bristling at well-meaning comments from others (“You get to keep him!” being a common one) and I don’t want our toddler growing up thinking he was Plan B. How do I navigate the nuances of two traumatic experiences—our infertility, and our child’s removal from his first family—in social situations without promoting an unhealthy view of family-building?&lt;/p&gt;

Now the challenge is—as it so often is—dealing with others whose understanding is less nuanced, and who have the luxury of an offhand response.&lt;/p&gt;

Neither is it anyone’s business but your own. If there are people in your life—a sibling, a best friend, a parent—to whom you are accustomed to “telling everything,” then go ahead and tell them &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, including your reservations about adoption, your strong feelings about it not being a solution to infertility, and a confession of your anxiety about “how this looks.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="169" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb3v5200183b7a5nq47nyh@published"&gt;But since the cat is out of the bag with (most of?) the people in your life, I’d say you need to divide these well-wishers into two categories: those closest to you and everybody else. With Group 1, retroactively offer an accounting of everything you just told me. With Group 2, the appropriate response to their delighted congratulations (when offered while your son is still young enough not to understand, or when he isn’t present) is to say thanks, and move on to talking about something else. (And do not offer updates as they occur: Consider the discussion of both your efforts to become pregnant and your son’s adoption closed. When you do eventually become pregnant, and you want to share that news with the whole world, no matter what these people say—whether it’s, “OMG finally!” or even “You must be over the moon to be having ‘your own’”—stick to “Thanks.” There’s no percentage in correcting the assumptions of others, especially when the emotional cost to you is high.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="32" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb3v6u00193b7a7v7zn4ex@published"&gt;If there is in fact &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; Group 1—if there is no one in your life to whom you feel you “owe” the whole story—then my advice about Group 2 applies to both.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="191" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb3v8b001a3b7a5e3bjkep@published"&gt;When it comes to your son, all you need to do to make sure he doesn’t feel like Plan B is to love and treasure him—I promise, if you do, he’ll know. And of course doing everything you can to support him through the traumatic loss of his first family (including recognizing that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a trauma—not by pointing this out to him and trying to process it with and for him, but by being available to him as he feels and processes it, and offering him resources to help him do so) will go a long way to ensure that he feels deeply loved and precious to you. In “social situations,” if anyone is thoughtless enough to say to &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;, “Aren’t you a lucky boy?!” or, in his presence, to you, “Aren’t you lucky you got to keep him!” consider laughing, maybe responding with the ambiguous, “Luck has nothing to with it,” and then changing the subject (one of my most reliable go-to’s). Then, when you get home, ask him how the comment made him feel. And let him, for the zillionth time, know how very much you love him.&lt;/p&gt;

He lets them eat handfuls of candy and other things out of those self-serve bins. It’s not only unsanitary, but as far as I’m concerned, it’s stealing and setting a terrible example for them. Jack says he considers it “sampling.” I’m the main breadwinner in the family, and it’s my husband who is usually at home with the kids. It’s he who almost exclusively handles the shopping while I’m at work, which means I can’t be there to supervise what goes on. How can I put a stop to this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb4vvz001q3b7areiyow5k@published"&gt;I’m with you: Letting the kids grab food out of the bins is a terrible idea. Along with what you’ve mentioned, it’s a lousy thing to do to everyone who buys food from that bin after your little germ-carriers have dipped their hands into it. (Your husband is lucky he hasn’t been kicked out of the store yet.) It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; petty theft—you might point out to your husband that “sampling” applies only to what’s offered for free by the store, not what’s taken from them without express permission—and allowing it indeed gives them the message that taking what isn’t theirs to take is OK.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb4vvz001r3b7a0epl8a4s@published"&gt;Try to say this in as non-accusatory a way as you can muster. “I know you don’t want to give them that message,” you might say (lovingly). “They’re too young to understand the subtle difference you understand between taking candy that’s not theirs from a store and taking it from friends, say.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb4vvz001s3b7acts307e3@published"&gt;You might also point out (still keeping your tone level) that if others are doing what the kids are doing, &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are picking up whatever others have been putting down. I know you’ve told him that this practice is “unsanitary,” but I’m guessing that spelling it out in gross detail—“If anyone who has a cold has just blown his nose and then stuck his hand in the bulk gummy worms bin, that cold is definitely going to be passed along to the next poor chump who reaches in for a handful of worms and bits of mucus”—will be more effective. (As my creative writing students know, concrete details will always be more effective than a summary.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="190" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfhb4vw0001t3b7a5wj0iais@published"&gt;I do want to offer one tip for a healthy, long-lasting marriage. Even though you’re right about this business with the bulk bins, in general, it isn’t fair to expect your children’s father to be responsible for their care while you supervise it from a distance. In other words: You’re not the foreman; he’s not the worker. So don’t &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; him he can’t do this anymore; don’t issue orders and don’t make the rules and expect him to follow them. Talk things over with him. In situations where his judgment proves to be less than the best &lt;em&gt;objectively&lt;/em&gt; (theft is wrong; sticking hands in food that others may have stuck their hands in is begging for health trouble; sticking hands in food that others will take home to eat is selfish and mean), have a thoughtful conversation that helps him see things in a way that inspires him to make a better choice. And if he’s doing something with the kids that you don’t care for but that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; objectively bad, maybe keep your opinion to yourself. Nobody likes to have all the responsibility but none of the authority.&lt;/p&gt;

We have two kids, “Sarah,” who is 8, and “Travis,” 11. We left them with my sister, “Olive,” as the wedding was adults-only. During the reception, we got a call from Olive saying that Travis had crashed her car into a neighbor’s parked car while trying to drive off with hers. She said Travis had gotten into her purse and taken her keys while she was in the bathroom. Thankfully, our son wasn’t injured, but he did cause thousands of dollars’ worth of damage to her car and the neighbor’s car he hit.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, she wants my husband and me to pay for it. I say it’s her problem for allowing my son to gain access to her keys in the first place. He could have been killed. (If anything, Olive should be grateful we aren’t suing her!) We don’t owe her anything, right?&lt;/p&gt;

I would further have to assume that she didn’t take those warnings seriously, or she would either have refused your request that she babysit overnight, or locked her purse in a safe and hid all her valuable belongings. Perhaps she could have left her car in a neighbor’s garage, just to be extra safe.&lt;/p&gt;

You should also get him help immediately, whether through a family therapist, individual counselor, or both (stealing her car was not a harmless, run-of-the-mill prank; you’re right that he could have been killed—and so might others have been if he’d made it off your sister and her neighbor’s street). You should recognize that what Travis did is a harbinger of even worse to come if there isn’t an intervention now. You should apologize profusely to your sister.&lt;/p&gt;

Something is very wrong when you reduce an incident such as this to “I’m not giving you a red cent!” and a level of hostility to your sister that rises to your self-righteous assertion that she’s lucky you’re not (yet?) planning to sue her. If your disdain for her long predates this harrowing event, why did you leave her in charge of your children while you went out of town for a wedding? (Unless it wasn’t so much that you were entrusting them to her, but rather that it was a punishment for her past misdeeds.)&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a rule, the stories in our "following up" series look back at previous articles from Goats and Soda. But when freelance journalist Ruchi Kumar pitched the idea of following up on media coverage of a heart transplant for a 12-year-old girl, whose heart had been weakened by illness, we were interested. Doctors drove through one of the most brutal Russian attacks on Kyiv to collect a heart donated by the mother of a 4-year-old who had died of brain injuries from an accident. Here's a look at that extraordinary night — and how the girl with the transplant is now faring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="container large" id="cong-s1-87246-100"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   

   &lt;p&gt;On the night of July 9, Dr. Borys Todurov, the director of the Kyiv Heart Institute, received a call from a colleague at the Ohmatdyt Hospital across the city. Earlier that evenings, a 4-year-old girl had died of brain injuries from an accident, and her parents had agreed to donate her organs.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Todurov had a patient — Kira Skliarova, a 12-year-old girl from Luhansk region of Ukraine — who needed a new heart urgently. Childhood illnesses had severely weakened her own heart. "She was on the waiting list for a long time, and just one day before we implanted her with a mechanical heart, but she needed a transplant," he told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He had to risk his own life to complete the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The donor's body was located about 10 miles from the Heart Institute, which was on that evening under one of the heaviest Russian attacks since the start of the full-scale war in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There were Russian missiles and drones everywhere, the air raid alert was going off," he said. "But we had a chance to save a life so took it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1Dg2zd1hia/" target="_blank"&gt;video made by Todurov&lt;/a&gt; shows their vehicle dodging explosions as Ukrainian air defenses fought off Russian drones. "On our way, we saw a lot of drones, and buildings that they targeted that were on fire," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-88469" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Kira, center, still has a long road to recover but the doctors are optimistic. "Treatment and rehabilitation are ahead," Todurov said, "but Kira now has a chance for a new, full life." Kira is flanked by her mother, right, and the mother of her heart donor, left.

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Girl with a broken heart &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kira's family was displaced during the Russian invasion of their region in 2014 and moved to Kyiv as internally displaced refugees. In 2019, the girl developed a severe case of pneumonia, which eventually led to inflammation of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She was diagnosed with post-myocarditis condition, her mother Alyona Skliarova, told NPR over a phone call. For the next six years, Kira endured a rigorous drug treatment regime and was frequently in and out of hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As her condition worsened, especially in the last six months, "her doctor told us, 'It's time to get her on a waiting list for a new heart,'" Skliarova said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On July 8, her team of doctors decided the girl was facing imminent death and so operated to fit her with an artificial heart — an assistive device to help her body pump blood. "When I came to her [after the surgery], she was lying with that mechanism, with the whole thing on the outside, I could see the blood circulating. [It looked] like a suitcase, like the one we take with us when we go to the railway station," her mother said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I was so shocked, really shocked. That image was not for the faint-hearted people to see," she said. "I wondered, if there isn't a donor heart available, how long could one live with this suitcase device."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the attacks of July 9 began, Kira was in the ICU after her surgery. Her mother was in the hospital but had to go to a shelter because of the intense bombing. Her husband — Kira's dad — had died of COVID in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surgery under fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When news of the donor heart came, Todurov did not hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There was a limited window of time to extract the organ and then transplant it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He and his crew — a scrub nurse, a surgeon and an anesthesiologist — drove to the Ohmatdyt Children's Hospital amid the bombing and began the procedure, even as the ground beneath their feet shivered from the explosions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"During the extraction, we could not only hear the noises of drones and missiles but also feel the vibrations of the explosion," he said. "We knew it was very, very dangerous, but once we had the heart, it would only be viable for a few hours outside the body, so we decided to transport it right away,"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Back at their own hospital, Todurov's team wasted no time to prep for the heart transplant — even as they felt the building shake from the explosions outside.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite the increasing intensity of attacks, they forged ahead. "Surgeries need to be conducted with precision; you need attention, focus, and we are doing this with explosions around us. We are working to save lives, and they are killing civilians around us," Todurov said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"A chance at a new life"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was a very serious attack that night, but the whole time, I was praying to all the gods, Kira, Kira, Kira," her mother recalled. "Somehow we survived the night, and when the air raid alarms ended, I went to see Kira." Her daughter no longer needed to be connected to the artificial heart contraption. "I felt a relief," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Our doctors — they are gods on earth. I am so grateful to them!"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kira still has a long road to recover but the doctors are optimistic. "Treatment and rehabilitation are ahead," Todurov said, "but Kira now has a chance for a new, full life."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first three days after the transplant were sensitive, her mother said, as her body adjusted to the new heart. "She lost some weight at first. Her organs didn't receive enough blood. and she was vomiting when she ate."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After three days, Kira's body embraced her new heart and her health began to improve.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She has some issues with spasticity, where her muscle are stiffened, on the right side of her arm, leg and eye. But she is working with a rehabilitation therapist," her mother said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bittersweet moment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kira's transplant has been a bittersweet moment for the mother of the donor — a 4-year old girl whose organs helped save two other lives that fateful night.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The mother of the donor visited Kira, said Aloyna Skliarova, "and listened to her daughter's heart beat in Kira's chest. On the one hand, that's a tragedy for [her]. On the other hand, it became a chance for life." She added with gratitude: "I respect her so much, and I'm so grateful for her decision. She gave my child a chance to live."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Mother and daughter are determined to make the best of this new lease at life. "I hope we will have more walks in parks, catch up on everything. There are a lot of things in Kyiv that we haven't yet seen, because we've spent these six years in hospitals or laying at home with the sickness," Skliarova said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One dream is to visit the Carpathian Mountains. "I was there once and I want Kira to see this beauty, go for a walk, climb on [the mount] Khomyak," she said. "We are planning to live. Just to enjoy life, with this new heart. Only God knows what the future will be like, but yes, there is a will to live."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruchi Kumar is a journalist who reports on conflict, politics, development and culture in India and Afghanistan.

Both can be diagnosed via blood tests ordered by your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But getting diagnosed may take some self-advocating. “We do not have a routine recommendation in the U.S. to screen for iron deficiency,” Shatzel said. As a result, the problem often goes unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know about iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia, including the signs you should bring up with your doctor:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatigue and brain fog are frequently reported symptoms of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women are often saddled with &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mom-mental-load_l_63f7a67ee4b0616708e04d9a" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="the mental load" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="63f7a67ee4b0616708e04d9a" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;the mental load&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to caring for children, partners, parents and completing must-do tasks around the home. This is often associated with more fatigue and lower mood. And while that is certainly true, iron deficiency can play a role here as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common symptom of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia is fatigue, “but difficulty concentrating, or poor concentration, that sort of mental fog ... is well noted,” Shatzel explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs of iron deficiency also include impaired memory and mood-related complications, Fein added. &lt;a href="https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/psychiatry/news/archive/202305/could-low-iron-be-making-your-mental-health-symptoms-worse" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research shows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/psychiatry/news/archive/202305/could-low-iron-be-making-your-mental-health-symptoms-worse" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that low iron can worsen &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/depression" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="depression" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/depression" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and anxiety, too. People may also have trouble catching their breath after exercise or going up stairs, according to Fein.

Hair thinning is another indicator, according to Shatzel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Bevan Goldswain via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Bevan Goldswain via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Tiredness, brain fog and low mood are all signs of iron deficiency. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common in people who menstruate because of the blood loss.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every time you have a menstrual cycle ... you lose blood. Blood is really your main store of iron,” said Shatzel, noting that it only takes a small amount of blood loss to spark the problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body absorbs iron very slowly, and this is intentional “because if you do get excessive iron, that can be a health risk as well,” Shatzel explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Probably about half of the women who have low iron have heavy periods that they don’t even realize a lot of the time,” Fein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also other causes of iron deficiency, including inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn’s disease, Fein noted. The problem can also be a sign of colon cancer, a gastric ulcer or even Celiac disease, according to Shatzel. These issues can happen in both men and women, but in men, the underlying cause of iron deficiency is &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/prevention-wellness/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-iron-deficiency" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="often more severe" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/prevention-wellness/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-iron-deficiency" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;often more severe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also been a rise in people getting gastric bypass weight loss surgery, “which causes iron deficiency on purpose by causing malabsorption of all nutrients,” Fein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s largely an issue among women with periods and bleeding disorders, Fein added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia is common in pregnancy and can cause complications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia is also common (and under-diagnosed) in pregnant people, according to both experts, which can be particularly dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9541841/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Research shows" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9541841/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that iron deficiency can cause complications in pregnancy for both the mother and the baby, Shatzel noted. These include complications like preterm birth, low birth weight and &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/anemia/pregnancy" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="developmental delays" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/anemia/pregnancy" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;developmental delays&lt;/a&gt;. If moms are fatigued already from low iron, they’re less able to push, resulting in more C-sections, Fein said. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/7246-cesarean-birth-c-section" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="C-sections are more risky" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68c31252e4b072943c55e08c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/7246-cesarean-birth-c-section" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;C-sections are more risky&lt;/a&gt; than vaginal delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And this is a public health problem that affects Black people disproportionately, because it turns out that half of [pregnant] Black people have iron deficiency, and a third of non-Black [pregnant] people have iron deficiency,” Fein added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Iron deficiency is common in pregnancy and can lead to problems for both the mother and the baby if untreated.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treating low iron can improve quality of life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting iron levels to a healthy range not only brings your body back to where it should be, but can make life more enjoyable, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating iron deficiency is done in one of two ways, either by oral iron pills or IV therapy, Shatzel explained. The best remedy depends on the person. Your doctor can help you get the right treatment, but experts say IV iron often tends to be more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If left untreated, in rare cases, blood transfusions are necessary, Shatzel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to treat the underlying cause of iron deficiency, which for many women is heavy periods, and can benefit from birth control and other medical interventions, according to Shatzel. But since low iron can also be caused by GI issues, GI workups are sometimes necessary to figure out the best treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the biggest thing in the general population is the quality of life.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Mediterranean diet may boost cognition &amp;amp; reduce your risk of developing dementia and depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The diet is full of plant polyphenols and omega-3 fatty acids that help reduce inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose healthy cooking methods, such as grilling or roasting, and eat fruit for dessert. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The foods you eat play an essential role in staying sharp as you age, and nutrient-packed, flavor-rich and easy-to-follow eating patterns like the Mediterranean diet make the job easier. A smattering of studies reveals just how this eating plan can be a boon to your brain health and mood today—and in the future. Oh, and there are happiness benefits, too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what exactly happens to your brain when you follow the Mediterranean diet?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Promising research shows that the Mediterranean diet may boost brain health in a few key ways: by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/everyday-habits-hurting-your-memory-11804198" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improving factors like memory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-mistakes-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-11779797" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;decreasing the risk of cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; and bettering mood. Here's a deeper look.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Incorporating the principles of the Mediterranean diet can shore up your smarts. Multiple long-term studies have found that those who more closely followed the Mediterranean diet had &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-avoid-cognitive-decline-study-11782889" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Furthermore, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/olive-oil-cholesterol-study-11786125" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;consuming olive oil&lt;/a&gt;, a staple of the Mediterranean diet, has been shown to improve cognitive functioning.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eating more fish and less meat is also associated with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;positive brain outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to fish's &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026789/best-nutrient-for-brain-health-as-you-age/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-buy-every-week-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke-11749988" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;protect blood vessels in the brain&lt;/a&gt;, quell damage from oxidative stress and reduce inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And there's more. Another study found that following the Mediterranean diet is a promising intervention for improving cognitive impairment in individuals with type 2 diabetes. By improving insulin sensitivity, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-stable-blood-sugar-11758681" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stabilizing glucose levels&lt;/a&gt;, improving cerebrovascular functioning and improving lipid metabolism, the Mediterranean diet may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-if-youre-diagnosed-with-prediabetes-11717158" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduce the risk of complications from diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Help You Prevent Dementia &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though various factors are at play that govern cognitive decline, a healthy diet may help tip the scales in your favor. Both the Mediterranean diet and the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290813/mind-diet-best-foods-to-eat-to-keep-your-brain-young/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt; (a diet similar to the Mediterranean diet, but more focused on foods and nutrients specifically known to support brain health) have been shown in randomized controlled trials to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;slow the rate of cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, one study found that people who had the greatest adherence to a Mediterranean diet had a 72% decreased risk of developing dementia compared to those with the lowest adherence.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In that same study, the higher the score one had on a scale that measured adherence to the Mediterranean diet, the younger, or healthier, their brains seemed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another study found that those who followed the Mediterranean diet had a 11-30% &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cognitive-health-mediterranean-diet-study-11731307" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduced risk of developing cognitive disorders&lt;/a&gt;, including dementia and Alzheimer's disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Though exactly why is still being studied, the Mediterranean diet &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/red-meat-dementia-study-8778192" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;limits red meat and highly processed foods&lt;/a&gt; rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;refined carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;, added sugars and saturated fat. These types of foods may be more likely to increase the risk of heart disease, insulin resistance and inflammation, which may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-are-aging-your-brain-11717608" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;speed brain aging&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sticking to an eating pattern with similar components as the Mediterranean diet may help keep your mood up. One study found that adherence to the Mediterranean diet reduced the symptoms of depression in young and middle-aged adults with major depression or depressive symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Inflammation may be one of the factors driving depression, and the Mediterranean diet promotes foods packed with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-fats-you-should-be-eating-11762137" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory nutrients&lt;/a&gt; from plant-based oils and nuts, fruits and vegetables. Some &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047144/best-anti-inflammatory-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vegetables with the highest anti-inflammatory properties&lt;/a&gt; include broccoli, tomatoes, edamame, peppers, collard greens and mushrooms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; More specifically, another study showed that subjects who adhered to the Mediterranean diet the most had 40% and 39% lower odds for depression and anxiety, respectively, compared to those who were the least able to follow the diet pattern.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Specifically, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fruits-to-eat-every-week-11757821" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating more fruits and veggies&lt;/a&gt; was found to buoy one's mood the most. The Mediterranean diet is rich in fiber, heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, magnesium and B vitamins, all of which have been shown in prior research to benefit psychological health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cognitive health, dementia and depression are all multifactorial, meaning that many variables —from genes to lifestyle habits, such as diet, exercise or smoking, as well as chronic conditions—are risk factors for these diseases that affect your brain. Though incorporating the principles of the Mediterranean diet in a way that fits your culture and preferences is essential, diet alone isn't the answer. What's more, other aspects of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/longform/8059162/dietitian-syrian-roots-mediterranean-diet/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, such as strong social ties, rest and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-to-slow-aging-11793621" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;regular movement&lt;/a&gt;, are also important for brain health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What foods should you eat for your noggin? There are so many possibilities in a Mediterranean diet—fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans and legumes, nuts and seeds, lean protein and healthy fats. And the healthy eating principles of the diet can be applied to any type of cuisine—you don't need to only eat foods and dishes from Mediterranean countries like Italy, Spain and Greece to gain the health benefits. Here are a few brain-supporting foods to try to fit into your routine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fish: &lt;/strong&gt;Fish is a staple protein on the Mediterranean diet. Opt for healthy preparation methods, such as grilling, broiling and baking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plant-based oils:&lt;/strong&gt; Oils such as olive oil, avocado oil and chia seed oil are packed with heart-healthy fats. Olive oil contains anti-inflammatory components that not only directly impact your brain but may also play a role in the health of your gut microbiome, which can also help protect your brain&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Chia seed oil contains plant-based omega-3 fatty acids to reduce overall inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green leafy vegetables:&lt;/strong&gt; Whether in a salad, stirred into soups or pasta dishes or as a sandwich filler, greens such as spinach, kale, lettuces and arugula are essential on the Mediterranean diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fruits&lt;/strong&gt;: Fruits are eaten as part of sweet and savory dishes in the Mediterranean diet. Whether fresh, pureed, dried or frozen, they are enjoyed in abundance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pasta&lt;/strong&gt;: In all shapes and sizes, pasta is enjoyed in the Mediterranean diet. It is often used as a vessel to consume more vegetables, olive oil, herbs and spices.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet is more than food. The lifestyle of the Mediterranean and the cognitive benefits that come from it are rooted in the food, social interaction, everyday movement and quality rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet is primarily filled with plant foods. Vegetables, fruits, legumes, beans, nuts, seeds and whole grains are abundant in the Mediterranean diet. Seafood is an important protein, but other lean meats, such as chicken, pork and beef are also consumed in smaller amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

You’ll see it in gyms, yoga studios, and even in your local grocery store’s “healthy beverages” aisle. Marketed as a natural sports drink packed with electrolytes, it’s often called a “miracle hydrator.” But here’s the real deal: while coconut water does have some legit health perks, it’s not perfect—and drinking too much can actually cause problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s break down the benefits and risks of coconut water in plain English so you can decide whether it deserves a spot in your routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Water Hack?

Natural hydration with electrolytes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever wondered, is coconut water good for hydration? — the answer is yes. Coconut water naturally contains electrolytes like potassium, sodium, and magnesium. That’s why it’s popular among athletes, runners, and anyone sweating it out in hot weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you think coconut water is a healthy beverage option?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10534364/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;shows coconut water works just as well as sports drinks for keeping you hydrated. Some studies even suggest it might feel easier on the stomach during long workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Supports heart health &amp;amp; blood pressure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, coconut water is packed with potassium, which helps balance sodium levels in your body. For people with slightly high blood pressure, this can be helpful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some small studies link coconut water to better circulation, lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, and a boost in HDL (“good”) cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the catch: if your potassium levels are already normal, you probably won’t see a huge heart-health benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. May help with blood sugar &amp;amp; antioxidants&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024170417" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;studies &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;show coconut water may improve blood sugar control and reduce diabetes-related damage. It also contains antioxidants that help fight free radicals, which can cause cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, human research is still limited. If you have diabetes, coconut water isn’t a magic cure, but choosing unsweetened coconut water over soda or juice is a healthier option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Kidney stone prevention&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9262403/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;suggests coconut water can help reduce the risk of kidney stones by increasing the excretion of potassium, citrate, and chloride. Basically, it may help your body flush out minerals that can build up into stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have kidney disease, a moderate amount of coconut water may be a kidney-friendly choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Digestive &amp;amp; immune support&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water has small amounts of enzymes that may support digestion. Plus, it contains vitamin C and lauric acid, which may help with immunity. The effects are subtle, but every little bit helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The risks of coconut water&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now for the not-so-fun part. Coconut water isn’t risk-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Too much potassium can be dangerous&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it’s so high in potassium, drinking too much coconut water can cause hyperkalemia (excess potassium in the blood). This can lead to irregular heartbeats and, in severe cases, cardiac arrest. People with kidney disease or those taking potassium-sparing meds should be especially careful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Digestive issues &amp;amp; allergies&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water acts like a mild laxative for some people, which can lead to diarrhea or too much urination if overdone. It can also trigger allergic reactions in those sensitive to coconuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sugar &amp;amp; calories add up&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s natural, coconut water has sugar—around 6–8 grams per cup. For someone with diabetes or watching calories, this can sneak up on you. Always go for unsweetened coconut water instead of flavored or added-sugar versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contamination risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re traveling and drinking straight from a questionable coconut, there’s a small chance of bacterial or fungal contamination. Rare cases of food poisoning have been reported. Safer bet: stick to pasteurized coconut water from trusted brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should drink coconut water?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut water is great for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy adults looking for a refreshing, low-calorie drink&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Athletes or anyone sweating a lot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People needing a mild potassium boost&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it may not be ideal for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with kidney problems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those on potassium-altering medications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone with diabetes (unless consumed in moderation)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much coconut water is safe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most healthy adults, 1 cup (about 8 oz) a few times a week is perfectly fine. Just don’t chug liters of it daily and expect miracle results. Think of it as a supplement to your hydration, not a replacement for good old-fashioned water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is coconut water good for you? Yes, when enjoyed in moderation. It’s refreshing, naturally hydrating, and comes with some real health benefits like supporting hydration, heart health, and possibly kidney stone prevention. But it’s not a super-drink, and too much can actually be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy coconut water as part of a balanced diet, but don’t rely on it to fix health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 03:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-AFBVV95cUxPekh6SjJ3dmQtSmdtR1VGVWVFbFhWUlJfZ3hxVkU4N1dRSUY3VnhHVXRldWxGbGc3RE1BZExpd2RFMlBpUTdmWGF0MWJMVDg5MER6NGQ1VS1UXzM3OWtObzZIUUZuUGozU1dQMVJNT1M1Z25aLWZpTTVldVh3ZlZjLXpiQTFEWU5sdkNER2JhYTREbkw5cG1mWmhqbTFvSEZtYWZyN0RDVU5DWmNvN3Jwak1JYm5aalp1bU9KTlF5eTRZUUNueVFhREIwVWx0RUllMWJIOW03RjRrRmpPbWJBUHoxWC1lMHZvb0dQczlxbmowTy1PWmZtU9IB_gFBVV95cUxQaHFneFJkYkVNMXM0aWxKb1UxOGZMYzVWNkNsTm15ZHotMUJPUlpTSVdqOFdQaXZGUGN6WWUyNGdvZjlNYzR5cThXMVV4cmdhdjdxQUcyQ1R6QlhrY3JwMzkteGdTN3hKYmRaWFA2MWhtT1VndGo2V1dpam93UmJGd2otZEZ6d0d5S0ZyX2gyQTk2eFFRR3JWZUwtZmdJdnNyVnpaVFB3X0xDVDlPd1RXUVBTb2pWSF9OcDJ3ajNpUkJtUmxGcHE0cUxRbEpmYnRFeEhiS0wwc01qRUVGdjBOX3BMX0dJVTQ0UDJmZlBfTktYSzJ5SnZRX3VidDJ5QQ</guid></item><item><title>维生素D可能有助于减缓衰老，研究结果- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/vitamin-d-may-help-slow-aging-study-finds/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content cf entry-content content-spacious"&gt;

A new study suggests vitamin D may protect the delicate chromosome caps linked to aging, potentially lowering the risk of age-related diseases. Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A clinical trial suggests vitamin D may slow cellular aging by preserving telomeres. Researchers urge caution on dosing and emphasize lifestyle as the most reliable path to healthy aging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D supplements may help safeguard the protective caps on our chromosomes that influence the pace of aging, raising hopes that the “sunshine vitamin” could support healthier longevity, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40409468/"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers reported that taking 2,000 IU (international units, a standard vitamin measurement) of vitamin D each day helped preserve telomeres, the small structures at the ends of chromosomes that act like the plastic tips of shoelaces, shielding &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;DNA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule made of two long strands of nucleotides twisted into a double helix. It serves as the hereditary material in humans and nearly all other organisms, encoding the genetic instructions used for development, functioning, and reproduction. Most DNA resides in the cell nucleus (nuclear DNA), while a smaller portion is found in mitochondria (mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; from damage during cell division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of our 46 chromosomes ends with a telomere, which gradually shortens every time a cell divides. Once &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0099-1"&gt;telomeres&lt;/a&gt; become critically short, cells lose the ability to divide and ultimately die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortened telomeres have been associated with several major age-related conditions, including &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/26/9/1381/71345/The-Association-of-Telomere-Length-in-Peripheral"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g4227.abstract"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40520-021-01944-6"&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;. Factors such as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28704792/"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt;, chronic &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8920518/#:%7E:text=Stress%20induces%20secretion%20of%20glucocorticoids,to%20short%20and%20dysfunctional%20telomeres."&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-07076-5"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; appear to accelerate this process, while &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-025-10237-8"&gt;inflammatory processes&lt;/a&gt; in the body also contribute to telomere loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Beyond strong bones&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is widely recognized for its role in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4781354/"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in helping the body absorb calcium. Adequate intake is especially important for children, adolescents, and individuals with darker skin or limited sun exposure to ensure proper &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ph56/chapter/What-is-this-guideline-about"&gt;bone growth and maintenance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But vitamin D also powers our immune system. A review of evidence found that vitamin D supplements can cut respiratory infections, especially in people who are deficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early research even suggests it might help prevent autoimmune diseases like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27644953/"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27510600/"&gt;lupus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568997212001310"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, though more trials are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-025-10237-8"&gt;inflammation damages telomeres&lt;/a&gt;, vitamin D’s anti-inflammatory effects could explain its protective role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Testing vitamin D in a clinical study&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this recent study, from Augusta University in the US, the researchers followed 1,031 people with an average age of 65 for five years, measuring their telomeres at the start, after two years, and after four years. Half took 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily, while the other half received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that telomeres were preserved by 140 base pairs in the vitamin D group, compared with a placebo. To put this in context, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19666704/"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; found that telomeres naturally shorten by about 460 base pairs over a decade, suggesting vitamin D’s protective effect could be genuinely meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first promising finding. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21986705/"&gt;Earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; have reported similar benefits, while the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6316700/#:%7E:text=3.1.-,Consumption%20of%20Specific%20Foods,28,33,34%5D."&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; – rich in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25131600/"&gt;anti-inflammatory nutrients&lt;/a&gt; – has also been linked to longer telomeres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The catch&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are some important points to note. Some researchers warn that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6715353/"&gt;extremely long telomeres&lt;/a&gt; might actually increase &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2300503"&gt;disease risk&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting there’s a sweet spot we don’t yet understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also no agreement on the right dose. The Augusta researchers used 2,000 IU daily – much higher than the current recommended intake of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7019735/"&gt;600 IU&lt;/a&gt; for under-70s and 800 IU for older adults. Yet other research suggests just &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5949172/"&gt;400 IU&lt;/a&gt; might help prevent colds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-021-00593-z"&gt;optimal dose&lt;/a&gt; probably depends on individual factors, including existing vitamin D levels, overall nutrition, and how the vitamin interacts with other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these findings are exciting, it’s too early to start popping high-dose vitamin D in the hope of slowing aging. The strongest evidence for healthy aging still points to the basics: a balanced diet, regular exercise, quality sleep, not smoking, and managing stress, all of which naturally support telomere health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you’re deficient in vitamin D or at risk of poor bone health, supplements remain a sensible choice backed by decades of research. As scientists continue unravelling the mysteries of aging, vitamin D’s role in keeping our cellular clocks ticking may prove to be just one piece of a much larger puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="428" data-end="710"&gt;Stress has a way of sneaking into everything. It shows up in tense shoulders, restless sleep, and the constant feeling that you’re running on empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="428" data-end="710"&gt;The busier life gets, the more your nervous system carries the weight—and most of us don’t realize how badly we need ways to reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="712" data-end="1009"&gt;Hobbies might sound like an afterthought when you’re stressed, but psychology says they’re actually one of the best tools for calming the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="712" data-end="1009"&gt;They give your mind a break from the endless loop of work, notifications, and worries, while signaling to your nervous system that it’s safe to let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1011" data-end="1143"&gt;Here are nine hobbies backed by research that can help you turn down the volume on stress and bring your system back into balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1145" data-end="1162"&gt;1. Gardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1164" data-end="1376"&gt;I still remember planting my first herb pot on the tiny balcony of my first apartment. Watching those fragile green shoots push through the soil felt strangely healing, like I was rooting myself alongside them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1378" data-end="1681"&gt;Psychologists often point to the restorative effects of nature. A study in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2019/04/09/20-minute-nature-pill-relieves-stress"&gt;&lt;em data-start="1453" data-end="1478"&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that gardening reduces cortisol (the stress hormone) and improves mood even after short periods of time outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1378" data-end="1681"&gt;For stressed people, this is more than a pastime—it’s a form of natural therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1683" data-end="1902"&gt;Even if you don’t have a backyard, tending to herbs on a windowsill or a couple of houseplants can bring a sense of calm. The act of watering, pruning, and watching something grow gives you a gentle, grounding anchor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1904" data-end="1922"&gt;2. Journaling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1924" data-end="2160"&gt;Have you ever felt like your mind is running twenty tabs at once? Writing them down can feel like finally closing a few. Journaling gives stressed people a private outlet to process the constant churn without judgment or interruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2162" data-end="2440"&gt;Research published in the &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374669665_Expressive_Writing_Moderates_the_Relation_Between_Intrusive_Thoughts_and_Depressive_Symptoms#:~:text=Expressive%20writing%20moderates%20the%20relation%20between%20intrusive,or%20by%20desensitizing%20people%20to%20such%20thoughts."&gt;&lt;em data-start="2188" data-end="2224"&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that expressive writing helps regulate emotions and reduce intrusive thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2162" data-end="2440"&gt;By turning nebulous worries into concrete words, your nervous system relaxes—you’re literally organizing your feelings on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2442" data-end="2656"&gt;Start simple: jot down three thoughts before bed, or keep a running log of moments that made you feel grateful, overwhelmed, or inspired. Over time, those pages become a roadmap for understanding yourself better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2658" data-end="2670"&gt;3. Yoga&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2672" data-end="2897"&gt;Step onto a mat, and you’re stepping into one of the most proven practices for nervous system regulation. Yoga combines mindful breathing with slow, deliberate movement, giving stressed bodies a safe way to release tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2899" data-end="3154"&gt;A meta-analysis in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245214"&gt;&lt;em data-start="2918" data-end="2928"&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that yoga reduces anxiety and stress by modulating the parasympathetic nervous system—the system responsible for rest and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2899" data-end="3154"&gt;For someone whose nervous system is constantly running hot, that’s game-changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3156" data-end="3392"&gt;You don’t need a fancy studio or expensive gear. A quiet corner, a mat, and a short online video can be enough. Even five minutes of stretching with intentional breaths can shift your body out of fight-or-flight and back into balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3394" data-end="3424"&gt;4. Knitting or crocheting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3426" data-end="3672"&gt;When my grandmother taught me to crochet, I thought I’d never get the hang of it. Then one evening I realized hours had passed and my brain had been blissfully quiet the entire time. Without me noticing it, the repetitive motions had lulled me into a meditative state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3674" data-end="4033"&gt;That’s the beauty of fiber arts—they occupy your hands just enough to calm the mind without overstimulating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3674" data-end="4033"&gt;Psychologists describe this as “&lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-flow-2794768"&gt;flow&lt;/a&gt;,” a term coined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, which refers to the mental state of being fully immersed and losing track of time. Flow states have been shown to reduce stress and increase feelings of well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4035" data-end="4186"&gt;Knitting, crocheting, or even weaving are hobbies that let stressed people settle into rhythm and quiet focus, soothing frayed nerves in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4188" data-end="4213"&gt;5. Walking in nature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4215" data-end="4388"&gt;There’s a reason a long walk in the park can feel like medicine. For stressed people, being outside in natural spaces is like hitting a reset button on the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4390" data-end="4747"&gt;Psychological research backs this up: a study in &lt;a href="https://environhealthprevmed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s12199-009-0086-9#:~:text=The%20results%20show%20that%20forest,a%20strategy%20for%20preventive%20medicine."&gt;&lt;em data-start="4439" data-end="4485"&gt;Environmental Health and Preventive Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that spending time in forests (often called “forest bathing”) lowers heart rate and reduces stress hormones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4390" data-end="4747"&gt;If you're constantly weighed down by daily tension, a wooded trail or even a tree-lined neighborhood walk can bring down the static in your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4749" data-end="4903"&gt;You don’t need a destination. Just moving your body and letting your senses tune in to birdsong, leaves rustling, or the smell of soil can restore calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4905" data-end="4934"&gt;6. Painting or sketching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4936" data-end="5137"&gt;A blank page and a handful of colors can do more for stress than most people realize. Creative expression allows you to externalize what you’re feeling, transforming pressure into something tangible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5139" data-end="5400"&gt;Art therapy is well-studied in psychology. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5836011/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that even simple drawing or painting can reduce cortisol and create a state of relaxation. You don’t have to be an artist—the act matters more than the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5139" data-end="5400"&gt;I once tried urban sketching during a particularly stressful season, carrying a small notebook and pen on my lunch breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5139" data-end="5400"&gt;Sitting on a park bench, sketching buildings and strangers passing by, I realized how quickly my focus shifted from my own worries to the lines and shapes in front of me. By the time I put my pen away, my thoughts felt calmer and more ordered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5402" data-end="5549"&gt;Let yourself doodle, paint abstract swirls, or sketch without rules. It’s about giving your emotions a place to land where words aren’t required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5551" data-end="5587"&gt;7. Playing a musical instrument&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5589" data-end="5785"&gt;Have you ever noticed how playing music can pull you out of your head? Strumming a guitar, tapping piano keys, or even trying a hand drum shifts your focus from overthinking to rhythm and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5787" data-end="6100"&gt;Psychologists note that music-making engages multiple parts of the brain, stimulating relaxation and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5787" data-end="6100"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11742191/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, musical activities lower stress and promote emotional resilience. For people under constant stress, it’s not just fun—it’s therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6102" data-end="6292"&gt;Pick an instrument that feels approachable, even if it’s something simple like a kalimba or ukulele. The act of playing—however imperfect—creates a soothing dialogue between you and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6294" data-end="6334"&gt;8. Cooking simple, nourishing meals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6336" data-end="6589"&gt;There’s a comfort in chopping vegetables, stirring a simmering pot, and tasting as flavors come together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6336" data-end="6589"&gt;In fact, this is one of my go-to hobbies whenever life feels overwhelming. Cooking can be both grounding and sensory-friendly, offering a safe space to engage touch, smell, and taste in calming ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6591" data-end="6788"&gt;Cooking also creates predictability—something we crave when life feels out of control. The sequence of steps and the satisfaction of a finished dish can bring the nervous system a sense of order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6790" data-end="6936"&gt;It doesn’t need to be elaborate. Even preparing a pot of soup or baking bread can feel like a ritual that centers your body and eases your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6938" data-end="6971"&gt;9. Meditation and breathwork&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6973" data-end="7172"&gt;Living with stress means your awareness is constantly heightened, and that can be exhausting. Meditation and breathwork give that awareness a direction, turning it from overwhelming to restorative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7174" data-end="7462"&gt;A large body of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3004979/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; supports this. Mindfulness meditation increases gray matter in brain regions linked to emotional regulation. In other words, it helps train your nervous system to respond more calmly to life’s stressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7464" data-end="7694"&gt;Even a few minutes of slow, deliberate breathing—inhale for four, hold for four, exhale for four—can shift your system out of fight-or-flight. Over time, this practice becomes a tool you can rely on whenever life feels too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7696" data-end="7715"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7717" data-end="7896"&gt;Stress might be part of life, but it doesn’t have to run the show. These hobbies are more than just ways to pass time—they’re tools your nervous system can lean on to find rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7898" data-end="8206"&gt;You don’t need to tackle all nine. Start with one or two that feel doable and notice how your body responds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7898" data-end="8206"&gt;Whether it’s gardening, journaling, or cooking something simple, the point is the same: giving yourself regular, reliable ways to calm down is one of the most powerful antidotes to constant stress.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

I’d never heard of thyroid cancer. It was such a shock.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similar cases are becoming increasingly common. Thyroid cancer – which affects the small, butterfly-shaped gland in the neck – has soared over the past two decades. In the UK, diagnoses have risen by 62 per cent in just ten years and are expected to climb by nearly three-quarters by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thyroid makes and releases hormones that control many important functions, including metabolism – how the body uses energy – as well as heart rate, temperature and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is one of five cancers rising in younger adults, according to the American Cancer Society, alongside throat, prostate, kidney and colon. And cases of thyroid cancer are nearly four times higher in women than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colombian-American actress Sofia Vergara, British actress Marisa Abela, and Love Island star Demi Jones have all spoken publicly in recent years about their diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Actress Sofia Vergara underwent treatment for thyroid cancer when she was 28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each of them developed the disease before the age of 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say the surge in thyroid cancer cases may partly be explained by improvements in medical technology, with more tumours detected that might otherwise have gone unnoticed and never caused problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-739e2530-90c0-11f0-b6f9-d9b47bd516c7" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15095311/common-medical-test-doctors-fear-thyroid-cancer.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;IT'S A FACT &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 7,000 children developed thyroid cancer in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some doctors point to a more controversial reason: that medical technology itself is actually fuelling the rise. They warn that excessive use of X-rays and CT scans expose patients to unnecessary radiation, which can raise the risk of developing the cancer. Children are most at risk, as exposure at a young age is more likely to cause problems decades later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It sounds alarming, yet in June a major study reached a similarly stark conclusion. Researchers found that about 5 per cent of all new cancers in the US could be linked to CT scans – a toll comparable to those caused by alcohol. About 4,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with thyroid cancer each year, most of them aged between 70 and 74. But cases have almost tripled over the past three decades, with young women the fastest-growing group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The wider rise in cancers among younger adults has drawn considerable attention in recent months, with experts pointing to ultra-processed foods, obesity and even certain strains of gut bacteria as possible drivers. However, when it comes to thyroid cancer, specialists say the explanation is less straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There’s no doubt of an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer over the past 25 years,’ said Professor Fausto Palazzo, an endocrine surgeon at Hammersmith Hospital in west London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In large part, we believe it’s related to the fact that we’re simply detecting more disease.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, he added, that doesn’t mean more cancers aren’t developing than before. ‘It just makes it more difficult to interpret.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors warn that excessive use of X-rays and CT scans expose patients to unnecessary radiation, which can raise the risk of developing the cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The key question, he said, is whether there is something that is making thyroid cancer more common in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The only two things we know that increase the chance of thyroid cancer are genetic history and radiation exposure,’ he continued. ‘And while there has been some theorising that an increase in radiation exposure in the environment in recent decades could be contributing to cases, it’s very difficult to prove.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some experts are attempting to do just this. Dr Riccardo Vigneri, emeritus professor of endocrinology at the University of Catania in Italy, has spent decades studying thyroid cancer. In a 2020 paper he analysed 18 years of data from the Californian death registry. If the surge were due only to overdetection, the records would show a rise mainly in small, slow-growing tumours – the kind that may not cause harm. Instead, they showed a marked increase in larger, more advanced cancers, along with a rise in deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That, he argued, was clear evidence the trend could not be explained by scanning alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘All evidence indicates the causes of worldwide increase in thyroid cancers are recent, environmental and multiple,’ he wrote in the journal Cancers. The ‘most likely contributing factor’, his team concluded, was increased exposure to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Historically, the most severe exposures followed nuclear events – from the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki to Chernobyl – where children nearby developed thyroid tumours at high rates. But today, the greatest source of man-made radiation comes from medicine –diagnostic tests such as X-rays and CT scans, which use high-energy beams to produce detailed images of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-93c95050-90c0-11f0-b6f9-d9b47bd516c7" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15095311/common-medical-test-doctors-fear-thyroid-cancer.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;IT'S A FACT &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thyroid gland is responsible for producing the hormones that control the body’s temperature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A landmark analysis by researchers from several US universities showed that, between 1980 and 2006, the average radiation dose received by Americans had doubled – with CT scans responsible for more than half of that exposure. Around a third of all CTs were directed at the head and neck. Children face the greatest risk, as their developing tissues are especially sensitive to radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study of more than 11 million Australians found that children who underwent CT scans had a 40 per cent higher risk of thyroid cancer later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2010, endocrinologists at Mercy Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago warned that the surge in medical radiation was running in parallel with rising thyroid cancer rates, and urged doctors to limit the use of CT scans in young patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But experts stress that the scans are often lifesaving – they’re vital for detecting tumours, internal bleeding or serious infections – and that the overall risk to any individual patient remains very small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies suggest thyroid cancer may also be linked to radon gas – a natural by-product of uranium in the ground that seeps into homes. Already known to cause lung cancer, a 2020 study from the University of Guam found signs it could raise thyroid cancer risk too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But many experts say it is too soon to draw firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In medicine, we’re stuck with epidemiology – the study of disease in a population – to guide us in deciding whether or not a certain factor is responsible,’ said Prof Palazzo. ‘And without this type of large-scale research, we can’t say anything with certainty.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research is looking beyond radiation, including the role of iodine – a trace mineral essential for producing thyroid hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iodine is found in fish, dairy products and eggs, yet a 2010 study of more than 700 UK schoolgirls showed over two-thirds were deficient. Historically, about half of Britain’s iodine intake came from milk – but levels have fallen with the decline of free school milk and the rise of vegan and dairy-free diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regions where iodine deficiency is common also tend to report higher rates of thyroid cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because the thyroid needs iodine to make hormones, explained Dr Jahangir Ahmed, consultant ENT surgeon at OneWelbeck in London. ‘If you’re not getting enough iodine, the thyroid gland can become bigger, thinking it will help it make more,’ he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When this happens, the growth driver might also cause mutations in the thyroid cells, which is the precursor to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The same thing happens in pregnancy – the baby demands more iodine, which can make the mother deficient.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has pointed to hormone-disrupting chemicals and air pollution as possible drivers. A 2022 study by the University of Beijing found thyroid cancer rates were higher in areas with poor air quality. Scientists at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Shenzhen, China, also reported links between the disease and endocrine-disrupting compounds found in everyday products such as flame-retardants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a 2020 study, researchers from Tulane University in the US and Egypt’s Suez Canal University concluded there was ‘strong evidence’ that certain man-made chemicals can impair thyroid function, raising the risk of future tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for why women seem to be more affected than men, the answer is similarly speculative. ‘It’s most likely hormone related,’ said Dr Ahmed, ‘as we know after menopause that the rates of men and women getting thyroid cancer start to come together.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women may also be at higher risk because of their increased likelihood of autoimmune conditions, where the body begins to attack the thyroid gland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ahmed added: ‘This causes chronic inflammation, and can make the thyroid more prone to cell mutation.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s important to remember that thyroid cancer generally has an excellent prognosis. While some forms are more aggressive, the two most common types – papillary and follicular – are usually slow-growing and highly treatable. ‘If you catch it in a reasonable time, more than 90 per cent of patients can be cured,’ said Dr Ahmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs and symptoms of thyroid cancer include a lump in the throat or neck, a hoarse voice lasting more than three weeks, breathing problems or difficulty swallowing. Anyone with these symptoms should see a doctor without delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment often involves surgery to remove part or all of the thyroid, sometimes followed by radioactive iodine therapy to destroy any remaining thyroid cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For very small tumours, less than a centimetre across, doctors may recommend monitoring rather than operating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I reassure the majority of my patients that they’ve got time,’ said Dr Ahmed. ‘With a few exceptions, thyroid cancers have an excellent prognosis.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;I was diagnosed aged 31... and there were no warning signs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was during a rare attempt to relax that special needs teacher Jess Cain, right, now 35, first discovered the lump in her neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was having a massage and the masseuse immediately told me something didn’t feel right,’ said Jess, pictured right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I felt it too and agreed. It was like a marble under the skin, beneath my ear, that became more prominent when I turned my head.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerned, Jess booked an appointment with her GP, who reassured the then 31-year-old it was most likely a swollen lymph node from an oncoming cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A week later she still felt fine but the lump hadn’t gone. After insisting on being seen again, Jess was referred for a scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Months later, an ultrasound revealed a suspicious mass in her neck. And just five days before Christmas, she was told it was cancerous. A biopsy and surgery in January confirmed it was thyroid cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was so confused,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I had had no symptoms and, when I was diagnosed, I didn’t know anyone with thyroid cancer at all.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then Jess has had her thyroid removed, undergone radioactive iodine therapy, and endured further surgery to shave down part of her neck. Now she wants others to understand how destabilising the disease can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘People refer to it as “the good cancer” because it’s easily treated, but it’s already been two years with it for me and I’ve already had a resurgence within three months of getting the all-clear,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There’s no such thing as a good cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 00:41:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQOGw2NUw4Wnk3UWlYWWhPV3FtcTdUZ2JFc05DRXlXSkJHb2Vsd3BlVlFyVjZWbmNmVWNUTF91TDFkY19zSTB5QUVZZTRhcVFIYVhQRUVRZTl6dHNJbmgwVVRRRUdmaGF3djBEaGJjSnNfcS1ETlVhR2tfVkhackNNZzJwQWRuckNacExsOEZqODhVVmkxY1ZMcmZUQk1RTElGZFBQZjQyUQ</guid></item><item><title>常见的测试医生担心甲状腺癌激增的背后-每日邮报</title><link>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15095311/common-medical-test-doctors-fear-thyroid-cancer.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just 31 and in good health, Jess Cain was horrified to discover a small lump in her neck, which she had thought little of, was &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-006a86e0-90bf-11f0-b6f9-d9b47bd516c7"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The special needs teacher felt well, with no symptoms, and went to the doctor only after a massage therapist spotted the growth and urged her to get it checked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Expecting reassurance, she was instead diagnosed with thyroid cancer and told she would need surgery almost immediately, followed by months of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My surgeon told me I’d likely had the tumour for almost a decade,’ recalled Jess. ‘But I hadn’t had any pain or any other symptoms.

A biopsy and surgery in January confirmed it was thyroid cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was so confused,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I had had no symptoms and, when I was diagnosed, I didn’t know anyone with thyroid cancer at all.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then Jess has had her thyroid removed, undergone radioactive iodine therapy, and endured further surgery to shave down part of her neck. Now she wants others to understand how destabilising the disease can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘People refer to it as “the good cancer” because it’s easily treated, but it’s already been two years with it for me and I’ve already had a resurgence within three months of getting the all-clear,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There’s no such thing as a good cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 00:41:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNM21IVVBUUmVadFZNeWFWOXBYaEdreFA1NHhVT2FHaWxMSW91V21vZUFFR19zNGdrUV9RSGJfSFk1SmhRUEVvaHRHbkdQenBJT0tWOGZUNDBLNURuTWxTbGFDODFDZWlydEE2SDVPVGJnc1h2SVo5MHRRQnFSSTFUZGVUQzkxd0dKbXRXUktkc25heHljU1d1Y3VaNk92dkdNWER4RFdB</guid></item><item><title>挖掘声称RFK Jr.和白宫“埋葬”研究将酒精使用与癌症联系起来- Snopes.com</title><link>https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/09/13/rfk-jr-alcohol-cancer-study-buried/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-content"&gt;

&lt;ul class="snopes_key_points"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2022, both the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/prevention/iccpud/alcohol-intake-health-study"&gt;Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; and Congress commissioned reports on the health effects of alcohol, to be provided to the committee that produces the United States government's dietary guidelines every five years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2025, days before President Donald Trump took office, a &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-draft-public-comment-alcohol-intake-health-study.pdf"&gt;draft of the two studies&lt;/a&gt; was published in the &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/15/2025-00416/request-for-public-comments-on-reports-on-alcoholic-beverages-and-health-to-inform-the-dietary"&gt;Federal Register&lt;/a&gt; for public comment. The health department's study found that alcohol was very risky to health, while the study commissioned by Congress found that a small amount of alcohol might be slightly beneficial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/alcohol/info#what-does-the-dietary-guidelines-say-about-alcoholic-beverages-"&gt;Current dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommend that people who do not drink alcohol should not "&lt;span&gt;start drinking for any reason." The guidelines recommend men limit themselves to two drinks a day, and women limit themselves to one drink a day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-drop-guidance-limit-alcohol-one-or-two-drinks-per-day-sources-say-2025-06-18/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In June 2025, Reuters published a story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that said four anonymous sources claimed the committee responsible for producing the 2025-30 dietary guidelines planned to drop the recommended limits on alcohol consumption.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/460086/rfk-jr-trump-maha-cancer-alcohol-study-health"&gt;In September 2025, Vox published a story&lt;/a&gt; alleging that Trump's administration and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had "buried" the health department's study. This is somewhat true — researchers were informed their final report would not be published in any form — and somewhat false — the draft version of the report was available to read online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sept. 4, 2025, Vox &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/460086/rfk-jr-trump-maha-cancer-alcohol-study-health"&gt;published a story&lt;/a&gt; that claimed U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the White House had "buried" a major study on alcohol and cancer. The story detailed the convoluted path of the &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/prevention/iccpud/alcohol-intake-health-study"&gt;Alcohol Intake and Health Study&lt;/a&gt;, initially commissioned in 2022 by the nation's health department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vox's story claimed the study (technically a meta-analysis, or a &lt;comment-start name="ea59068b10dacd768b952be487e7fb6dd:202ec"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;review&lt;comment-end name="ea59068b10dacd768b952be487e7fb6dd:202ec"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt; of existing research), which found an "increased mortality for seven types of cancer" at all levels of alcohol usage, had been hidden from public knowledge by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kennedy, his health secretary. (Alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/alcohol/alcohol-fact-sheet"&gt;has been classified as a carcinogen&lt;/a&gt; since as early as 1987, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2834641?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamaoncol.2025.1146"&gt;but that isn't well-known&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/g5SkH"&gt;spread&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/uXcx4"&gt;on social&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/7pb96"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;, and Snopes readers emailed and searched the site looking for more information about whether the administration had prevented the study's publication. &lt;comment-start name="e48f8c8843f6b2dbdd2fbdd1dcb8984af:f98ae"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;We contacted the health agency, the White House and scientists involved in the study for comment. &lt;comment-end name="e48f8c8843f6b2dbdd2fbdd1dcb8984af:f98ae"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;We had not heard back from the White House at time of publication; &lt;comment-start name="e03ca3ed2501608d598d0e3037931eb66:e1a3a"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;the health department provided basic information on the study but did not respond to specific questions.&lt;comment-end name="e03ca3ed2501608d598d0e3037931eb66:e1a3a"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One version of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study &lt;i&gt;was,&lt;/i&gt; in fact, publicly available. In the days before Trump returned to office in late January 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-draft-public-comment-alcohol-intake-health-study.pdf"&gt;a draft version was published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/15/2025-00416/request-for-public-comments-on-reports-on-alcoholic-beverages-and-health-to-inform-the-dietary"&gt;Federal Register&lt;/a&gt; to allow for public comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite the study's authors sending the government their final version in March 2025, according to Vox's reporting, the final report had not been published, as of this writing. Three of the authors told Vox they learned the administration was&lt;span&gt; not going to publish the study in any form, but did not say who gave them that information. (In an email to Snopes, one author, Tim Naimi, declined to elaborate but said he was "confident" that information was correct).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are further complications to the story, too. The study was supposed to be included in a presentation to Congress on underage drinking, but the &lt;comment-start name="eb2fadb8bf69497da4c546477291b5a39:e6a95"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;researchers told Vox their report would not be &lt;comment-end name="eb2fadb8bf69497da4c546477291b5a39:e6a95"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;included. The study also was supposed to inform the United States' dietary guidelines for the next five years, but &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-drop-guidance-limit-alcohol-one-or-two-drinks-per-day-sources-say-2025-06-18/"&gt;Reuters reported in June&lt;/a&gt; that the government was planning to drop the recommended daily limit for alcohol from its guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the complicated situation, we have elected to forgo a rating. Here's what we know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dietary guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every five years, the Health and Human Services and Agriculture departments collaborate to release the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;, a list of recommended eating and drinking habits aimed to keep citizens healthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to prepare the guidelines, the government asks a committee of scientists and doctors to produce a comprehensive advisory report on the state of the average American health and diet and any recommended changes to the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, before 2020, the dietary guidelines recommended that men limit alcohol consumption to two drinks per day, and women to one drink per day. In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/ScientificReport_of_the_2020DietaryGuidelinesAdvisoryCommittee_first-print.pdf"&gt;the committee's report recommended&lt;/a&gt; lowering the daily limit for alcohol consumption to one drink per day across the board. The report is only advisory, and the 2020 dietary guidelines &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/alcohol/info#what-does-the-dietary-guidelines-say-about-alcoholic-beverages-"&gt;kept the previous limit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://archive.ph/MSstG"&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The two alcohol studies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the health department commissioned a report investigating the risks of alcohol consumption, called the &lt;comment-start name="ef7b298c583a84cf04e5f859295f61728:a6038"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/prevention/iccpud/alcohol-intake-health-study"&gt;Alcohol Intake and Health Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;comment-end name="ef7b298c583a84cf04e5f859295f61728:a6038"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;, conducted by a group of outside scientists. (This is the one the Vox headline claimed has been "buried").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that year, Congress commissioned the National Academies to write a report investigating the risks of alcohol consumption, called the &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Review of Evidence on Alcohol and Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/460086/rfk-jr-trump-maha-cancer-alcohol-study-health"&gt;The Vox story&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Congress commissioned the alcohol health study &lt;comment-start name="e5a86aed2cf17e0274a771750f06e830f:ae2ea"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;because of lobbying from the alcohol industry, which alleged the independent scientists were anti-alcohol. &lt;comment-end name="e5a86aed2cf17e0274a771750f06e830f:ae2ea"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;One co-author on the health department's study told Vox that lawmakers claimed she had a conflict of interest because she "&lt;span&gt;accurately described scientific research in the media." Another author, Naimi, told Snopes he was "very proud" of his record, and that criticism from politicians and industry "comes with &lt;comment-start name="e53f28fb8272f5a98713025358f90c321:46bf3"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;the subject matter" of alcohol. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;comment-end name="e53f28fb8272f5a98713025358f90c321:46bf3"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both studies were commissioned with the idea that they would be provided to the committee in charge of producing 2025-30 dietary guidelines. Vox also reported that the health department's study was supposed to factor into an annual report to Congress on underage drinking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the studies were published in January 2025, in the days before Trump took office, the differences in their findings were clear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-draft-public-comment-alcohol-intake-health-study.pdf"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health department's study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found consuming alcohol was very risky for health, while &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health"&gt;&lt;span&gt;the National Academies' study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found consuming a small amount of alcohol might even be beneficial. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the health department told Snopes via email that "&lt;span&gt;a final version was subsequently provided … &lt;comment-start name="e03b6905823d821e77b053302ff64fc9a:b26ff"&gt;&lt;/comment-start&gt;to HHS/OASH&lt;comment-end name="e03b6905823d821e77b053302ff64fc9a:b26ff"&gt;&lt;/comment-end&gt; [the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health] and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for consideration as the development of the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines, which remains ongoing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snopes also asked the health department who was involved in the reported decision to not publish the final version of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study, and whether the dietary guidelines committee was considering dropping its guidance on a daily limit for alcohol consumption, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-drop-guidance-limit-alcohol-one-or-two-drinks-per-day-sources-say-2025-06-18/"&gt;as reported by Reuters&lt;/a&gt;. We did not receive a response to those questions. &lt;/p&gt;

(Alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/alcohol/alcohol-fact-sheet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:has been classified as a carcinogen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;has been classified as a carcinogen&lt;/a&gt; since as early as 1987, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2834641?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamaoncol.2025.1146" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:but that isn't well-known;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;but that isn't well-known&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The article &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/g5SkH" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:spread;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;spread&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/uXcx4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:on social;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;on social&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/7pb96" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:media;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;media&lt;/a&gt;, and Snopes readers emailed and searched the site looking for more information about whether the administration had prevented the study's publication. We contacted the health agency, the White House and scientists involved in the study for comment. We had not heard back from the White House at time of publication; the health department provided basic information on the study but did not respond to specific questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One version of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study &lt;i&gt;was,&lt;/i&gt; in fact, publicly available. In the days before Trump returned to office in late January 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-draft-public-comment-alcohol-intake-health-study.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a draft version was published;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a draft version was published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/15/2025-00416/request-for-public-comments-on-reports-on-alcoholic-beverages-and-health-to-inform-the-dietary" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Federal Register;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Federal Register&lt;/a&gt; to allow for public comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, despite the study's authors sending the government their final version in March 2025, according to Vox's reporting, the final report had not been published, as of this writing. Three of the authors told Vox they learned the administration was&lt;span&gt; not going to publish the study in any form, but did not say who gave them that information. (In an email to Snopes, one author, Tim Naimi, declined to elaborate but said he was "confident" that information was correct).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are further complications to the story, too. The study was supposed to be included in a presentation to Congress on underage drinking, but the researchers told Vox their report would not be included. The study also was supposed to inform the United States' dietary guidelines for the next five years, but &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-drop-guidance-limit-alcohol-one-or-two-drinks-per-day-sources-say-2025-06-18/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reuters reported in June;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Reuters reported in June&lt;/a&gt; that the government was planning to drop the recommended daily limit for alcohol from its guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Given the complicated situation, we have elected to forgo a rating. Here's what we know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Dietary guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Every five years, the Health and Human Services and Agriculture departments collaborate to release the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dietary Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;, a list of recommended eating and drinking habits aimed to keep citizens healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In order to prepare the guidelines, the government asks a committee of scientists and doctors to produce a comprehensive advisory report on the state of the average American health and diet and any recommended changes to the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For instance, before 2020, the dietary guidelines recommended that men limit alcohol consumption to two drinks per day, and women to one drink per day. In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/ScientificReport_of_the_2020DietaryGuidelinesAdvisoryCommittee_first-print.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the committee's report recommended;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the committee's report recommended&lt;/a&gt; lowering the daily limit for alcohol consumption to one drink per day across the board. The report is only advisory, and the 2020 dietary guidelines &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/alcohol/info#what-does-the-dietary-guidelines-say-about-alcoholic-beverages-" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kept the previous limit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;kept the previous limit&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://archive.ph/MSstG" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:archived;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;archived&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The two alcohol studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2022, the health department commissioned a report investigating the risks of alcohol consumption, called the &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/prevention/iccpud/alcohol-intake-health-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alcohol Intake and Health Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Alcohol Intake and Health Study&lt;/a&gt;, conducted by a group of outside scientists. (This is the one the Vox headline claimed has been "buried").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Later that year, Congress commissioned the National Academies to write a report investigating the risks of alcohol consumption, called the &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Review of Evidence on Alcohol and Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;Review of Evidence on Alcohol and Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/460086/rfk-jr-trump-maha-cancer-alcohol-study-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Vox story;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Vox story&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Congress commissioned the alcohol health study because of lobbying from the alcohol industry, which alleged the independent scientists were anti-alcohol. One co-author on the health department's study told Vox that lawmakers claimed she had a conflict of interest because she "&lt;span&gt;accurately described scientific research in the media." Another author, Naimi, told Snopes he was "very proud" of his record, and that criticism from politicians and industry "comes with the subject matter" of alcohol. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both studies were commissioned with the idea that they would be provided to the committee in charge of producing 2025-30 dietary guidelines. Vox also reported that the health department's study was supposed to factor into an annual report to Congress on underage drinking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the studies were published in January 2025, in the days before Trump took office, the differences in their findings were clear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-draft-public-comment-alcohol-intake-health-study.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The health department's study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health department's study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found consuming alcohol was very risky for health, while &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the National Academies' study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;the National Academies' study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found consuming a small amount of alcohol might even be beneficial. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A spokesperson for the health department told Snopes via email that "&lt;span&gt;a final version was subsequently provided … to HHS/OASH [the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health] and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for consideration as the development of the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines, which remains ongoing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Snopes also asked the health department who was involved in the reported decision to not publish the final version of the Alcohol Intake and Health Study, and whether the dietary guidelines committee was considering dropping its guidance on a daily limit for alcohol consumption, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-drop-guidance-limit-alcohol-one-or-two-drinks-per-day-sources-say-2025-06-18/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:as reported by Reuters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;as reported by Reuters&lt;/a&gt;.

							&lt;p&gt;Have you been told you should get a check-up and clean every six months? Perhaps your dental clinic’s or health insurance policy’s default is to ask you to book these services twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at whether this advice is based on evidence or opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you need regular check-ups and cleans?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A regular oral health checkup usually involves a dentist or oral health practitioner (dental therapist, dental hygienist, oral health therapist) examining the teeth, gums and surrounding structures of the mouth. This helps identify signs of tooth decay or gum disease, in addition to any changes to soft tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most instances, you will have your teeth professionally cleaned in the same visit, with a “scale and clean”, along with dental x-rays to identify issues that aren’t visible to the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular brushing with fluoride toothpaste and cleaning between teeth (for example, by flossing) at home can’t reach all the surfaces of the teeth and gums. Professional cleaning is needed to remove the remaining plaque and tartar (calcified dental plaque) and the bacteria they contain, which cause tooth decay and gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does the research evidence say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all research is equal: some types of evidence are more reliable than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cochrane systematic reviews are the most trusted because they use rigorous methods to collect and evaluate all available research evidence on a specific health question. These reviews judge how strong the evidence is and whether the studies might be affected by bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adult oral health check-ups, a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004346.pub5"&gt;2020 Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt; found strong evidence that six-monthly check-ups did not offer any additional benefit in preventing tooth decay or gum bleeding, compared to those whose frequency of check-ups was risk-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk-based means dental practitioners set the time between dental check-ups depending on the individual’s risk of dental disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review, which looked at data over four years, also found there wasn’t enough good research to know how different dental check-up schedules affected children’s and teenagers’ teeth and gums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the issue of six-monthly professional cleaning, a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004625.pub5"&gt;2018 Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt; found strong evidence that having regular professional cleaning made little or no difference to signs of gum disease (gingivitis or bleeding gums), or to levels plaque deposits, compared to adults with less regular professional cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a small reduction in tartar levels, however it’s unclear if this is meaningful to consumers and dental practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants who had six- or 12-monthly cleans reported their teeth felt cleaner than those who didn’t have scheduled cleans, but there was no difference between groups in reports of quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these reviews, six-monthly visits and cleans don’t seem to consistently lead to better oral health for adults compared to check-ups and cleans based on individual risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So can you forgo six-monthly visits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular professional dental check-ups are important throughout life, starting from the eruption of the first tooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But everyone has different oral health needs and risk levels which should be reflected in the frequency of their check-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people who are at high risk of oral disease do need to see a dental practitioner more regularly: every six months or even more often – such as every three months – to treat severe gum disease or tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with good oral health might only need to visit a dental practitioner every year or two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others still may be willing to pay for six-monthly check-ups and cleans for peace of mind, despite their lower oral health risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How else can I keep my teeth and gums healthy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintain your oral health by brushing twice a day with fluoridated toothpaste. The evidence shows children and adults who brush less than twice daily are at high risk of tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleaning between your teeth can also help reduce gum problems and dental plaque – more than brushing alone. You can use traditional dental floss or a flossing tool. Interdental brushes, which have a tiny bristled head that fits between teeth, can also be more effective than flossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who lack manual dexterity and for children, water flossers can be an effective alternative to traditional flossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, avoiding sugars added to foods and drinks, as well as the sugars naturally found in honey, syrups and fruit juices, helps protect teeth from tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HIDALGO COUNTY, Texas (&lt;a href="http://valleycentral.com" data-type="link" data-id="valleycentral.com"&gt;ValleyCentral&lt;/a&gt;) — The Hidalgo County Health and Human Services has issued a warning following the recent outbreak of the Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a statement issued by the Hidalgo County Health and Human Services, over 60 cases of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease have been reported in four schools in Hidalgo County.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hidalgo County Health Authority Dr. Ivan Melendez informs the public that the disease primarily affects children but can spread to adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Melendez explains that the symptoms include fever, chills, a scratchy throat, nausea, and blisters that typically appear on the hands, feet, and mouth by the third day after being infected with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="btah1kyr" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“The most infectious moment is during the first three days, when most people don’t know they even have it, because it’s spread through mucus, droplets, coughing, not washing hands and any bodily fluids,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health experts added that there is no cure for this virus, but doctors will provide symptomatic care by providing medications such as Tylenol and Motrin. Additionally, they will recommend patients to eat easy-to-chew foods such as macaroni and mashed potatoes, as the blisters can cause pain while eating. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Melendez advised that children can go back to school once they have gone a full day without a fever and their blisters are drying out. &lt;/p&gt;

By 85, it strikes one in three. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most patients are still of retirement age or older, but doctors warn the disease is striking Americans younger than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, the number of dementia cases in people under 65 more than doubled between 1990 and 2021. And the risk of developing dementia any time after age 55 is upwards of 40 percent, the latest research shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lesser known forms of the disease like frontotemporal dementia, which tend to affect adults as young as 40, have also become more common in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to Daily Mail at the world's largest dementia conference in July, neurologists warned they are seeing patients younger and younger stepping into their offices, claiming they can no longer keep track of their meeting calendar or remember where they put their keys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said part of this &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14663791/symptoms-early-warning-sign-young-onset-dementia.html"&gt;surge in early-onset dementia&lt;/a&gt; could be due to young people getting tested earlier than their parents and grandparents, especially if they have a family history.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they also sounded the alarm about chronic diseases and other lifestyle factors increasingly plaguing young people such as diabetes, obesity, depression and stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In one of the most tragic early-onset dementia cases, Robin Williams was found to have been suffering from Lewy body dementia after dying by suicide in 2014 at age 63. He is pictured here with actress Zelda Williams in 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Adrian Owen, a professor of cognitive neuroscience and imaging at the University of Western Ontario in Canada and chief scientific officer at dementia detection company Creyos, told Daily Mail: 'We're seeing people younger, and we're seeing people with different types of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the last 15 or 20 years, we've sort of gone from the focus being squarely on Alzheimer's disease, that's all people used to talk about, to now broad recognition of frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, many different types of dementia, and they present in sometimes subtly different ways.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe a range of progressive neurological disorders that impact memory, thinking and behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms include memory loss, poor judgment, confusion, repeating questions, difficulty communicating, taking longer to complete normal daily tasks, acting impulsively, and mobility issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's disease, which affects about 7million Americans, is the most common form, and it typically affects those over 65, with the risk increasing with age. But around 200,000 have early-onset Alzheimer's, the latest research shows.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Joel Salinas, adjunct professor of neurology at NYU Langone in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-e69c1000-8cfc-11f0-827f-b725c85fde96"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and Chief Medical Officer of telehealth platform Isaac Health, told Daily Mail that while most people with dementia are diagnosed after age 65, the disease often strikes much earlier before patients realize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told this website: 'We know that these conditions start to develop 10 or even 20 years before you even obviously notice symptoms, and these symptoms are present in a continuum where the earliest symptoms may be really subtle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We want to get better at detecting things where they're in that subtle range.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both doctors told Daily Mail that younger patients who come into their clinics are less likely to come in with stereotypical signs like wandering or forgetting who their loved ones are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mol-fe-xpmodule-comment-cta="true" data-article-id="15022377" data-channel="health" data-environment="production" data-platform="mol.web.desktop" data-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15022377/Dementia-experts-reveal-heartbreaking-trait-new-patients-common.html" data-version="1.1.4" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Wendy Williams was diagnosed in 2023 frontotemporal dementia and aphasia at age 59&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Salinas said: 'Anxiety can give an early presentation. Social isolation can be an early presentation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think we're still figuring out whether those symptoms are either tied to having cognitive deficits that are suddenly getting worse, like having difficulty remembering so I'm getting anxious about it, or they're manifestations of the disease in the brain itself.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Younger patients may also notice trouble staying organized at work or around the house, which shows a decline in working memory. Obsessive behaviors are also common&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Salinas also pointed to the example of a writer having trouble coming up with a typical word they would use in a piece and that difficulty worsening over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'If I have a harder time reaching those words, and that's getting worse over time, that actually would be a red flag, kind of like forgetting keys, or walking to a room and not remembering why I walked into the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But the key is actually to see are these changes that are persistent and getting worse slowly over time over like six months to a year or two years. Then I would consider that as something that really is a red flag that should be addressed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While much is unknown about why dementia is increasingly affecting younger Americans, lifestyle factors likely play a significant role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13688417/factors-raise-risk-dementia-REVEALED-half-cases-avoided-people-changes-life-experts-say.html"&gt;Lancet Commission study&lt;/a&gt; found about 40 percent of Alzheimer's cases could be tied to 14 modifiable risk factors, including high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity and depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a study unveiled at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC) in July of 2,000 Americans at risk of dementia found that strict diet and exercise regimens helped them &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14947279/doctors-reveal-simple-lifestyle-changes-prevent-dementia-study.html"&gt;perform significantly better at cognitive tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of these risk factors are on the rise across America, including in young people. CDC data shows the prevalence of obesity, for example, has doubled in adults from 1990 to 2021, and 40 percent of adults are now considered obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above chart shows changes in cognitive scores over time among people who implemented structured changes and those who implemented self-guided ones in the US POINTER study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diabetes prevalence has also increased from about 10 percent in 2000 to 14 percent in 2023, and prevalence among people under 44 has increased about 20 percent in 2024 compared to 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These conditions trigger inflammation throughout the body, including in the brain, that damages cells and promotes the accumulation of toxic proteins that kill brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Owen said: 'I think in the past, dementia was always a really mysterious illness that seemed to just hit some people randomly and not other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now you're seeing more people with cognitive changes and potentially dementia at a younger age. It's almost a byproduct of the fact that younger people are developing diabetes, younger people are getting obese, younger people have anxiety and depression. There are increased levels of mental health challenges that tend to affect young people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mental health is another key factor, he emphasized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CDC data shows the percentage of adults with anxiety symptoms has increased from 16 percent in 2019 to 18 percent in 2022. Meanwhile, depression is up from 10.5 percent in 2015 to about 18 percent in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Owen said: 'There are many other factors in today's world that young people are that are contributing to this sort of cognitive mental health crisis is probably better than epidemic, but I think one of them is anxiety and stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'No question, young people are more stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People are worried about their futures. They're worried about their employment. They're worried about their health earlier on. We know stress has detrimental effect on brain functions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Salinas also noted that while lifestyle factors and mental health are at play, he has seen more patients get evaluated for dementia as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I would say we are seeing more and more people who are coming to get evaluated at a younger age, partly because I think [there are] cultural changes around the importance of addressing these issues early.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Owen urged younger Americans who notice issues like trouble focusing, personality changes, issues remembering words and other subtle signs to seek medical care, as early intervention opens the doors for more effective treatments and getting into clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told this website: 'Early detection is so crucially important. The earlier you get in, the more effective it's going to be.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 18:39:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>作为脱发专家，有一种食物我永远不会吃... -每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15094913/hair-loss-expert-food-never-eat-causes-balding.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When a study last month linked drinking lots of fizzy drinks to hair loss, it underlined the crucial role of diet in a condition affecting millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now experts have revealed other everyday foods that could have a similar effect – including pasta, sliced bread and nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthy hair needs a steady supply of nutrients, and although illness and genetics play a part in hair loss, what people eat and drink can make these factors better – or worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ellie Rashid, consultant dermatologist at the private OneWelbeck clinic, said: ‘Diet is so important. Deficiency of the right nutrients will lead to brittle hair, less hair growing or hair being shed more readily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Iron deficiency, for example, impacts hair growth, while a vitamin D deficiency is linked to hair thinning.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common cause of hair loss is pattern baldness, influenced by genetics and hormones. Another trigger is the autoimmune condition alopecia areata, in which the immune system attacks hair follicles. Dr Rashid believes diet plays a role in both. ‘Many things can cause hair loss, but diet is like a switch that can ramp up the effects of these other factors or dial them down,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recommends blood tests for iron, zinc, vitamin D and folate (vitamin B9), and adopting a balanced diet. Iron can be boosted with red meat, lentils and leafy greens such as spinach and kale. Vitamin D can be topped up with sunlight and supplements and zinc can be increased through supplements and foods such as pumpkin or sesame seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While good foods support healthy hair, evidence suggests others may trigger or accelerate balding. Here, The Mail on Sunday highlights some of the foods that could harm your hair... and those that will give it a boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ellie Rashid is a consultant dermatologist at the private OneWelbeck clinic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Ditch white bread, cakes and sweets &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Refined carbohydrates include foods high in processed sugar, such as cakes, sweets and fizzy drinks, along with white bread and pasta made from grains stripped of natural fibre. Because they are digested quickly, they cause spikes in blood sugar and insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2016 study in the journal Menopause Review concluded: ‘Consumption of highly processed foods, rich in simple sugars, is one factor causing excess hair loss.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found insulin spikes led to ‘disturbances’ in blood vessels, reducing oxygen supply to the scalp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rashid advises switching from white bread and pasta to wholemeal. She said: ‘Refined carbs are a driver of inflammation. They negatively impact&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;cellular processes such as keratin formation – meaning hair doesn’t grow as well as it should.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Don't overdo Brazil nuts  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brazil nuts are rich in selenium, a mineral that supports the thyroid, the immune system and reproductive health – but too much can damage hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Paul Farrant, consultant dermatologist at Experts In Skin And Hair, said: ‘The recommended dose of selenium can come from as little as one brazil nut a day. It’s easy to take too many. Selenium toxicity is linked to brittle hair and disturbs the hair cycle.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Warning over a sandwich favourite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;T, particularly larger species such as yellowfin and bluefin, can contain mercury from feeding on contaminated prey. Mercury can damage the nervous system, the kidneys and even hair follicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Farrant said: ‘It’s not something most of us eat in sufficient quantities to get toxicity, but you can get heavy metal poisoning from tuna. Hair needs good nutrition, and if you add things that are effectively poisons it will affect hair growth and cause hair loss.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;The best food for your hair? Eggs! &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;EGGS are among the best foods to nourish healthy locks. Packed with protein and key vitamins, they help keep hair strong and glossy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Farrant said: ‘If you eat lots of eggs, your hair will benefit. Hair is a protein-rich structure, based on keratin, which means you need plenty of protein in your diet to grow strong hair. Eggs are a great source of protein.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are also high in vitamin B12 and folate, and are a source of vitamin D, which plays a vital role in the hair growth cycle. ‘If you’re deficient in vitamin D,’ he said, ‘more hairs exit the growing phase and move to the shedding phase.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it doesn’t matter how you cook your eggs, your hair will still reap the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-04d50460-90a8-11f0-8dbe-d3916b45d4e7" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15094913/hair-loss-expert-food-never-eat-causes-balding.html"&gt; &lt;font&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;IT'S A FACT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;September is considered the worst month for hair shedding, which maybe related to temperature changes &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 16:38:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNTnFENzkwcVZEWlBTVUNCRG56MTZfTGpOU0RGOWRtbEY3ZEFFVkZWUFNOaVpJemFycmVTT2N4aGFLX1haWHhXVG9ISmJTNlowcG5kLVJNME45UERvZXlfbmhDdEJqVlZta2I3VXpmMlM5TFhEdGJxM2QyXzJOeFJ0YWFGZDRKT0hxbmVwbExUU1FaeXpOTkxubW11WU16R293aTJUSEp3</guid></item><item><title>专家敦促美国人了解败血症的迹象- upi.com</title><link>https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2025/09/13/sepsis-signs-awareness/5011757769531/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="stph_caption"&gt;Despite 1.7 million sepsis cases and more than 350,000 deaths each year, experts say Americans don't know what sepsis is or how deadly it can be.

    &lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On World Sepsis Day, health experts remind Americans that sepsis strikes 1.7 million people in the U.S. each year and causes more than 350,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet despite those staggering numbers, many Americans don't know what sepsis is or how to recognize it before it turns deadly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Symptoms can range from rapid breathing, increased rate, fever, chills and sudden drop in blood pressure," Dr. Faisal Masud, medical director of critical care at Houston Methodist, said in a news release. "It's important to share your symptoms with a health care professional as soon as possible as early recognition can make a difference between life and death."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is an extreme response to infection. When the immune system overreacts, it triggers widespread inflammation that can damage organs and lead to death. Even a minor infection can set off this dangerous reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, sepsis is responsible for 1 in 10 ICU admissions and remains the leading cause of death in U.S. hospitals, experts say. And most cases begin outside of the hospital, making it essential to spot early warning signs at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors recommend remembering the acronym T.I.M.E.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;T stands for temperature change (such as fever)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I is for infection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;M stands for mental status change&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;E is for extremely ill feeling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Symptoms can range from rapid breathing, increased rate, fever, chills and sudden drop in blood pressure," Masud added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can develop sepsis, but certain groups face higher risk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children under age 1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elderly individuals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with chronic illnesses such as &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/diabetes/diabetes-overview" target="_blank"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, kidney disease, liver disease or cancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those with weakened immune systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sepsis is a medical emergency. Treatment often includes antibiotics and IV fluids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sharing your symptoms with a medical professional in the emergency room is crucial and even asking the question, 'do I have sepsis?' can make a lifesaving difference," Masud said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7965961/anti-inflammatory-mediterranean-diet-dinner-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory Mediterranean meal recipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 249 to 373 calories while the lunches span 333 to 488 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_163-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean style of eating is marked by a diet that is high in fruits, vegetables, beans, lean proteins, nuts, seeds, with low to moderate intakes of dairy. It is typically low in saturated fat and added sugars and higher in fiber, antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids. Years of research has concluded that following a Mediterranean-style eating pattern reduces the risk of obesity, heart disease, cancer, cognitive decline, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_164-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_165-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Having a healthy gut microbiome also has many of these same benefits. Data has shown that in addition to helping with constipation and digestion, good gut bacteria may help improve mood, sleep and heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Probiotics—fermented dairy, kimchi, sauerkraut—are foods that contain healthy gut bacteria, while prebiotics—onions, garlic, banana, lentils—are foods that feed good gut bacteria. Furthermore, both a healthy microbiome and the Mediterranean diet are associated with helping maintain a healthy weight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

A new line of research points to a simple lever that might lower risk – the color of light reaching our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.jthjournal.org/article/S1538-7836(24)00543-9/abstract"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; explores how specific wavelengths shape biology through the body’s daily timing system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists call this the circadian clock, a network that tunes hormones, blood pressure, and blood vessel tone across the 24 hour day, as shown in a comprehensive &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5983320/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author &lt;a href="https://providers.upmc.com/provider/elizabeth-ann-andraska/3013812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elizabeth Andraska, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (&lt;a href="https://www.medschool.pitt.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UPMC&lt;/a&gt;), and her colleagues asked a basic question. Does the spectrum of visible light change the way blood forms clots in living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-light-color-on-blood-clots"&gt;Testing light color on blood clots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a peer reviewed study, the team exposed mice to red, blue, or white light for 12 hours a day over 3 days, then used standard models to trigger clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red light before the challenge led to nearly five times fewer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/red-blood-cells-found-to-squeeze-clots-tight-using-physical-force/"&gt;clots&lt;/a&gt; than blue or white light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same study reported no benefit in genetically blind mice, and shining light directly on blood outside the body did not change clotting. That pattern points to an eye to brain pathway rather than a direct effect on blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-clots-and-red-light"&gt;Blood clots and red light&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blood-platelets-play-a-critically-important-role-in-the-body-that-was-unknown-until-now/"&gt;blood platelets&lt;/a&gt; – the small cell fragments that stick together to stop bleeding and can spark harmful clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red light exposure was linked to lower platelet aggregation and activation, signaling a less reactive clotting profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also tracked neutrophil extracellular traps (&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nri.2017.105" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NETs&lt;/a&gt;), which are sticky webs released by white blood cells to capture microbes but also snag platelets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice given red light formed fewer NETs in clots and brain tissue after an induced stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noticed that platelets in the red light group had more healthy fats, including oleic and linoleic acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fats are known to make platelets less likely to stick together, which matched the reduced clotting activity they observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the scientists examined &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4369169/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;megakaryocytes&lt;/a&gt;, the bone marrow cells that make platelets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single cell data suggested changes in pathways tied to inflammation, stress responses, and cytoskeletal control, all of which relate to how platelets activate and aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hints-from-human-patients"&gt;Hints from human patients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators went a step further and reviewed outcomes in more than 10,000 adults who had cataract surgery with either standard lenses or lenses that filter a slice of blue light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among people with cancer, who face about a ninefold higher clot risk than the general population according to a recent open access &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12001707/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, those with blue light filtering lenses had a lower lifetime risk of venous clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That retrospective signal does not prove cause and effect. It does align with the mouse findings and with prior evidence that clotting biology tracks daily timing cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-means-for-you"&gt;What it means for you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research does not replace proven prevention like movement during long trips, anticoagulants when prescribed, or hospital safety protocols. It does raise a precise, testable idea about light and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ginkgo-biloba-plant-may-be-key-to-preventing-blood-clots-vericose-veins/"&gt;clot&lt;/a&gt; biology that clinical trials can evaluate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light is not acting as a drug in the bloodstream. It seems to work through the optic system and brain timing networks, which then influence immune cells and platelets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animal benefit appeared when red light came before the clotting challenge, not after it. That timing suggests a preventive window and warns against over reading the result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human biology is more complex than lab models. The lens analysis was observational, so unmeasured variables could explain the signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-think-about-light-in-daily-life"&gt;How to think about light in daily life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clotting problems remain common and deadly, especially after hospitalization and in major illnesses. Even small, safe reductions in risk could help many people if confirmed by trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer amplifies &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-harness-soundwaves-vibrations-to-strengthen-tissues-and-heal-wounds-blood-clots/"&gt;clot&lt;/a&gt; risk for biological reasons that include tumor driven inflammation and pro coagulation signals. Any non drug intervention that safely trims that risk would be worth careful testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most modern environments flood us with short wavelength light from screens and overhead fixtures. The new study suggests wavelength balance might matter, along with timing and duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morning light helps set healthy rhythms, while circadian disruption raises cardiovascular strain. That makes lighting a public health question as much as a lab topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expect controlled human studies that standardize wavelength, intensity, timing, and duration. Devices that deliver known doses through the eyes would allow rigorous testing of dose and response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will also map how retinal signals talk to the brain and then to bone marrow and immune cells. Those pathways could reveal new drug targets alongside any light based strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://www.jthjournal.org/article/S1538-7836(24)00543-9/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 15:46:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNT29fRlZ5NHBwUmRxeDExTi1Nd1RTeTlUM2MyZTY2U1JIX2Q2UFB6X2UtVU5RMnJlZlNPdjVPOG1Oa1B0UzRnVEJWZjV0b2ZzWC00YjBPRGFmcXlEUnB0akxXREQwZENCeDRJMGwyQTFNY0dCNXdLeG9SNUxGTXNRLWZXNlRIZXNacGZBYXJLdDJveGVqRzRUUlQ0cw</guid></item></channel></rss>
