Monday, Elizabeth Schafer, the lead author of the study and a surveillance and health equity scientist, called the findings "promising news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The uptick of cases is likely due to first-time screening in the wake of new recommendations for younger average-risk adults to begin testing for colorectal cancer earlier," Schafer explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook, who is a gastroenterologist, called the findings "really good news," noting that early detection means it's very likely to be curable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they're in the very earliest stage, they're more than 90% curable," he said &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/why-more-colon-cancer-cases-are-being-detected-early/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:on "CBS Mornings,";elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;on "CBS Mornings,"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are symptoms of colon cancer to be aware of — including changes in bowel habits, constipation, bleeding and fatigue — LaPook said proper screening can prevent people from getting to the point where symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If at any point you do a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colonoscopy-adr-withdrawal-time-ask-your-doctor/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:colonoscopy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and you find a benign polyp that was destined to become a colon cancer, and you remove it, instead of getting colon cancer, you do not get colon cancer," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another lead author, Jessica Star, who does cancer risk factors and screening surveillance research at the ACS, said it's "thrilling" to see increases in screening rates among younger adults as well as its likely ties into rises in earlier stage diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she warned there's a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Screening for colorectal caner in ages 45-49 remains suboptimal and has not increased equitably by both education attainment and insurance status," Star said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, medical associations expressed concern after a report that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

This could lead to more preventable sun damage, especially among younger people who are influenced by wellness content online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="NVO6BQUYMBA2JMSOT6XE42OP4U" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="NVO6BQUYMBA2JMSOT6XE42OP4U" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why does the U.S. have fewer sunscreen options than Europe and Asia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YTZXMDL745DITDD64KFGI7DD2A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration regulates sunscreen, but U.S. standards have not kept up. The last major sunscreen monograph proposal came in 1999. This document serves as the FDA’s official guideline for what ingredients can be used in over-the-counter sunscreens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WPEYZKJFWRGCLGRALPIBRZRT2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Although the agency proposed updates in recent years, delays have left many newer active ingredients, which are already used in Europe and Asia, unavailable in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="35BFMVHI7ZAXPPOSLM6CLRE7K4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This regulatory delay has drawn criticism from dermatologists and public health experts who say the U.S. is falling behind global standards and giving consumers fewer safe options. Some people, frustrated by the lack of innovation, are turning to imported products or homemade solutions, which Friedman strongly discourages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HKH7L2HFKBA3LMVJPYG6FOM26Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Would you make Tylenol or Advil in your bathtub?” Friedman said. “There’s no way to replicate the safety, testing and effectiveness of a professionally formulated sunscreen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CCIKQHVH35DMPKIWVHF2ACEELA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Other countries often approve sunscreen filters faster by following a different regulatory model that emphasizes post-market surveillance and international data. The European Commission evaluates sunscreen ingredients under a cosmetics framework that allows newer filters to reach the market more quickly. Some advocacy groups are calling on Congress to require faster review timelines or align with international standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GR255TW55BBK5H75OOYMO4HCWA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Dermatologists say the science continues to support daily use of FDA-approved sunscreens to prevent skin cancer. They warn that avoiding sunscreen altogether poses a far greater risk than any concern about ingredient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 11:32:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxPd3NNMWpZdko1d2xnenRFQTc2VVJaa3huODd3VUJIdmdCUUQwa1l1UjBuM2RvWGtlaGZra040aDlwNTdWZmtBTlZneU05OFlzRHhseU90dU9HRm5FSkgwenZpV2NRVkJyV05Ta2F6RXk0MWYyUllUQzAwNll0MHc0Q3h0WUYzQQ</guid></item><item><title>骨盆底物理治疗师说，这是每个人（包括男性）都应该做的三项运动- Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7gFBVV95cUxNaWg2ZWlRSHNpNFh0MjhhcjFheVNVbHdLdlNNWlctNGlxa1BMaFZUSEdic2lCOU05b0ZpTG9IMGMyWDJnT3B6Yi1hMVVmTkZlUUFfSXk5a0tSbUprbkh5cW1ySUhNUWVFUnAwbkRhUmtoRHd4dzhGR1ZMSTJDbmpxdmIwQjJSYnpfZzBLWDZranc3UFpIMXBPSzRiQ1l2cUdfdDNTZ1Z4Qzc0N3Uzek9wUTcydDhiS1FZWkp4RFFWd1AxZW9vNXNEaVVFdkNDUVZuNS1EWDdjSE4tRUM3dW84RDY5c1hqZXl4V2ZIQ2hB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p id="b8346db7-cf2f-4462-9452-775cdd313d1d"&gt;Pelvic floor issues can have a big impact on your quality of life, particularly if you're dealing with incontinence or experiencing pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, over 25 million adult Americans experience temporary or chronic incontinence, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nafc.org/bhealth-blog/what-to-know-about-urinary-incontinence-in-women/" target="_blank" data-url="https://nafc.org/bhealth-blog/what-to-know-about-urinary-incontinence-in-women/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;National Association for Continence&lt;/a&gt;, but there are exercises you can do to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="b8346db7-cf2f-4462-9452-775cdd313d1d-2"&gt;"We should all be strengthening our pelvic floor in the same way that we should all be physically active," says pelvic floor physical therapist at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ten.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ten.co.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Ten Health&lt;/a&gt;, Leanne O'Brien.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want to aim for prevention, as opposed to being reactive when the problem already exists," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that menopausal and postmenopausal women are more prone to incontinence, O'Brien says that strengthening the pelvic floor is particularly important for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, incontinence can still be an issue for men, especially later in life, so there are benefits to strengthening your pelvic floor whatever your sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-do-you-strengthen-the-pelvic-floor" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-do-you-strengthen-the-pelvic-floor"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How do you strengthen the pelvic floor?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="afb5beeb-b8da-4874-8770-192e2a8d9f29"&gt;There are specific ways to strengthen the floor, like the Kegel exercises that O'Brien has shared below, but it's also important to strengthen supporting muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-VrX3XPvG3vBsUCWvjucfRW" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-VrX3XPvG3vBsUCWvjucfRW slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pelvic floor works with other muscles around the pelvis," O'Brien explains. "If you have weakness through the gluteal muscles or abdominal muscles, it means that the pelvic floor has to work harder."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've had patients who have had surgery, who have been told they have to do pelvic floor exercises. They have an incredibly strong pelvic floor, but actually they've not done any strength training," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that even though their pelvic floor is strong, it's having to work extremely hard to support the glutes and abs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you do glute and core exercises correctly, you actually recruit the pelvic floor muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're engaging the abdominal muscles and you're doing an abdominal or a core-based exercise, you'll also be working on the pelvic floor," confirms O'Brien.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recommends strength training twice a week or three times a week if you have symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-three-moves-to-strengthen-the-pelvic-floor" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-three-moves-to-strengthen-the-pelvic-floor"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Three moves to strengthen the pelvic floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="acc695da-f06e-4689-aeb4-e3af2068d9a6"&gt;O'Brien has shared three exercises that target the pelvic floor, glutes and core, all of which will help you strengthen the pelvic floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You should never be symptomatic during the exercise, so you shouldn't have any leaking or any urgency when you're doing the exercise, because that suggests you're over challenging the pelvic floor," O'Brien says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-squeeze-and-lift" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-squeeze-and-lift"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

"Squeeze the rectum and try to lift the rectum internally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squeeze for 10 seconds, then release for five seconds 10 times in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more tips on how to effectively do pelvic floor squeezes, read our &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/a-pelvic-floor-expert-says-70-percent-of-her-patients-do-squeezes-incorrectly-these-are-her-tips-on-getting-the-most-out-of-kegels" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/a-pelvic-floor-expert-says-70-percent-of-her-patients-do-squeezes-incorrectly-these-are-her-tips-on-getting-the-most-out-of-kegels"&gt;full guide to pelvic floor kegels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-squat" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-squat"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

							&lt;p&gt;You know those people who make you do a double-take when you find out their real age? The ones who look 40 when they're pushing 60, or seem frozen at 50 while celebrating their 70th birthday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've all met them. And while we might assume they hit the genetic lottery, the truth is more encouraging than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While genetics do play a role in how we age, our daily habits have an enormous impact on whether we look and feel younger than our chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't expensive treatments, invasive procedures, or extreme lifestyle overhauls we're talking about. Instead, they're consistent, often simple choices that compound over time. Small decisions made day after day that either accelerate or decelerate the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part? It's never too late to start incorporating these habits. Whether you're 25 or 65, your body responds to positive changes faster than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what exactly are these age-defying habits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They prioritize quality sleep every single night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever notice how a bad night's sleep makes you look like you've aged five years overnight?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's actual science behind this. As Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at &lt;em&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9059444-sleep-is-the-single-most-effective-thing-we-can-do"&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;: "Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who look decades younger treat sleep like a non-negotiable appointment with themselves. They're not scrolling their phones until midnight or binge-watching shows until 2 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, they've figured out their optimal sleep schedule and stick to it religiously. Seven to nine hours isn't just a suggestion for them—it's a non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They avoid smoking like their youth depends on it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's something that might sound obvious, but it's worth spelling out: smoking is basically a time machine that fast-forwards your appearance by decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted by the folks at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/ss/slideshow-ways-smoking-affects-looks"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; "Smoking changes the skin, teeth, and hair in ways that can add years to your looks". And we're not just talking about a subtle difference here—we're talking about dramatic, visible aging that's often irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen before-and-after photos of identical twins where one smoked and the other didn't. The difference after just a few years is striking—deeper wrinkles, duller skin, yellowed teeth, and an overall aged appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news? Your body starts repairing itself almost immediately after you quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They move their bodies with purpose and intensity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to know a secret that sounds too good to be true? Exercise might literally slow the clock on your cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://universe.byu.edu/2017/06/28/byu-research-suggests-exercise-reverses-cellular-aging-process1/"&gt;Research by professor Larry Tucker&lt;/a&gt; suggests that individuals who consistently engage in vigorous exercise can have cells that are as much as nine years younger than those of people who lead sedentary lives. Nine years! Let that sink in for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes sense to me. The people I know who look decades younger have made physical activity a non-negotiable part of their routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean they're all marathon runners or gym rats. But they do something that gets their heart pumping and their body working hard on a regular basis. Maybe it's cycling, swimming, dancing, or hitting the weights—the key is consistency and intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They protect their skin from sun damage religiously&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a question: what's the single biggest factor that makes someone look older than their years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you guessed sun damage, you're spot on. As &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6047276/"&gt;noted by experts&lt;/a&gt;, "exposure to UV radiation is the primary factor of extrinsic skin aging; it accounts for about 80% of facial aging."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this lesson the hard way after years of California beach days without proper protection. The difference between the covered and uncovered parts of my body tells the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who look remarkably young treat sunscreen like brushing their teeth—it's just part of their daily routine. They understand that a few extra minutes of protection now saves them decades of visible aging later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's probably the simplest anti-aging strategy that exists, yet so many people skip it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They manage stress before it manages them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, people who look decades younger have mastered the art of not letting life's inevitable stresses show up on their face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they meditate, maybe they journal, maybe they have weekly therapy sessions, or maybe they've just learned to let things go faster than most of us. The method matters less than the consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not talking about people who never experience stress—that's impossible. I'm talking about people who've learned to move through stress rather than marinate in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They understand that holding onto tension, worry, and frustration doesn't just feel bad—it looks bad too. So they've prioritized finding ways to release it regularly rather than carrying it around like invisible baggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing about looking decades younger than your actual age: it's not about finding the fountain of youth or having perfect genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's about making choices today that your future self will thank you for tomorrow. Every night of quality sleep, every workout, every day you protect your skin—these small decisions compound into something remarkable over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who look 40 at 60 didn't stumble into it accidentally. They built these habits deliberately, often starting years before they could see the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what gives me hope: your body is constantly regenerating itself. The choices you make today start showing up faster than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So which of these habits resonates most with you? Which one feels like the easiest place to start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you don't have to overhaul your entire life overnight. Pick one habit, make it stick, then add another. Your future self is counting on the decisions you make right now.&lt;/p&gt;

She became addicted to the devices when she used them to quit smoking cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-five knew the vapes weren't the best for her lungs, but she kept puffing, believing they were a better option than her previous vice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In July, however, she woke up in the middle of the night with 'sharp pains' in her chest, gasping for air as she struggled to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was terrified at the pain and I felt like I was going to die as I was scared I was going to not be able to breathe at all,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eyes rushed to the emergency department, where scans quickly revealed she had&lt;span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14615005/Rapid-rise-vaping-Britain-appears-stalled-users-anticipate-Government-crackdown.html"&gt; bronchiolitis obliterans, better known as 'popcorn lung'.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is a rare type of lung disease, triggered by inflammation in bronchioles, the smallest airways in the lungs, which become scarred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors also found an oily substance building up in Eyes' lungs, which they said was the fluid she had breathed in from puffing on her vape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cloey Eyes (pictured), 25, from Florida, said she used vapes constantly in the lead-up to her hospitalization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I woke up at 2:30am in the morning and my chest felt like it was having a heart attack,' Eyes said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had really bad pains in my chest and had to lean over. I couldn't catch my breath and I had to hit myself in the chest multiple times to be able to catch my breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was a sharp pain in my chest, but it also was a suffocating feeling.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said scans initially detected an 'oil pocket' in her left lung, before the same was also found in her right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors found that both lungs also had vape oil around them, though they weren't able to tell how much had collected in her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was scary to hear this,' she said. 'It's the oil from the vape and this is thickening up as you [breathe it in] and attaching itself to your lungs'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare instances, vapes have been linked to lipoid pneumonia, a condition where oily substances inhaled while puffing on e-cigarettes build up in the lungs causing inflammation and damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients normally suffer from a chronic cough, shortness of breath and coughing up blood or blood-tinged mucus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physicians say there is no good treatment for the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In cases of bronchiolitis obliterans, steroids and an inhaler can reduce inflammation and help with breathing - in severe cases, a lung transplant may be required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with the condition require life-long care to manage their symptoms and are advised to avoid air pollution, cigarette smoke, and people who are ill and could pass on infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eyes is pictured above in the hospital while she received treatment for popcorn lung and fluid build up in the organs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'There isn't a good treatment for lipoid pneumonia, other than supportive care, while the lungs heal on their own,' Dr &lt;span&gt;Stephen Broderick, a lung cancer surgeon at Johns Hopkins University, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/what-does-vaping-do-to-your-lungs#:~:text=Vaping%2DRelated%20Lipoid%20Pneumonia,Symptoms%20of%20lipoid%20pneumonia%20include:"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The single most important thing you can do is identify what is causing it - in this case vaping - and eliminate it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eyes revealed she would use rechargeable disposable vapes, throwing them away when they 'ran out of juice'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She would puff on the device more than 300 times a day, and get through a 5,000-puff device every two weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although she would pick a different flavor every time, she said she would always opt for fruity varieties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She started smoking cigarettes in 2020 shortly before the Covid pandemic, but quit in August 2023 because she 'hated the smell'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;That's when she started using vapes instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I used the vape more than when I smoked as it was handy and right there,' she said of her addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I was smoking, the pack [20 cigarettes] would last me four days, so I would smoke around five cigarettes a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I knew vaping wasn't any better than smoking, I just hated the smell of the smoke [from cigarettes] and needed to stop.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eyes' condition was severe, and she had to stay overnight at the hospital before she was prescribed antibiotics, an inhaler and cough suppressant medications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mom claimed doctors said it would take her lungs at least a year to heal completely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Popcorn lung&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is linked to diacetyl, a chemical compound found in some vapes and used to make different flavors for the devices. This is breathed in and causes inflammation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Warning signs of the condition include coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing, tiredness and night sweats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eyes (pictured) says she has now quit vapes, and urges others to do the same&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Several vapers have now come forward to reveal they were diagnosed with popcorn lung after using the devices, although it is not clear how many cases have been linked to the devices nationwide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In some cases, vapes have also been linked to heart attacks caused by the devices triggering inflammation in the blood and raising blood pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eyes has now quit vaping, and says she would 'never pick up a vape again'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I went cold turkey and quit vaping,' she said. 'I feel 10 times better now as I have stopped completely. My lungs feel better and I don't feel out of breath all the time...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would tell people to put the vape down, especially if you're a parent.

He initially thought stress, years of smoking, and heavy drinking might have played a role. However, as facts emerged, it became clear the cancer was linked to a different culprit altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did Michael Douglas think caused his cancer (and what it really was)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When diagnosed in August 2010, Douglas publicly suggested that long-term alcohol and tobacco use, along with stress, might have contributed to his cancer. He admitted that stress, especially relating to his son’s incarceration at the time, also weighed on his mind. Later, in a candid 2013 interview, the American actor and producer mentioned human papillomavirus (HPV) tied to oral sex as a possible cause. In a quite uncanny manner, parallels were drawn between him starring in films like ‘Basic Instinct’, ‘Fatal Attraction’, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;His initial symptoms, like persistent throat or ear pain, were misdiagnosed as infection, until a physician in Montreal peered deep into his throat and a tumor was spotted at the base of his tongue. A biopsy confirmed stage IV squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, an advanced form of oral cancer, prompting immediate treatment with chemotherapy and radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The real culprit: HPV, not habits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Douglas made headlines when he suggested his cancer was caused by HPV, a sexually transmitted virus, possibly contracted through oral sex. He remarked: “this particular cancer is caused by HPV … which actually comes about from cunnilingus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, his representatives clarified he was speaking broadly about HPV-linked cancers, not necessarily his own case. They added that he did not definitively state that oral sex caused his personal cancer, and emphasized that HPV is a known risk factor for oropharyngeal cancers, but not necessarily the direct cause in every case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is HPV and why does it matter in oral cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPV, or Human Papillomavirus, is a common viral infection that can cause various health problems. It is primarily transmitted through sexual contact and affects the skin and mucous membranes, with over 200 identified types. While many HPV infections are harmless and resolve on their own, some types can lead to serious complications like genital warts and certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPV is categorized into low-risk and high-risk types. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Low-risk HPV:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; These types can cause genital warts but are not typically associated with cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;High-risk HPV:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; These types can lead to various cancers, including cervical, vaginal, penile, anal, and throat cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPV is now recognized as a major risk factor for this type of cancer, particularly in the back of the throat, tonsils, and base of the tongue. While HPV infection is common, it usually clears up on its own. However, in some cases, it can persist and lead to the development of cancer years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPV-related throat cancers are becoming increasingly common. In fact, HPV now accounts for a majority of oropharyngeal cancer cases, especially among men. These cancers often strike adults who are non-smokers and non-heavy drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is squamous cell carcinoma?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a type of cancer that develops from squamous cells, which are flat, scale-like cells found in the skin and other tissues. It's the second most common type of skin cancer, after basal cell carcinoma, and can also occur in other areas like the lungs, head and neck, and cervix. SCC is often caused by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squamous cells are a type of epithelial cell, meaning they form the lining of surfaces throughout the body, including the skin, respiratory tract, and digestive tract. They are flat and scale-like, resembling fish scales under a microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While SCC is commonly found on sun-exposed areas of the skin like the face, scalp, and hands, it can also develop in other locations, including: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Skin:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the most common site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Lungs:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lung cancer can sometimes be of the squamous cell type. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Head and neck:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; This includes cancers of the mouth, throat, and voice box. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Cervix:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cervical cancer can also be squamous cell carcinoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Other locations:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; SCC can also occur in the nasal cavity, sinuses, and tear ducts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can HPV cause SCC?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some types of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) can cause squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Specifically, high-risk HPV types, like HPV-16 and HPV-18, are strongly linked to the development of certain squamous cell carcinomas, particularly in the oropharynx (the middle part of the throat). HPV infection is a significant risk factor for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risk factors&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCC risk factors include excessive sun exposure, fair skin, a history of sunburns, older age, male gender, immunosuppression, and certain genetic syndromes apart from those stemming from HPV. Lifestyle factors like smoking and heavy alcohol consumption also increase the risk. Additionally, chronic wounds, exposure to radiation or arsenic, and a history of other skin cancers can be contributing factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a detailed look:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun exposure is the most significant risk factor, particularly for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Cumulative sun damage over time, especially during youth, increases the risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fair skin:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Individuals with fair skin (Fitzpatrick skin types I-III) are more susceptible due to lower melanin levels, which offer less protection against UV radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="96"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Age:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The incidence of SCC rises with age, with most cases occurring in individuals over 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="99"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Gender:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Males are generally at a higher risk of developing SCC compared to females. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="103"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Immunosuppression:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weakened immune systems, often due to medications or organ transplants, make individuals more vulnerable to SCC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="106"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Genetic predisposition:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certain inherited conditions and genetic mutations (like TP53, CDKN2A, Ras, and NOTCH1) can increase susceptibility to SCC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="109"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Smoking and alcohol consumption:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heavy smoking and excessive alcohol intake are strongly linked to SCC, particularly in the oral cavity and esophagus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="113"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Chronic wounds and scarring:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Persistent wounds, burns, or scars can create an environment where SCC can develop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="116"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Arsenic exposure:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long-term exposure to arsenic, through drinking water or occupational settings, can increase the risk of SCC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="119"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Actinic keratosis:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; These are precancerous skin lesions caused by sun damage and are a significant risk factor for cSCC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="122"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Oral hygiene:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Poor oral hygiene and dental problems can contribute to oral SCC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="126"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Family history:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; A family history of skin cancer can increase an individual's risk of developing SCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="129"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="130"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention and treatment&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="131"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin, it's crucial to minimize sun exposure and avoid tanning beds. Regularly using sunscreen with at least SPF 30, seeking shade during peak sun hours, and wearing protective clothing like hats and long sleeves are essential steps. Annual skin exams, especially for those with risk factors like a history of sun exposure or family history of skin cancer, are also recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="134"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squamous cell skin cancer treatment options include surgery (excision, Mohs surgery), radiation therapy, and topical or systemic medications, depending on the cancer's size, location, and stage. For early-stage, small cancers, less invasive procedures like curettage and electrodesiccation, cryosurgery, or photodynamic therapy might be sufficient. For advanced cases, or when surgery is not an option, radiation therapy or medications like imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil may be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="136"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Douglas, the actor underwent aggressive chemotherapy and radiation treatments and has been cancer-free since 2011, though he continues with regular check-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="138"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Sanjay Dutt on his battle with cancer: 'It all comes down to willpower and keeping the faith'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="140"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="141"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 03:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>微塑料正在渗透你的大脑。有什么影响？ - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQUDI4R2pGb1pieDVNNVJtekZvTklnODR5UVZBLWhONk1rZmV6c1RocmNwcU51ZEpZdmdVNUZqR3EtTWFkaU5MWUFheXl5bkJneFUwWnNWLXhHc3I4YzZwcVBPQVVOcTVuQUktYmNGQzVQNkpIaDNSNXdvZ2RybVFUWGRhekFiUms5UzE1M1MxQ21yZTFnS0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Tiny shards of plastic called microplastics &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-could-accumulate-in-our-brains-more-than-in-kidneys-and-livers"&gt;have been detected&lt;/a&gt; accumulating in human brains, but there is not yet enough evidence to say whether this is doing us harm, experts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mostly invisible pieces of plastic have been found everywhere from the top of mountains to the bottom of oceans, in the air we breathe and the food we eat. They have also been discovered riddled throughout human bodies, inside lungs, hearts, placentas and even crossing the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increasing ubiquity of microplastics has become a key issue in efforts to hammer out the world's first plastic pollution treaty, with the latest round of UN talks being held in Geneva next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-detected-infiltrating-human-brains-for-the-first-time"&gt;Microplastics Detected Infiltrating Human Brains For The First Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects that microplastics and even smaller nanoplastics have on human health is not yet fully understood, but researchers have been working to find out more in this relatively new field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most prominent study looking at microplastics in brains was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-03453-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; in February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists tested brain tissue from 28 people who died in 2016 and 24 who died last year in the US state of New Mexico, finding that the amount of microplastics in the samples increased over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study made headlines around the world when the lead researcher, US toxicologist Matthew Campen, told the media that they detected the equivalent of a plastic spoon's worth of microplastics in the brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170290" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170290" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/spoon_microplastic_642.jpg" alt="microplastic in a metal spoon" class="wp-image-170290 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/spoon_microplastic_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/spoon_microplastic_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/spoon_microplastic_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170290" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Plastic fragments in the environment break up into microscopic particles.

&lt;p&gt;In the span of a couple of months, she broke both hips and fractured her shoulder, confining her to a wheelchair. Immobility and subpar care led to a gruesome pressure wound on her foot that her depleted, 65-pound body could never heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of society insists on keeping a person alive in that condition? In her predementia days, my mom — always quick with a joke or a biting comment — would have said, “Just get a gun and shoot me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mom died last year, the day before Mother’s Day, I cried with both sorrow at her unfair, horrible ending and with relief that it was finally over. Yet, the nagging question remained about my own uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caring for my parents, I’d become increasingly obsessed with the idea that I was doomed to spend my final years in a dreary care facility surrounded by strangers, just waiting for the end to come. While I realize that having kids does not guarantee that they will someday take care of you, I also know that there is a zero percent chance that your nonexistent offspring will do it. This thought filled me with a crushing sense of fear and foreboding about getting older. That is, until I resolved to plan my own death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea surfaced gradually from some hidden cranny of my subconscious, reminding me of my favorite movie since high school: “Harold and Maude.” In this 1971 dark comedy starring the great Ruth Gordon, a morbid young man falls in love with a free-spirited septuagenarian. In the film’s climax, Maude carries out a long-held plan to end her life on her 80th birthday, on her own unconventional terms. Why shouldn’t I be like Maude? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought my death would have to be a DIY affair. I knew that if I wasn’t going to die from an incurable illness within six months, or if I had dementia, that would disqualify me from the “medical aid in dying” options offered by a growing number of states. Though well intentioned, these programs are so mired in bureaucracy and restrictions that even patients who qualify often die while waiting for approvals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocacy groups like &lt;a href="https://deathwithdignity.org/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7919746" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Death With Dignity&lt;/a&gt; are working to streamline and expand end-of-life options across the country, but the wheels turn slowly. And if you have dementia, like my mom, or just feel like you’ve had a good run after 90 years on the planet? No soup for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determining how to bring about a dignified, pain-free ending without medical help was a daunting prospect, so I began workshopping the idea — only half-joking — with friends. Would my college pal, an anesthesiologist, be willing to risk prison time to help me out? What kind of bribe money would I need to convince a veterinarian to do the deed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in the months after my mom’s death, an acquaintance recommended Amy Bloom’s “In Love: A Memoir of Love and Loss,” a heartbreaking book that chronicles the author’s journey to Zurich to witness the assisted death of her husband, who’d been diagnosed with early Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;

"When in doubt, throw it out," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potent neurotoxin can cause botulism, a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/rare-diseases" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rare but serious illness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;rare but serious illness&lt;/a&gt; that attacks the nerves, leading to muscle paralysis, breathing difficulty, and even death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home-canned, low-acid foods including green beans, asparagus, corn, meats, garlic and fermented fish are the most risky, Picone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent botulism, the CDC recommends refrigerating or freezing leftovers promptly after cooking, throwing away damaged or bulging cans, and following the USDA's guide to home-canning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Large reef fish like barracudas can contain ciguatoxins that cause ciguatera fish poisoning in humans.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I like eating fish, but I try to avoid eating large tropical reef fish like barracuda, grouper and Amberjack because of a neurotoxin called ciguatoxin," Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ciguatoxin is a neurotoxin produced by certain algae in coral reefs as a defense mechanism. It can travel up the food chain from herbivorous fish to carnivorous fish and eventually humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/death-confirmed-rare-deadly-brain-eating-amoeba-southern-lake" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Death Confirmed From Rare And Deadly 'Brain-eating Amoeba' In Southern Lake;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Death Confirmed From Rare And Deadly 'Brain-eating Amoeba' In Southern Lake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurological symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neurological symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of ciguatoxin poisoning can include feelings of tingling and numbness, reverse temperature sensations where hot objects feel cold and cold objects feel hot, and vivid nightmares, Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 50,000 cases of ciguatera poisoning are reported worldwide annually, according to the CDC, but the numbers may be higher because it is often misdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;One neurologist avoids eating large tropical fish because they can cause ciguatera poisoning.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The toxin is heat-stable, he added, so cooking the fish won't destroy it. "This doesn't mean you can't eat fish," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just avoid or limit consumption of large predatory fish, avoid eating certain parts, like the liver or roe, and be aware of endemic areas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ciguatera is common in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and the Caribbean Sea, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen said he does not eat &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:under-cooked pork,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;under-cooked pork,&lt;/a&gt; especially from unregulated sources, because of the risk of neurocysticercosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurocysticercosis occurs after a person swallows pork tapeworm eggs, according to the CDC. The larvae migrate to tissues like the brain and form cysts, which are diagnosed when found in the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A little-known fact is that it's actually one of the leading causes of acquired epilepsy worldwide," Chen said of the infection.

"This type of information ... I feel should be jumped on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauren Vlachos, executive director of the Alzheimer's Disease Resource Center in East Islip, called the finding "an exciting moment in Alzheimer's research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The recent Harvard study showing lithium orotate reversing Alzheimer’s-like changes in mice is a major breakthrough, offering renewed hope for treatment and even prevention," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vlachos said it was crucial to continue funding research, but also to move such findings into clinical trials. "Discovery is only part of the equation," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One expert on Long Island cautioned the study was a preliminary finding and people should not go out and start taking lithium pills.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marc Gordon, chief of neurology for Northwell’s Zucker Hillside, North Shore University Hospital and Long Island Jewish Medical Center, said the study was "interesting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I’m concerned that people are going to completely misinterpret it and think that they've got to start popping lithium carbonate and get toxic," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Dr. Bruce A. Yankner, a professor of genetics and neurology at Harvard Medical School, found that researchers could reverse Alzheimer's in mice and restore brain functions using small amounts of the compound lithium orotate. The amount given was enough to mimic the metal’s natural level in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study were reported in the scientific journal Nature on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The obvious impact is that because lithium orotate is dirt cheap, hopefully we will get rigorous, randomized trials testing this very, very quickly," Matt Kaeberlein, former director of the Healthy Aging and Longevity Research Institute at the University of Washington, who did not participate in the study, told The Washington Post. "And I would say that it will be an embarrassment to the Alzheimer’s clinical community if that doesn’t happen right away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yankner, who is also the co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for Biology of Aging Research at Harvard, told The Post: "I do not recommend that people take lithium at this point, because it has not been validated as a treatment in humans. We always have to be cautious because things can change as you go from mice to humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yankner said other labs still needed to validate the findings of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen said the fact the study was done with mice "doesn't mean that it can't be ... taken seriously" and possibly applied to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is a form of dementia that affects memory, thinking and behavior. More than 7 million people in the United States over the age of 65 have Alzheimer's, according to the Alzheimer's Association, a Chicago-based nonprofit which predicts that number will rise to almost 13 million by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there have been some recent breakthroughs in treating Alzheimer's, researchers have not discovered a medication to stop or reverse it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with bipolar disorder are often prescribed lithium, and some previous research has suggested it could help with Alzheimer’s and also serve as an antiaging medication. One 2017 study in Denmark suggested that lithium found in drinking water could be associated with a lower incident of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Over the course of a year, patients taking vortioxetine showed larger improvements in measures of memory, attention, and reasoning, as well as a greater reduction in depressive symptoms, than those taking escitalopram, paroxetine, or bupropion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia in older adults, gradually impairing a person’s ability to carry out daily activities. Alongside cognitive decline, many people with Alzheimer’s also experience neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and apathy. Depression in Alzheimer’s is common and can intensify the difficulties posed by memory loss and disorientation, while also worsening quality of life for both patients and caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high prevalence of depression in Alzheimer’s has led to increased prescribing of antidepressants in this population. Yet research on how these drugs affect cognitive function has been limited and sometimes conflicting. Certain antidepressants may worsen cognition due to side effects on neurotransmitter systems, while others could potentially support brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vortioxetine is of particular interest because, beyond its action on serotonin receptors, it also influences other neurotransmitter systems involved in learning and memory. Previous studies in people with depression and in those with mild cognitive impairment have hinted at cognitive benefits, but few have directly compared vortioxetine to multiple other antidepressants in patients with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, researchers Eduardo Cumbo and Daniela Migliore conducted a 12-month randomized, open-label study at the Neurodegenerative Disorders Unit in Caltanissetta, Italy. The analysis focused on 108 outpatients with mild Alzheimer’s disease and depressive symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either vortioxetine (n=36) or one of three other antidepressants—escitalopram, paroxetine, or bupropion (n=72 in total)—while continuing standard Alzheimer’s treatments such as cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine. Patients were assessed at the start of the study, after six months, and after twelve months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive function was measured using several established tests. The Mini-Mental State Examination evaluated overall cognitive ability, including memory, orientation, and language. The Attentive Matrices test measured selective attention, while the Coloured Progressive Matrices assessed nonverbal reasoning and problem-solving. The Digit Span task tested verbal working memory. Depression severity was measured with the Hamilton Depression Scale and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the study, patients in all groups showed some improvement on cognitive tests, but gains were generally largest and most consistent in the vortioxetine group. On the Mini-Mental State Examination, vortioxetine-treated patients improved by nearly three points, a statistically significant change. They also showed significant gains in selective attention and nonverbal reasoning, while patients on other antidepressants tended to improve less, and in some cases, not significantly. Working memory scores improved slightly in the vortioxetine group but did not reach statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When comparing groups directly, vortioxetine outperformed the other antidepressants on most cognitive measures. The difference was particularly notable when compared to paroxetine, which has anticholinergic properties that can impair cognition in older adults. Escitalopram and bupropion showed moderate improvements on some attention measures, but not to the same extent as vortioxetine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that depressive symptoms decreased in all groups over the 12-month period, but the reduction was more pronounced in patients taking vortioxetine. On both depression scales, the vortioxetine group’s scores dropped by about seven points from baseline—an improvement considered clinically meaningful. Between-group comparisons showed that vortioxetine’s effect on depressive symptoms was statistically superior to that of the other antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects were relatively uncommon and generally mild. Nausea and headache were the most frequently reported with vortioxetine, occurring in about 8% of patients. Two participants—one on paroxetine and one on bupropion—discontinued treatment due to side effects. No serious adverse events or deaths occurred during the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note some limitations. The trial was conducted at a single site with a modest sample size, which may limit how well the findings apply to the wider Alzheimer’s population. It was also open-label, meaning patients and doctors knew which treatment was being given, which could introduce bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, only patients with mild Alzheimer’s were included, so the results may not extend to those with more advanced disease. The study also could not determine whether the observed cognitive improvements were due directly to vortioxetine’s pharmacological effects or indirectly through relief of depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that vortioxetine may have cognitive benefits beyond its antidepressant effects. The authors suggest that larger, longer-term, and double-blind studies are needed to confirm these results and to clarify how vortioxetine’s effects on neurotransmitter systems might influence both mood and cognition in people with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future research confirms these findings, vortioxetine could be considered a particularly useful option for Alzheimer’s patients who experience depression—addressing not only mood symptoms but also potentially helping to preserve certain cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13872877251340084" target="_blank"&gt;Differential effects of antidepressants on cognition in Alzheimer’s disease with depression: A sub-group analysis of an open-label, observational study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Eduardo Cumbo and Daniela Migliore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 20:03:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOejg4ZXZYWUtrRVNJaEJCbjY4WGpaMUQta2ZWb0RqQmhpenpsNC1LX2pTbUF1YjMzN1JBSGgxVE1zdFRYYl9UY0xmbWsyLXJCTVp0M3poMGZlaFZ2ZFBpWUFvUk1YaDFiWUhMbnY4cXJHNWtVVXFIWG5ZOXVTR2duZ3laNjhOWWt5bVExeEJpdjh0aEdPT0tQUkxNd2dRcEIzZ3FlY3I0dWhva29IOVFUMnFqQ0pWVkQxbFdhTEdONHVWRjQ</guid></item><item><title>天然化合物组合恢复老化的脑细胞-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE0yN1NBMDFkckF3VzhEXzQ2a3VWbjRtelBZN1NVRmcxejctRjlFTGVaRlA5YkNrTTdrQWNESF9JZXB4dFhuQVQxRXpHcklRZ0ZjMmhzd2lDYi1sYVVGZnl0MTU1bHNjR2Y1SjFLZDI1UjdNdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Scientists have identified a natural compound combination that reverses aging-related brain cell decline and removes harmful Alzheimer’s-linked proteins. The treatment, combining nicotinamide (vitamin B3) and the green tea antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate, restores guanosine triphosphate (GTP) levels—critical for neuronal energy and protein cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In aged neurons, the restored energy boosted protein clearance, reduced oxidative stress, and reactivated key cell trafficking pathways. The findings suggest a potential non-drug strategy for combating Alzheimer’s, though more work is needed to optimize delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Restoration:&lt;/strong&gt; Nicotinamide and green tea antioxidant revived GTP levels in aged neurons to youthful levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein Clearance Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; Treatment improved the brain’s ability to remove toxic amyloid beta aggregates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Pharmaceutical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings point to a supplement-based approach for Alzheimer’s prevention or therapy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Irvine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at the University of California, Irvine have identified a promising nonpharmaceutical treatment that rejuvenates aging brain cells and clears away the buildup of harmful proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper published recently in the journal &lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;, the UC Irvine team reports that a combination of naturally occurring compounds – nicotinamide (a form of vitamin B3) and epigallocatechin gallate (a green tea antioxidant) – can reinstate levels of guanosine triphosphate, an essential energy molecule in brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112113"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/suppliments-aging-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;“We found that restoring energy levels helps neurons regain this critical cleanup function.” Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tests on neurons in a dish, the treatment reversed age-related cellular deficits and improved the brain cells’ ability to clear damaging amyloid protein aggregates, an Alzheimer’s hallmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As people age, their brains show a decline in neuronal energy levels, which limits the ability to remove unwanted proteins and damaged components,” said lead author Gregory Brewer, adjunct professor of biomedical engineering at UC Irvine. “We found that restoring energy levels helps neurons regain this critical cleanup function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor called GEVAL to track live guanosine triphosphate levels in neurons from aged Alzheimer’s model mice. They discovered that free GTP levels declined with age – particularly in mitochondria, the cells’ energy hubs – leading to impaired autophagy, the process by which cells eliminate damaged components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when aged neurons were treated for just 24 hours with nicotinamide and epigallocatechin gallate, GTP levels were restored to those typically seen in younger cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This revival triggered a cascade of benefits: improved energy metabolism; activation of key GTPases involved in cellular trafficking, Rab7 and Arl8b; and efficient clearance of amyloid beta aggregates. Oxidative stress, another contributor to neurodegeneration, was also reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study highlights GTP as a previously underappreciated energy source driving vital brain functions,” Brewer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By supplementing the brain’s energy systems with compounds that are already available as dietary supplements, we may have a new path toward treating age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cautioned, “More work is going to be required to find the best way to administer this treatment, since a recent clinical trial involving UC Irvine researchers showed that oral nicotinamide was not very effective because of inactivation in the bloodstream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brewer’s collaborators were Ricardo Santana, a UC Irvine associate specialist in biomedical engineering, and Joshua McWhirt, a UC Irvine junior specialist who’s now a Ph.D. candidate at the Medical University of South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding was provided by the National Institutes of Health and the UC Irvine Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this supplements and brain aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#52302230373e3e1227313b7c373627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brian Bell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uci.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Irvine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Brian Bell – UC Irvine&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11357-025-01786-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Treatment of age-related decreases in GTP levels restores endocytosis and autophagy&lt;/a&gt;” by Gregory Brewer et al. &lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment of age-related decreases in GTP levels restores endocytosis and autophagy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age-related declines in neuronal bioenergetic levels may limit vesicular trafficking and autophagic clearance of damaged organelles and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age-related ATP depletion would impact cognition dependent on ionic homeostasis, but limits on proteostasis powered by GTP are less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used neurons isolated from aged 3xTg-AD Alzheimer’s model mice and a novel genetically encoded fluorescent GTP sensor (GEVAL) to evaluate live GTP levels in situ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report an age-dependent reduction in ratiometric measurements of free/bound GTP levels in living hippocampal neurons. Free GTP colocalized in the mitochondria decreased with age accompanied by the accumulation of free GTP-labeled vesicular structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The energy dependence of autophagy was demonstrated by depletion of GTP with rapamycin stimulation, while bafilomycin inhibition of autophagy raised GTP levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four-hour supplementation of aged neurons with the NAD precursor nicotinamide and the Nrf2 redox modulator EGCG restored GTP levels to youthful levels and mobilized endocytosis and lysosomal consumption for autophagy via the respective GTPases Rab7 and Arl8b.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vesicular mobilization promoted the clearance of intraneuronal Aβ aggregates, improved viability, and lowered protein oxidative nitration in AD model neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results reveal age- and AD-related neuronal GTP energy deficits that impair autophagy and endocytosis. GTP deficits were remediated by an external NAD precursor together with a Nrf2 redox modulator which suggests a translational path.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 19:53:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE0yN1NBMDFkckF3VzhEXzQ2a3VWbjRtelBZN1NVRmcxejctRjlFTGVaRlA5YkNrTTdrQWNESF9JZXB4dFhuQVQxRXpHcklRZ0ZjMmhzd2lDYi1sYVVGZnl0MTU1bHNjR2Y1SjFLZDI1UjdNdw</guid></item><item><title>晚上咬牙切齿？以下是修复方法-泰晤士报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNWXJ0VEczS2VYNC1NZGhkT1NsT1J2VlFPa3lwbGExV1dIWjVhUFk3Q0I0SW90NXd6R0hTZ0NobnktSWhISXV6MDR1bDJJdXpkMWZhUGpKM0ltQVBZeGFscWJoSDhpcVUxczZMT05WX3p1M0xmQzVCLXVoRU1IZGh5bzVEaWsxamZrRncwVDdtWFBGTDdLeXpLcWc4d29BZVVaZmhV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 gJBkaT"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;span class="responsive__DropCap-sc-1pktst5-1 enuiNL"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;f you consistently wake up with an aching jaw, you could be suffering from teeth grinding — or bruxism, to give it its medical term. One in ten people in the UK suffer from the condition, which can also cause cracked and flattened teeth, receding gums and headaches, according to the Bruxism Association dental clinic. Why do we gnash our teeth without realising (often in our sleep) and how do we stop it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“The main cause is stress, hands down,” says Dr Anni Seaborne, head of general dentistry at Bupa Dental Care. If you don’t have a way to release stress, it sits in your body and can come out as clenching and grinding teeth when you’re awake or asleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;People with ADHD are also&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; more prone to grinding their teeth, and “some prescription medications, particularly antidepressants such as SSRIs, can also trigger or worsen bruxism,” says Dr Anjum Jahan, a cosmetic dentist who compares grinding your teeth to furrowing your brow or hunching your shoulders without realising.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Women are slightly more likely than men to grind their teeth, but it’s unclear whether this is down to higher rates of reporting or hormonal factors. “There’s some evidence hormonal contraceptives and HRT may play a role in muscle tension, although more research is needed,” Jahan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/jaw-clenching-how-to-stop-vn6kzzkd5" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is stress making you clench your jaw without realising? What to do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Other causes can include sleep apnea, consuming large amounts of stimulants such as alcohol or caffeine, and an uneven bite — a condition called malocclusion. A dentist who specialises in jaw pain should be able to tell if a misaligned bite is behind your bruxism: look for clinics that offer treatments for temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and seek second opinions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If malocclusion is not a factor, then there are lifestyle changes that can help you to manage bruxism. A custom-fitted night-time mouth guard made from acrylic or soft rubber can protect teeth from the wear and tear caused by grinding. “It also helps that some patients become aware of the clenching sensation, which can encourage behavioural change over time,” Jahan says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Some bruxism sufferers report an improvement after taking magnesium. “It is involved in muscle relaxation and nerve function,” says Dr Harpreet Sarna, chief medical officer at Vitality health insurance. A deficiency could lead to increased jaw tension, though supplements should be considered a precaution rather than a treatment. Other lifestyle factors include maintaining good sleep hygiene: try to go to bed and get up at the same time every day, limit screen time, cut out caffeine after 2pm and reduce your alcohol intake as it disrupts REM sleep, the stage when most grinding tends to happen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/how-to-avoid-getting-teeth-stains-dt8hk960l" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to avoid getting teeth stains&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Jaw physiotherapy, massage and osteopathy can help to relax the muscles surrounding the temporomandibular joint, which connects the lower jaw to the skull and takes the brunt of the pressure. A more extreme option is masseter Botox, where small amounts of botulinum toxin are injected into the masseter muscles, which are responsible for chewing, weakening them and reducing clenching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If you are worried, consult a dentist. They may offer biofeedback devices: wearables containing sensors that detect clenching and train you to stop doing it using vibration, sound or mild electrical stimulation, which the brain can process even while you are asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNWXJ0VEczS2VYNC1NZGhkT1NsT1J2VlFPa3lwbGExV1dIWjVhUFk3Q0I0SW90NXd6R0hTZ0NobnktSWhISXV6MDR1bDJJdXpkMWZhUGpKM0ltQVBZeGFscWJoSDhpcVUxczZMT05WX3p1M0xmQzVCLXVoRU1IZGh5bzVEaWsxamZrRncwVDdtWFBGTDdLeXpLcWc4d29BZVVaZmhV</guid></item><item><title>口交如何导致咽喉癌，迈克尔·道格拉斯分享了他被诊断时的反应- UNILAD</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxQSnYtUmRkT3hkSnJXWWNHbks1SWZwVllVWTlibUV4dkI4YXFlMW9IeTF0ZTVUZGFLaTRhVnlQRkp6T2JwSjJ1cC1aOXZib3o1M3dTRTZ3X2pnLU96bGhrSWhQSU00a2RrVjRUemdHWWV4a3FRTmJhYUxCQV8zbS1PdWs3US05Um0wODJvVDZGQWZPeG5NVDNjc3hpakk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After Michael Douglas shared how he developed throat cancer due to acts carried out in the bedroom, a study has revealed that oral sex can actually cause tumors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The New Jersey-born &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/celebrity"&gt;actor&lt;/a&gt; and film producer was &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/news/health/michael-douglas-throat-cancer-oral-intercourse-explained-963062-20250807"&gt;diagnosed with the devastating disease&lt;/a&gt; back in August 2010, and three years later he revealed in a bombshell interview with The Guardian that it was due to his excursions &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/sex-and-relationships"&gt;under the sheets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The celeb told the news outlet he suffered from oral discomfort for months and made various trips to medical appointments, until a friend's &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/health"&gt;doctor&lt;/a&gt; in Montreal examined his mouth and found the glaring problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I will always remember the look on his face," Douglas, who is married to Catherine Zeta-Jones, said.

Like your breakfast. If it’s high in &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057813/6-sneaky-signs-you-might-be-eating-too-much-salt/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hidden sodium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;hidden sodium&lt;/a&gt;, it could be slowly chipping away at your heart health, says cardiologist &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/robert-segal-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Robert Segel, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Robert Segel, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we’re not just talking about salty bacon or sausages. Sodium is often hiding in many breakfast staples that don’t even taste salty, like bread, bagels, muffins, pastries and more.  Given that &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/american-heart-association-redefined-heart-disease-risk-2023-8356291" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiovascular disease accounts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;cardiovascular disease accounts&lt;/a&gt; for 1 in 3 deaths in the U.S., it’s worth stepping back and reevaluating what’s on your plate before you start your busy day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to learn why a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/low-sodium-breakfast-recipes-8405129" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high-sodium breakfast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;high-sodium breakfast&lt;/a&gt; can spell trouble for your heart, plus morning habits to keep your heart in top shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How a High-Sodium Breakfast May Be Harming Your Heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can Raise Blood Pressure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“High sodium intake causes fluid retention, raises blood pressure and increases the risk of heart failure,” says Segel. Sodium is so problematic that research has found that people who eat a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882895/easy-ways-to-cut-sodium-in-your-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high-sodium diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;high-sodium diet&lt;/a&gt; may be 19% more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than people who follow a low-sodium eating pattern. The reason? Excess sodium disrupts the function of the system that regulates your blood pressure (called the renin-angiotensin system) and makes your heart work harder to pump blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us typically consume more than 3,300 milligrams of sodium every day. The American Heart Association recommends slashing that number by more than half to 1,500 mg per day for optimal heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;May Be High in Saturated Fat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If processed breakfast meats, like bacon and sausage, are your go-to morning protein sources, you aren’t just getting lots of gratuitous sodium. These meats are also high in &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-thing-to-limit-to-lower-cholesterol-11783649" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cholesterol-raising saturated fat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;cholesterol-raising saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;, delivering a double whammy when it comes to heart health. One study even found that eating slightly more than 5 ounces of processed meat weekly may increase the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894073/these-7-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-heart-disease-according-to-the-american-heart-association/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of major cardiovascular disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;risk of major cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; by as much as 46%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, there are plenty of &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7869497/quick-heart-healthy-breakfast-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:less-processed breakfast staples;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;less-processed breakfast staples&lt;/a&gt; that can give you the protein you need without all the sodium and saturated fat. Eggs, unsweetened yogurt and kefir, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7961621/the-best-low-sodium-cheeses-according-to-a-dietitian/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:low-sodium cottage cheese;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;low-sodium cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt; and even tuna are all top choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about turkey bacon or chicken sausage? As healthy as these may sound, they still fall under the processed meat umbrella, so steer clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Linked to Type 2 Diabetes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with diabetes have double the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7871737/inflammatory-foods-that-raise-heart-attack-stroke-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt; thanks to chronically high blood sugar, which damages the blood vessels.  So, maintaining healthy blood sugar levels can protect your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugary breakfast treats, like doughnuts and pastries, aren’t the only foods to watch out for to &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292264/5-foods-people-should-eat-every-day-to-help-prevent-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduce your diabetes risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;reduce your diabetes risk&lt;/a&gt;. Research reveals that a high-sodium eating pattern can also be a culprit. For instance, one study found that people whose diets contained the most sodium were 80% more likely to develop diabetes than people who ate the least sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Frequently Low in Fiber&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber is found in plant foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. While fiber is best known for keeping your digestive system regular, it also offers protection against heart disease and diabetes. Yet, most of us don’t come close to getting the roughly 28 grams we need per day. Catch is, there’s no fiber in bacon and sausage. And many breads, bagels and baked goods are also low in fiber, unless they’re made with lots of whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all fiber is a win, soluble fiber is the one you want for better heart health. This type of fiber binds to cholesterol in your intestine, ferrying it out of your body through your stool. To work more cholesterol-lowering soluble fiber into your morning, think oatmeal and fruits, like apples, pears, bananas and oranges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Morning Habits That Support Heart Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing the sodium in your breakfast is a great start for heart health. Now the question is: What do you eat (and do) instead? Here are a few totally doable habits to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydrate: &lt;/strong&gt;Rather than having a coffee-first routine, &lt;a href="https://www.mynetdiary.com/bio-kcampbell.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kiran Campbell, RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kiran Campbell, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, recommends starting your day with a glass of water. “Even mild dehydration can affect how hard your heart has to work,” she says. Getting H2O on board first helps support circulation, digestion and blood pressure regulation, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add in some fiber: &lt;/strong&gt;“Fiber helps lower total and LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and supports digestive and heart health,” says Campbell. She suggests aiming for at least 5 grams of fiber at breakfast. You can hit this quota by prioritizing fruits, vegetables and whole grains, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include high-quality protein: &lt;/strong&gt;“[Protein] helps keep blood sugar stable, reduces cravings, supports muscle mass and improves satiety, making it easier to eat mindfully the rest of the day,” says &lt;a href="https://biteswithblair.com/author/blairpersyn/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Blair Persyn, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Blair Persyn, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. She recommends starting your day with a breakfast that contains 20 to 30 grams of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid added sugars: &lt;/strong&gt;Excess intake of added sugars also increases the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke-11698358" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of stroke;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;risk of stroke&lt;/a&gt;, heart failure and atrial fibrillation, says Campbell. Whole fruits can be a nice source of natural sweetness at breakfast. If you drink coffee and tea, skip the sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move your body: &lt;/strong&gt;If you have the time, spending 10 to 15 minutes moving your body in the morning can help &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7919807/triumph-resistant-hypertension-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improve blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;improve blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and cholesterol levels and promote a healthy weight, says Campbell. That might be some yoga sun salutations, stretching or a walk outside. Bonus points if that walk happens after a meal, as it can also help lower blood sugar and improve digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build in some quiet time: &lt;/strong&gt;Rushing to get ready is a given in many of our morning routines. But Persyn recommends slowing down, even if it’s for just a moment. “Stress management is often overlooked when it comes to heart health, but it matters,” she says. “Even just 60 seconds of deep breathing or a moment of mindfulness before jumping into your day can make a meaningful difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek out the sun: &lt;/strong&gt;Morning light exposure has been found to help &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-bed-to-lower-blood-pressure-11777941" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduce blood pressure at night;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;reduce blood pressure at night&lt;/a&gt; and may be an additional way to support heart health, research suggests. Start your day with a leisurely walk outside, and you’ll double up on exercise and quiet time, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly eating a high-sodium breakfast could be harming your heart, according to a cardiologist. And many go-to breakfast foods like bacon, sausages, muffins, bagels and bread can be loaded with it. Not only can their sodium raise your blood pressure, it may also increase your risk of type 2 diabetes, which can double your risk of heart disease. If that weren’t trouble enough, many high-sodium breakfast staples are heavy in artery-clogging saturated fat, yet low in &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/underrated-nutrient-for-heart-health-11732192" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-friendly fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;heart-friendly fiber&lt;/a&gt;. So, reach for a breakfast that’s rich in fiber and lean protein, yet low in added sugars and sodium. While you’re at it, add a few heart-healthy habits to your a.m., like moving your body, scheduling a few moments of mindfulness or getting out in the sunlight. You’ll start your day on a positive note and do good things for your heart in the process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/morning-habit-that-could-be-harming-your-heart-11784652" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 14:48:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFBzV0J0RkVkRi03TXZTTjZUQjMzNzVITnVoSm4wZjZpVkdnd0pTclVtWWx5UmVrdU9FNmUzU2NqRFozNFNhaHBsTUZ0RGFETFpBVnhTdlVkcDd3dXJlMXprN01jbm11cjNrYjZOUm00ZUZyamM0MU84</guid></item><item><title>​从迷迭香水到口香糖： 5种令人惊讶的磨练大脑和提高记忆力的方法-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwJBVV95cUxPYUh6ZTEzQUg2d0F3c0MxSS1aa1FrVHdvUHo2WWZaUk8xdUpMVmdsRHRrNkliaVhEZk0wUVBSZkhURVQyNXNNMl9jYnJkVWV6Q1p0dFhXZEk0YnpmdGk3MzNqY0JLZVBBcF9HM1IxcGtZZ0Z5MTlrRko1WHJCd2pMalRxdFlaSUozTE5oYjBnWVAwa2g4dUNVbloxWVBjNWloYllmeU5LbldEbnZUZkZFLWRxQkhkMjlGQjRFdkJHai10NlpXbzhsWWljd1QtbzZqYUJwRjNZcURvWW9nb21CTTlWdnNJZG9lTXFNQW1PS0FwdFI0a19DYk1Ecjg5c0xUSE9jZXNwcVI1VndULTZESkxiNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;We all have those moments when we forget the purpose of us walking into that room, or spend way too much time trying to remember a name that just seems out of reach.

&lt;p&gt;"When you're asleep and have obstructed breathing, your body panics a little bit, releasing a bit of adrenaline into your bloodstream to wake you up enough to breathe. With Apnea, this can happen hundreds of times a night. Adrenaline is not good for you 300 times a night. It's great if you get surprised by a wild animal and need to run away or climb a tree, but otherwise, no good for you at all. It debilitates almost every major organ and metabolic system in your body. Long-term repeated exposure can really mess you up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you even THINK you might have a problem, get it checked out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;–&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1l51rha/comment/mwe4b3y/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank"&gt;u/JetScreamerBaby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To our immune system, naked RNA is a sign of a viral or bacterial invasion and must be attacked. But our own cells also have RNA. To ward off trouble, our cells clothe their RNA in sugars, Vijay Rathinam and colleagues at the UConn School of Medicine and Ryan Flynn at Boston Children's Hospital &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09310-6" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a family of large biological molecules fundamental to all forms of life, including &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/viruses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;, bacteria, and animals. Viruses as diverse as measles, influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and rabies all have RNA, which is why the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; starts attacking when it sees RNA in the bloodstream or in other inappropriate locations. But our own cells have RNA as well, sometimes displaying it on their surface, plain for roaming immune cells to see—and yet the immune system ignores it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Recognizing RNA as a sign of infection is problematic, as every &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/single+cell/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;single cell&lt;/a&gt; in our body has RNA," says UConn School of Medicine immunologist Vijay Rathinam. The question is, how does our immune system distinguish our own RNA from that of dangerous invaders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research led by Boston Children's Hospital and Stanford University researchers Ryan Flynn and Carolyn Bertozzi had noticed that our bodies add sugars onto RNA. These sugarcoated RNAs (also known as glycosylated RNAs, or glycoRNAs) are displayed on the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/cell+surface/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cell surface&lt;/a&gt; and don't seem to provoke the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rathinam and his colleagues wondered whether the sugar was somehow shielding the glycoRNAs from the immune system. This could be a strategy the body uses to prevent our own RNA from provoking inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;When Vincent Graziano, a Ph.D. student in Rathinam's lab and lead author on the paper, took glycoRNA from human cell cultures and blood, cut off the sugars, and reintroduced it into cells, the immune cells attacked it. The &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; had ignored the same RNA when it was sugarcoated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The sugarcoating hides our own RNA from the immune system," Rathinam says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is particularly significant to our body because cells are often covered by glycoRNAs. When cells die and are cleaned up by the immune system, the sugarcoating of RNA prevents dead cells from unnecessarily stimulating inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings could help when thinking about autoimmune diseases. Certain &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/autoimmune+diseases/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;autoimmune diseases&lt;/a&gt;, such as lupus, are associated with specific RNA and dead cells setting off the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that scientists understand the role of RNA glycosylation in deflecting immune system attention, they can check on whether that strategy is somehow going awry, and, if so, how it might be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

Research reveals that their brains either resist Alzheimer’s-related plaques and tangles or remain resilient despite having them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These individuals maintain a youthful brain structure, with a thicker cortex and unique neurons linked to memory and social skills. Insights from their biology and behavior could inspire new strategies to protect cognitive health into late life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptional Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; SuperAgers score like 50–60-year-olds on memory tests despite being 80+.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Structure:&lt;/strong&gt; They have thicker cortex regions and unique neurons linked to social and memory functions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Protection:&lt;/strong&gt; Resistance or resilience to Alzheimer’s pathology helps preserve function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For 25 years, scientists at Northwestern Medicine have been studying individuals aged 80 and older — dubbed “SuperAgers” — to better understand what makes them tick. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These unique individuals, who show outstanding memory performance at a level consistent with individuals who are at least three decades younger, challenge the long-held belief that cognitive decline is an inevitable part of aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112100"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne.jpg" alt="This shows an older woman and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/superagers-memory-neuroscicne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;SuperAgers score at least 9 out of 15 on a delayed word recall test — on par with individuals in their 50s and 60s. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the quarter-century of research, the scientists have seen some notable lifestyle and personality differences between SuperAgers and those aging typically — such as being social and gregarious — but “it’s really what we’ve found in their brains that’s been so earth-shattering for us,” said Dr. Sandra Weintraub, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By identifying biological and behavioral traits associated with SuperAging, the scientists hope to uncover new strategies to promote cognitive resilience and delay or prevent Alzheimer’s and other diseases that cause cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that exceptional memory in old age is not only possible but is linked to a distinct neurobiological profile. This opens the door to new interventions aimed at preserving brain health well into the later decades of life,” said Weintraub, corresponding author of a new paper summarizing the findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper will be published in a perspective piece in Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association as part of the journal’s special issue commemorating the 40th anniversary of the National Institute on Aging’s Alzheimer’s Disease Centers Program and the 25th anniversary of the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SuperAger brains are resilient, resistant &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “SuperAger” was coined by Dr. M. Marsel Mesulam, who founded the Mesulam Center for Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer’s Disease at Northwestern in the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, a cohort of 290 SuperAger participants has passed through the Mesulam Center’s doors, and the scientists have autopsied 77 donated SuperAger brains. Some of the brains contained amyloid and tau proteins (also known as plaques and tangles), which are known to play key roles in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, but others didn’t develop any. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we realized is there are two mechanisms that lead someone to become a SuperAger,” Weintraub said. “One is resistance: they don’t make the plaques and tangles. Two is resilience: they make them, but they don’t do anything to their brains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;key findings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptional memory performance:&lt;/strong&gt; SuperAgers score at least 9 out of 15 on a delayed word recall test — on par with individuals in their 50s and 60s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youthful brain structure:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike typically aging brains, SuperAgers show no significant thinning of their cortex — the outer layer of the brain — and even have a thicker anterior cingulate cortex than younger adults. This crucial region of the brain plays a significant role in integrating information related to decision-making, emotion and motivation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique cellular traits:&lt;/strong&gt; SuperAgers have more von economo neurons, which are specialized cells linked to social behavior, and larger entorhinal neurons, which are critical for memory, than their typically aging peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sociability as a common trait:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite having diverse lifestyles and varying approaches to exercise, SuperAgers tend to be highly social and report strong interpersonal relationships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain donation can offer scientific immortality’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Mesulam Center, SuperAgers are evaluated annually and may choose to donate their brains for post-mortem evaluation by Northwestern scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many of the findings from this paper stem from the examination of brain specimens of generous, dedicated SuperAgers who were followed for decades,” said co-author Dr. Tamar Gefen, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Feinberg, director of Feinberg’s Laboratory for Translational Neuropsychology and a neuropsychologist at the Mesulam Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am constantly amazed by how brain donation can enable discovery long after death, offering a kind of scientific immortality.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.brain.northwestern.edu/join/SuperAging.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Learn more about how to join the SuperAger research registry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perspective piece is titled, “The First 25 Years of the Northwestern SuperAging Program.” Other Northwestern authors include Dr. Mesulam and Changiz Geula, research professor of cell and developmental biology and neuroscience at Feinberg and a member of the Mesulam Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this aging and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#78130b19150d1d140b17163816170a0c100f1d0b0c1d0a16561d1c0d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kristin Samuelson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://northwestern.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kristin Samuelson – Northwestern University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The First 25 Years of the Northwestern SuperAging Program&lt;/a&gt;” by Sandra Weintraub et al. &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp;

they also have a region in the cingulate gyrus that is thicker than younger neurotypical adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to cellular biology, superagers have fewer Alzheimer’s disease–type changes in the brain, greater size of entorhinal neurons, fewer inflammatory microglia in white matter, better preserved cholinergic innervation, and a greater density of evolutionarily progressive von Economo neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, deeper characterization of the superaging phenotype may lead to interventions that enhance resistance and resilience to involutional changes considered part of average (i.e., “normal”) brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This line of work is helping to revise common misperceptions about the cognitive potential of senescence and has inspired investigations throughout the United States and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Local health officials are still investigating how a Pierce County woman who hadn’t traveled recently &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/malaria-possibly-contracted-in-wa-would-be-states-first-case/" class="content-link"&gt;might have contracted malaria&lt;/a&gt; — but however it happened, the situation involved an “unusual sequence of events.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is rare for a few reasons, said Dr. James Miller, health officer of the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department, which &lt;a href="https://tpchd.org/news/we-are-investigating-possible-locally-acquired-case-of-malaria/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;announced the news &lt;/a&gt;Wednesday. It’s Washington state’s first locally acquired case, meaning the woman was most likely bitten here by a malaria-infected mosquito, which would have gotten malaria after biting someone else with the disease, who had traveled recently and perhaps contracted malaria abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that were the case, it would be a “very unusual sequence of events” Miller said, “which is why we’re doing this more extensive investigation for this case than we would typically for a travel-acquired malaria case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mosquito-borne disease does not spread from person to person, nor does it spread between mosquitoes, so risk to the general public is low, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient is receiving treatment, Miller said, but declined to give more details about her condition. He noted it’s common for people with malaria to be hospitalized, as the disease can cause very serious infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chance of the malaria-infected mosquito biting another person in the county is “pretty low,” Miller reiterated. “But of course, malaria is a serious disease. That’s why we’re taking this seriously and doing a full investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation includes, in the meantime, a plan to work with the state Department of Health to set up mosquito traps all over the county and collect data from them. It’s unlikely they’ll find the malaria-infected mosquito that bit the Pierce County patient, Miller acknowledged, but the data is useful in gauging how many other mosquitoes might be carrying the malaria parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main purpose is really just to get a sense of … the burden for the population of Anopheles mosquitoes, which is the set of species that can transmit malaria,” Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the investigation also looks at other patients in Washington recently diagnosed with malaria, to see if there could be any potential connections, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, malaria cases are usually linked to travel, mainly from sub-Saharan African countries, and regions of South America and Southeast Asia, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Anopheles mosquitoes, which are in Pierce County and Washington, can transmit malaria across the U.S. if they bite someone infected with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. sees about 2,000 to 2,500 cases per year, and &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/public-health-provider-resources/notifiable-conditions/malaria" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;Washington sees 20 to 70 reports of malaria&lt;/a&gt; in travelers each year, according to the state Department of Health. In 2023, the U.S. saw its first locally acquired malaria case in 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten cases were reported across four states — &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7342a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;Florida, Texas, Maryland and Arkansas&lt;/a&gt; — from May to October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, 19 cases of travel-associated malaria have been reported in Washington state, according to DOH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Miller said, mosquito populations are starting to shrink in Pierce County and throughout the state at this point in the year. Mosquitoes like warm weather and being near water to breed, so they prefer early summer, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When temperatures fall, populations also decline, Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, people should try to take basic precautions to avoid getting bit, he said, including: wearing bug spray, removing standing water in yards and considering long pants or long sleeves if in a place there are mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if traveling to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/hcp/preparing-international-travelers/yellow-fever-vaccine-and-malaria-prevention-information-by-country.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;country where there’s risk of malaria&lt;/a&gt;, think about precautionary measures such as taking medication before, during and after your trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease typically causes fever, chills, body aches, headaches and fatigue. Without treatment, it &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/php/surveillance-report/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;can be fatal&lt;/a&gt;, Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people recognize these symptoms or suspect malaria, health officials recommend seeking early testing and treatment. The disease can be treated with antimalarial drugs. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I had chicken pox as a child and shingles as an adult. I have gotten the Shingrix vaccine. For an occasional cold sore, I use acyclovir, but I take L-lysine daily for prevention. Has anyone studied this as an alternative prevention against Alzheimer’s disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="62FT2YPZYVEHRC4PRRPGRQDXWE"&gt;As I understand it, the herpes virus might be a contributing factor. Since L-lysine is available without a prescription in the U.S., it could be an alternative to antiviral drugs for many people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HYX7NPUHSFHXPMOCDNSVHZZHSA"&gt;A. The link between herpes virus infection and AD is tantalizing, but it has not yet been firmly established. What we know about L-lysine is that it can help reduce outbreaks of cold sores due to herpes (Viruses, June 2, 2023). According to the scientists, the effective dose of this dietary supplement is at least 1 gram per day. We found no studies of L-lysine being used to prevent AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5EVWBTU5L5ACFHWUICHCFAIOQA"&gt;L-lysine is an essential amino acid. Another amino acid, arginine, counteracts the antiviral action of lysine. As a result, L-lysine appears to be more effective if people reduce their intake of arginine from sources such as legumes, nuts and meat like turkey, chicken or pork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RM2L4IZXVRE6DPNYFRZIXB76AI"&gt;It was smart of you to get vaccinated against shingles. The varicella zoster virus that causes both chicken pox and shingles has also been implicated in AD. Studies in Wales and Australia indicate that older people vaccinated against shingles are less likely to develop AD than their neighbors who were not vaccinated (Nature, April 2, 2025; JAMA, April 23, 2025). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM" data-fusion-component="FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM" data-fusion-component="FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AW27S6DSHFCL3LRTWJSJCAN7NU"&gt;Q. I have read that there is now an epinephrine nasal spray called neffy for severe allergic reactions or even anaphylaxis. It requires a prescription and is pricey. Why not use over-the-counter Primatene Mist instead? It’s far less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DEXAM7NQ3FFRXIKIYALXO7OUXI"&gt;A. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction. It must always be treated as a medical emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HWGBRUAKGFH6XLTVQMY3I7NX5Q"&gt;Epinephrine auto-injectors such as EpiPen or Adrenaclick deliver a specified dose of epinephrine immediately into the bloodstream. German scientists studied Primatene Mist to see if it could be used as a substitute treatment for anaphylaxis and found it is not suitable (Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft, May 2009). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JF7WMR57UVAULCBW4SMLVD74DY"&gt;On the other hand, neffy was developed specifically to immediately provide an appropriate dose of epinephrine. Experimenting with a money-saving alternative may not be wise when the outcome could be death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JV6MCHOH2VEWXPLJQLBNMTAT4M"&gt;&lt;i&gt;In their column, Joe and Teresa Graedon answer letters from readers.
