They are commonly used for pain relievers, multivitamins, stool softeners, and cough and cold medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it remains unknown how many Americans take such capsules, the US soft gel capsules market was valued at $2.14 billion in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A top heart doctor has revealed the insidious chemical in medicine capsules that could increase your risk of a heart attack &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told this website: 'Phthalates [can] increase inflammation and an important risk for heart disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2021 Environmental Pollution study found phthalate exposure was associated with a slightly higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Evan Levine, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai, New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists analyzed the urine samples of 5,300 adults between the ages of 55 to 64 years old from 2001 to 2010 and tracked causes of death among.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed among the 100,000 people who died during the study period, the ones with higher levels of phthalates in their urine were more likely to have died from heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists noted further research is needed to understand the exact ink between phthalate exposure and heart problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, according to Dr Levine, exposure to phthalates - especially through pills - can cause swelling and irritation in&lt;span&gt; the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, which can lead them to narrow or harden, potentially causing blockages or aneurysms - ballooning in the wall of a blood vessel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is usually caused by the buildup of cholesterol and other substances, forming plaques, along the artery walls, but excessive intake of phthalates can also lead to this inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Softgel capsule shells are made of phthalates - making it easier for manufacturers to mold the capsules into their own desired shape&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts claim the chemicals also cause oxidative stress, a type of cell and tissue damage caused by an imbalance of molecules in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to damage in the heart cells, which can impair their function and contribute to inflammation, as well harden artery walls - increasing the risk for a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, phthalates can negatively impact cholesterol levels and potentially increase levels of triglycerides - a type of fat known to cause heart attacks - and low-density lipoproteins in the organ - making a person more susceptible to strokes and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Small change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers identified the EspW mutation by comparing the genetic sequences of 729 isolates of the new &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; strain—dubbed REPEXH01—to genetic sequences of 2,027 other &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; O157:H7 isolates. Of the 729 REPEXH01 strains, all but two had a single nucleotide deletion in EspW (the remaining two had ambiguous sequences), while the deletion was present in less than 4 percent of the non-REPEXH01 &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; strains. The finding suggests the tiny change could be a genetic signature of the strain, and its persistence in a key disease protein may offer the strain an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, it's unclear what that advantage might be. The deletion of a single DNA base (an adenine) shifts the frame of the three-sequence protein code for the rest of EspW. This could result in a shorter protein. It could also cause the molecular machinery that translates the genetic code to slip, leading to proteins of various lengths. In any case, the deletion is likely to result in a less fully functional EspW protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers suggest this could help &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;when it's on lettuce and other produce. For example, EspW might spur an immune response from an infected plant that causes stomata—pores on the surfaces of leaves—to close, blocking the bacteria's ability to invade. Thus, cutting back EspW may help &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;sneak in—an adaptation in the ongoing arms race between the bacteria and its host. Another possibility is that EspW could function like HopW1, leading to more severe infection in plant tissues, which could lower the chances that those infected leaves are harvested and make it to grocery stores and atop burgers. Thus, cutting back on EspW could help &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; move to its human victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, additional research will be needed to understand what's going on. As the CDC researchers conclude: "the role of the single base pair mutation in this strain’s colonization and survival on leafy vegetables could yield valuable insights."&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;a class="read-more-main-single read-more-main" href="https://collive.com/measles-case-confirmed-in-williamsburg/"&gt;Full Story&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="post_text"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By COLlive reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A confirmed case of measles has been reported in the Williamsburg neighborhood, raising serious concern among local health professionals about the potential for a broader outbreak, particularly within the frum community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can lead to severe health complications, especially in young children. With dense populations and close-knit social networks, the risk of rapid spread in the community is significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nobody wants their child to get measles,” warned local Crown Heights physician Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Eli Rosen&lt;/strong&gt; of the Crown Heights ODA, in a message to patients. Dr. Rosen stressed that if your child is unvaccinated or missing a booster, to schedule an appointment to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is proven to be both safe and effective. Two doses—typically administered at ages 1 and 4—offer up to 97% protection against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This development comes as health officials continue to emphasize the importance of proactive prevention measures to avoid a repeat of past outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Feeling persistently exhausted or being in a constant state of low energy may be due to a mini-stroke you had without realizing, a study suggests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, some have reported continued challenges including reduced quality of life, thinking problems, depression, anxiety and fatigue.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study followed 354 people with an average age of 70 who had a mini-stroke for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were asked to complete questionnaires about their level of fatigue in the first two weeks after a mini-stroke and again at three, six and 12 months later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers looked at how many participants experienced fatigue by defining it as a score of 12 or higher. Those being analyzed also underwent had brain scans to check for blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts discovered that 61 percent of those surveyed experienced increases in their fatigue scores two weeks after the mini-stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half reported fatigue at the three, six and 12 month mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists also found that participants who reported feeling fatigued were twice as likely to have a history of anxiety and/or depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team said that the study was observational and cannot prove that the mini-strokes were behind the persistent fatigue.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Modrau said: 'Long-term fatigue was common in our group of study participants, and we found if people experience fatigue within two weeks after leaving the hospital, it is likely they will continue to have fatigue for up to a year.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also advised that experts need to focus on whether mini-stroke patients are showing signs of fatigue and provide adequate care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For future studies, people diagnosed with a transient ischemic attack should be followed in the weeks and months that follow to be assessed for lingering fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This could help us better understand who might struggle with fatigue long-term and require further care,' he concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study has been published today in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While not as extensively as a complete stroke, a mini stroke can cause a certain degree of brain damage when it occurs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This damage can leave a person with muscle weakness, difficulty with coordination and a general sense of weariness - which are all signs of fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fatigue is medically described as the persistent and excessive feeling of tiredness or lack of energy which interferes with daily activities, even after adequate rest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Particularly, physical fatigue can include muscle weakness, aches, pain, gastrointestinal issues and headaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While mental fatigue entails difficulty concentrating, learning new tasks, slowed reflexes and impaired decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain damage due to a mini-stroke can also change sleeping patterns, emotional distress and memory, all of which can contribute to ongoing tiredness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That estimate accounts for gases released when companies drill for oil and gas, transport it to refineries, turn it into plastic and mold it into products.

Later, they die and sink — or they get eaten and pooped out by other sea creatures — falling to the bottom of the ocean in a constant flurry of organic material called “marine snow.” When marine snow settles to the bottom of the sea, it &lt;a href="https://www.whoi.edu/know-your-ocean/ocean-topics/how-the-ocean-works/cycles/biological-carbon-pump-ocean-topic/"&gt;locks away carbon&lt;/a&gt; for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="G4NHDVJVXT0VF20PAE7VNUTMYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But plastic can &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2478475-microplastics-could-be-hampering-the-oceans-ability-to-capture-carbon/"&gt;gum up the works&lt;/a&gt; by slowing plankton’s growth, making the little critters more buoyant so they don’t sink, or breaking up fish poop in a way that makes it less likely to settle at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2YEWZBNRD92GV9P15KP1XGBWAG" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s been shown that plastics can mess up the fecal pellets of these animals that are crucial for sequestering carbon in the ocean,” said Tracy Mincer, an associate professor at Florida Atlantic University who published a paper showing that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08818-1"&gt;5 percent of marine snow&lt;/a&gt; in the deep sea is now made of plastic. “But as far as how much … we’re still trying to figure it out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DMCPBQKH6H333FU138JAHN5F8C" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the soil, plastic changes the way microbes store and release carbon, which could also warm the planet, although Kaufman said there’s not enough research yet to say how much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="A5QHQB76VN47D0YUPP6XWGNR3R" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="A5QHQB76VN47D0YUPP6XWGNR3R" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How plastics may affect the Earth’s reflectivity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XC4BVFCKKH1D74RUA4GQKD71YM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Normally, light-colored and reflective surfaces such as snow, ice and clouds reflect the sun’s energy back into space, keeping the Earth from warming up too much.

Once known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, it can lead to metabolic dysregulation, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and fibrosis, or scarring, of the liver. This advanced stage of the condition is called metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22988-nonalcoholic-steatohepatitis" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22988-nonalcoholic-steatohepatitis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MASH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the condition's prevalence, only one drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat MASH, and it doesn't work well for everyone. So now, in a new study, scientists are exploring the effects of a fungus called &lt;em&gt;Fusarium foetens &lt;/em&gt;and their therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The unique effects of &lt;em&gt;F. foetens&lt;/em&gt; are truly miraculous," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://physiology.bjmu.edu.cn/HomePage/Staffs/Professors/b34569e2892b4cc98dfc4f3ca25c4e7a.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://physiology.bjmu.edu.cn/HomePage/Staffs/Professors/b34569e2892b4cc98dfc4f3ca25c4e7a.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Changtao Jiang&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a distinguished professor and deputy dean in the School of Basic Medical Sciences at Peking University in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.

However, little was known about the specific microorganisms and molecules involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-QcFVnHxQbwh7ThjYVNL4tf" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-QcFVnHxQbwh7ThjYVNL4tf slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, although gut bacteria have been studied more deeply, little is known about gut fungi. That's partly because gut fungi have diverse and complex nutritional needs, making them hard to grow in the lab, and samples are easily contaminated because the fungal spores are airborne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gut fungi are often termed the 'dark matter' of the intestinal microecosystem," Jiang told Live Science by email. But in their latest work, the researchers not only identified how &lt;em&gt;F. foetens &lt;/em&gt;affects MASH&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;but also pinpointed the molecules and metabolites involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify the fungus, the researchers collected fecal samples from 100 people across five regions of China. They used a special system to grow the fungi within each sample in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system aims to mimic a real gut "as much as possible," Jiang said. It involves immersing small chips in fecal extract. Each chip contains chambers filled with a Jell-O-like substance infused with extracts from the fecal samples. Each chamber is capped with a membrane designed to allow nutrients from poo into the diffusion chamber without letting microbes escape through the same pores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system was a "clever cultivation" technique for isolating different species of fungus, according to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/lewis-kim/" target="_blank" data-url="https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/lewis-kim/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kim Lewis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of biology at Northeastern University who specializes in microbiome therapeutics and was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to analyzing samples from China, the team studied published data from other studies of intestinal fungi that used volunteers in eight other countries. This enabled them to identify the most common fungal strains found in the gut, not only in China but worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering data from around the world helped ensure the samples covered a broad range of diets and environmental exposures, as both factors shape the gut microbiome. "Urban residents typically exhibit lower gut microbiota diversity compared to rural residents," Jiang noted, "likely due to reduced contact with natural environments and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/colon-cancer-antibiotic-use-link.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/colon-cancer-antibiotic-use-link.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;increased antibiotic use&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because fungi spread through the air, the researchers compared fungal communities grown from air and from intestinal samples to spot those likely to be contaminants. The team also tested how well the fungal strains withstood the temperature of the gut — around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius) — and the lack of oxygen found in the intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through these experiments, the researchers found that across all of the fecal samples,&lt;em&gt; F. foetens&lt;/em&gt; stood out as the most common strain that was likely to thrive in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/astronauts-to-grow-livers-in-space-where-microgravity-might-help-them-thrive" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/astronauts-to-grow-livers-in-space-where-microgravity-might-help-them-thrive"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astronauts to grow livers in space, where microgravity might help them thrive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see whether &lt;em&gt;F. foetens &lt;/em&gt;could influence fatty liver disease, the researchers administered the fungus to mice for two weeks. The rodents had been fed a high-fat diet designed to trigger MASH symptoms. Although the weight of the treated mice was comparable to that of the mice not given the fungus, the weight of their livers was less. The treated mice also had less liver inflammation and fibrosis and lower levels of chemicals associated with MASH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking closer, Jiang and his colleagues found that the &lt;em&gt;F. foetens &lt;/em&gt;treatment reduced the activity of a key enzyme for making certain types of fats. As the activity of this enzyme — called ceramide synthase (CerS) — fell, so did the levels of those fats. The researchers confirmed these effects through additional experiments on mice that had been genetically altered to either decrease or increase their CerS production, as well as on mice fed ceramide supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work "holds significant implications for developing clinical therapeutic strategies targeting gut fungi," Jiang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis agreed, adding that the "unexpected discovery" raises the idea that scientists could isolate gut microbes that "we never knew existed to fight human diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers plan to study the effects of &lt;em&gt;F. foetens &lt;/em&gt;in humans. They also want to investigate the molecular pathways involved in the therapeutic effect and the roles other intestinal fungi might play in metabolic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-QcFVnHxQbwh7ThjYVNL4tf-e657M9H54oC2oHcgQGaChFhgTiR7lMb4" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-QcFVnHxQbwh7ThjYVNL4tf-e657M9H54oC2oHcgQGaChFhgTiR7lMb4 slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study, presented at the European Congress on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt;, found that even for those taking newer, higher-dose weight loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, people put weight back on once they stopped treatment. While those taking semaglutide (Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro) lost double the amount of weight compared with people using older jabs – 16kg on average – patients put on 9.6kg within a year, meaning they could expect to regain all 16kg again in just over 20 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers studied 6,370 adults in eight randomised controlled trials and three observational studies. Of these, 1,465 patients were taking semaglutide and tirzepatide – higher-dose jabs recommended specifically for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36239137/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Previous analysis&lt;/a&gt; of trials into the efficacy of different diets, not including drugs, by the same researchers, found that while people also regained weight after stopping diets, the rate of regain was much slower, taking at least five years to get back to the weight they were before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“These drugs are very effective at helping you lose weight, but when you stop them, weight regain is much faster than [after stopping] diets,” said Susan Jebb, the co-author of the study and professor of diet and population health at University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings raise issues for the NHS, as &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta875/resources/semaglutide-for-managing-overweight-and-obesity-pdf-82613674831813" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nice guidelines&lt;/a&gt; state people should not be on weight loss injections for more than two years. Additionally, many patients give up the treatment, whether because they are buying it privately so cannot afford it, because the side-effects do not suit them or because they are not losing weight any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Is it going to be worth the NHS investing in these drugs if they only have them for a short time and then they pile all the weight back on, or does the NHS have to accept that these are going to be long-term therapies?” Jebb added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Either people really have to accept this as a treatment for life,, or we in science need to think really, really hard, how to support people when they stop the drug​.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the study did not show causality, Jebb speculated that the difference in how fast people put weight back on could be due to the fact that diets are hard and people have to practise restraint to lose weight, whereas if you are taking a drug that knocks your hunger out completely, you don’t have to​ make that effort. “So when the drugs are then taken away, you haven’t got those sort of behavioural strategies in place that help keep the weight off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Responding to the findings, Tam Fry, the chair of the National Obesity Forum, said: “It shouldn’t surprise anyone if people regain weight having used GLP-1 drugs without seriously attempting to improve their lifestyle … Using GLP-1 is not the quick fix which many users believe it to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Jane Ogden, a professor of health psychology at Surrey University, said there was no point “just throwing people back out into the world of their own lives, carrying on their own behaviours from before” after coming off the injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“They’re going to need psychological counselling, behaviour change, nutritional support from that moment on to help them sustain healthier behaviour in the long term, to keep the weight off,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The NHS should introduce a stepped care approach through online support available to large numbers of people at low cost, online or in-person group support or more intensive 1:1 support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Jason Halford, at the European Association for the Study of Obesity, said: “We need to ensure patients have the support to make the changes in their behaviour they need to sustain the benefits of treatment. [Weight loss jabs] are an adjunct to behavioural change, not a replacement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxQSWhaczNKTG80T05tWDIxbG54YzZ6dWFnMFZidHVTX0JMbU95SktkY0R6OVI0QTd6dk1UN09mQjFkTjYtbmVzZy1LZlBLSFYtQ3F1aEF5UFBNdlNleVlPcjB1ZUh3UWpwdlpoVjQ5VW44eFkwUkFCa3ZNYjhlazBuX0pGUEUzNmZaNGRNdGZVMlYzdXNadGtWZFBBRkdueHhpYWhQdHUyMXVZdl9XT2lVcEJkRlRsdDZDS1JpS1I1VGxkYjZoTUJaZWR3ZExwRms</guid></item><item><title>健康专家揭示了饭后应该做的一件事--《独立报》 | Health expert reveals the one thing you should do after meals - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOamR3NWlxY2luZ0pHUi1sMVNsS3VSS21ZM3pWcFZCa0xvem5MT1pVU1otbDl4Nk5kbmEyMG51RWp3LUU4cmpraHRzcUxUNHdXWXNoSk03QUQ5Zm00czE4WE10c21tZW1yWWJ5S19CbjJQbjRjYjhZblZYN2xUc29XUEtIenN6eURJdVEzbEItU2VUY29BUEVyTHkxVzAtT0Zt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-1d79dbf-0 bMBiKL"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sc-erjdy9-0 kGIjiJ"&gt;Thank you for registering&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1ty8yds-2 cZXkPo"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1ty8yds-0 ekobrD"&gt;Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1ty8yds-1 ebpzYi"&gt;Please refresh your browser to be logged in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 18:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxOamR3NWlxY2luZ0pHUi1sMVNsS3VSS21ZM3pWcFZCa0xvem5MT1pVU1otbDl4Nk5kbmEyMG51RWp3LUU4cmpraHRzcUxUNHdXWXNoSk03QUQ5Zm00czE4WE10c21tZW1yWWJ5S19CbjJQbjRjYjhZblZYN2xUc29XUEtIenN6eURJdVEzbEItU2VUY29BUEVyTHkxVzAtT0Zt</guid></item><item><title>宠物猫的禽流感正在上升。业主需要了解的信息-全球新闻 | Bird flu in pet cats is on the rise.

					&lt;p&gt;As a deadly &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/bird-flu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; outbreak sweeps through wild and domestic bird populations globally, researchers have identified an alarming trend that could bring the virus closer to humans: a significant increase in infections among pet &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/cats" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cats&lt;/a&gt; and other feline species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://d21y75miwcfqoq.cloudfront.net/70c8fc80" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While avian influenza — commonly known as bird flu — has long been a concern for poultry and wild bird populations, infections in mammals, especially pets like cats, have historically been rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that appears to be changing fast, new research warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review, published May 7 in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofaf261/8123920" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Open Forum Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;, found a surge in bird flu virus infections among cats worldwide — both indoor and outdoor — particularly linked to the emergent &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/10614208/bird-flu-strains-world-what-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;H5N1 strain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trend, experts warn, could signal an increased risk of the virus jumping from animals to humans.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;The review, conducted by researchers at the University of Maryland, analyzed 20 years of scientific data on bird flu in felines, from 2004 to 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It documented more than 600 cases across 18 countries, with more than 300 fatalities. Researchers found a sharp rise in domestic cat infections over the last few years, specifically in 2023 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more cats that get infected with H5N1, the more it creates a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of the virus to and from humans, the review warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We estimate that this phenomenon is underreported in the scientific literature and argue that increased surveillance among domestic cats is urgently needed,” the researchers stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="l-article__part" data-shortcode="tp_video"&gt;			    	&lt;div class="c-video c-videoPlay " data-iframe-receiver data-autoplay="" data-displayinline-featured="false" data-displayinline-type="video" data-displayinline-player-id="miniplayer_10934726_68256e27c4c16" data-displayinline-video-id="10934726" data-displayinline-ratio="16:9" data-displayinline="https://globalnews.ca/video/embed/10934726/#autoplay&amp;amp;stickyiframe=miniplayer_10934726_68256e27c4c16" data-displayinline-sticky="true"&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 126 cats have tested positive for the virus since 2022, with about half of those cases occurring in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;					&lt;div class="c-inlineSignup" data-newsletter-inline&gt;

				&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Many of the infected cats were exposed through contaminated food or raw milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in November 2024, &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/10955478/pet-cats-die-drinking-raw-milk-bird-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;two pet cats in California died&lt;/a&gt; after drinking raw milk that had been contaminated with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;div class="c-tabs"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Canada has not officially reported any bird flu infections in cats, that doesn’t mean they haven’t occurred, said Shayan Sharif, a professor and associate dean with the Ontario Veterinary College at the University of Guelph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been at least one confirmed fatal case of &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/9602040/avian-flu-dog-death-canada-oshawa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;avian influenza in a dog in Oshawa, Ont.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada has also documented bird flu infections in other domestic animals and wild mammals, fuelling concerns about the virus’s ability to spread across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“H5N1 is already known to infect cats, domestic cats, and also other feline species like tigers, mountain cats … either kept in captivity or the wild,” Sharif said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we didn’t actually know was how susceptible cats can be to H5N1, specifically this particular new clade (2.3.4.4b). It’s become quite apparent that domestic cats are, in fact, susceptible to H5N1.”&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

				How are cats getting bird flu?			&lt;/h2&gt;
						&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;	
	&lt;p&gt;Given how closely cats live with humans, the researchers wanted to find out how widespread bird flu infections might be in feline populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review showed that nearly two-thirds of all known feline infections were in domestic cats, and of those, 71 per cent didn’t survive. The main culprit is the newer H5N1 strain (clade 2.3.4.4b), which first showed up in cats in 2022 and has spread rapidly since.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/p&gt;

					
		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;It also pinpointed several ways cats are getting exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most caught the virus by eating infected birds or raw meat. But some cats get sick after drinking raw milk from infected dairy cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the reported infections in felines in the review were confirmed or suspected to be a result of eating dead pigeons, chickens and other birds, as well as contaminated raw chicken feed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just outdoor cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, cases of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b recently reported by the Colorado Health Department included two indoor-only domestic cats with no known exposure to infected animals,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This observation raises concerns regarding new and unknown transmission routes of (avian influenza) to domestic cats.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="l-article__part" data-shortcode="section-heading"&gt;	&lt;p class="l-article__sectionHeading c-sectionHeading "&gt;

				What is the risk to humans?			&lt;/h2&gt;
						&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although very rare, cat-to-human transmission of the virus has been reported, the review stated.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;For example, in 2016, &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/spotlights/avian-influenza-cats.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an outbreak of avian influenza&lt;/a&gt; happened among cats in New York City animal shelters and more than 100 cats were infected. A veterinarian who had close, prolonged, unprotected exposure to the respiratory secretions of infected cats contracted the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharif said the risk of transmission from cats to humans remains very low, but added it’s still important to stay vigilant during this outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In case of avian influence, unfortunately, it can be quite lethal in cats,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are neurologic signs, such as tremors and seizures. There have also been indications that they can go blind, unfortunately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you suspect your cat is showing symptoms, he recommends contacting your local vet immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the researchers of the review are calling on wider surveillance among domestic canines to determine how widespread the virus is, “in order to appropriately assess the risk of spillover to humans and other animals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="l-article__part" data-shortcode="tp_video"&gt;			    	&lt;div class="c-video c-videoPlay " data-iframe-receiver data-autoplay="" data-displayinline-featured="false" data-displayinline-type="video" data-displayinline-player-id="miniplayer_11072328_68256e27cb515" data-displayinline-video-id="11072328" data-displayinline-ratio="16:9" data-displayinline="https://globalnews.ca/video/embed/11072328/#autoplay&amp;amp;stickyiframe=miniplayer_11072328_68256e27cb515" data-displayinline-sticky="true"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s according to early data from &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06344026"&gt;the Phase 1/2a ASPIRO (NCT06344026) study&lt;/a&gt;, an open-label clinical trial testing the safety and tolerability of ANPD001 over one year when injected at either of two doses in adults with moderate to advanced Parkinson’s. Researchers are also tracking changes in on time, or periods when motor symptoms are adequately controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this first-of-its-kind study, we are seeing clinician-reported and patient-reported improvements as well as a strong safety and tolerability profile at six months,” Edward Wirth III, MD, PhD, chief medical officer at developer &lt;a href="https://aspenneuroscience.com/"&gt;Aspen Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aspen-neuroscience-announces-6-month-aspiro-phase-12a-clinical-trial-results-of-personalized-cell-therapy-for-parkinsons-disease-302448009.html"&gt;company press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data were presented in a poster at the 30th World Congress on Parkinson’s Disease and Related Disorders, held May 7–10 in New York. An abstract for the poster, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prd-journal.com/article/S1353-8020(25)00371-2/fulltext"&gt;Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of intracranial delivery of autologous iPSC-derived dopaminergic precursors in moderate to advanced Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Parkinsonism &amp;amp; Related Disorders&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/"&gt;Parkinson’s symptoms&lt;/a&gt; result from the loss of dopaminergic neurons, the nerve cells that produce dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is involved in motor control, and low levels of dopamine lead to slowed or stiff movements, tremors, and problems with balance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Replacing lost neurons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aspenneuroscience.com/technology/pipeline/"&gt;ANPD001&lt;/a&gt; is designed to replace the dopaminergic neurons that are gradually lost in Parkinson’s. As an autologous therapy, it uses a patient’s own cells, eliminating the need for immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection by the immune system. The process begins by collecting skin cells from the patient, which are then reprogrammed in the lab into induced pluripotent stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These stem cells are guided to develop into precursors of dopaminergic neurons and returned to the patient by &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/precision-mri-system-part-parkinsons-stem-cell-therapy-trial/"&gt;MRI-guided injection&lt;/a&gt; into a brain region called the putamen, where they’re expected to develop into functional dopaminergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ASPIRO study involves patients ages 50–70 who respond to &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-treatments/#Levodopa"&gt;levodopa&lt;/a&gt;, a mainstay Parkinson’s treatment that provides the body with a molecule it can use to produce dopamine, but still have uncontrolled motor symptoms. Its main goal is to test ANPD001’s safety over one year, with patients continuing to be monitored for up to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the study’s &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/1st-patient-treated-trial-parkinsons-cell-therapy-anpd001/"&gt;launch last year&lt;/a&gt;, ANPD001 has been found safe and well tolerated, with no serious side effects. All patients in the &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/cell-therapy-anpd001-safe-first-2-parkinsons-patients-groups-trial/"&gt;first two groups&lt;/a&gt; who received the investigational cell therapy were sent home within 48 hours as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recently presented data showed that the three patients who received a low dose of ANPD001 — 5 million precursors of dopaminergic neurons each, delivered in a surgical procedure under general anesthesia — experienced no bleeding or graft-induced dyskinesia (uncontrolled movements caused by the cell therapy). The most common side effects were pain at the surgical site and tongue swelling from lying face down during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At six months, patients experienced a 45% improvement in MDS Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III scores, a measure of motor symptom severity, when they were off medication. They also reported a 71% improvement in MDS UPDRS Part II scores, which measures their ability to perform everyday activities such as eating, dressing, and walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, patients had two fewer hours each day of off time, periods when motor symptoms aren’t adequately controlled despite treatment with levodopa, and 1.5 more hours each day of good on time, when motor symptoms are adequately controlled without troublesome side effects, such as involuntary movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANPD001 has received &lt;a href="https://aspenneuroscience.com/fda-grants-fast-track-designation-to-anpd001-autologous-investigational-cell-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;fast track designation&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which may help accelerate its development and regulatory review. Benefits of this status include frequent guidance, expedited approval processes, and eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a common cause of hospital infections, causing &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/25164-pseudomonas-infection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis, among other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacterium is also pretty tough. Some types are resistant to nearly all antibiotics (known as multidrug-resistant, or MDR &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pseudomonas-aeruginosa/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), hence it is often dubbed a "&lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/what-is-a-superbug-77773" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;superbug&lt;/a&gt;". In the US, this strain is known to cause thousands of deaths in hospitalized patients each year, as well as tens of thousands of non-lethal infections. Those with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to such infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a troublesome organism, but now researchers have found that it is capable of breaking down plastics commonly used in hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carried out in the United Kingdom, this research identified an enzyme, named Pap1, that was produced by &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; taken from a wound. This enzyme can break down biodegradable plastic called polycaprolactone (PCL), which is used in various medical packages and devices, such as sutures, catheters, ventilators, implants, and plastic packaging for medical tools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, multiple bacteria have been found to produce enzymes that degrade plastic, but they have all been isolated from the environment. This is the first time one has been identified in a clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an important development, as it could explain why these bacteria are so persistent in hospitals. If they’re able to degrade plastic, then they may be able to contaminate surfaces and tools that are otherwise thought to be sterile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to identify this enzyme, the researchers took the gene that codes for the enzyme and transplanted it into &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;scherichia coli &lt;/em&gt;bacteria. When &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; expressed this enzyme, the team found that it started to break down the PCL on agar plates or beads. The same was true for the &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa &lt;/em&gt;isolated from the wound. Finally, the team produced a &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa &lt;/em&gt;bacterium that had the gene encoding Pap1 removed from it; they found that this version was not capable of degrading plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This poses several clinical challenges with respect to infection. PCL is widely used in medical care and is one of the materials at the forefront of biotechnological innovation due to its favorable biocompatibility profile," the team explains in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From a host perspective, the capacity for a pathogen to be able to compromise the structural integrity of any medical device or implant that contains PCL is likely to cause the failure of the medical intervention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible that this ability to degrade plastic helps the bacteria survive. If they can create small pits or impressions in the plastic, they have a chance to use them as niches that shield the bacteria from the immune system, disinfectants, or antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also found that the enzyme increases the amount of biofilm the bacteria can produce when compared to a different surface, such as glass. Generally speaking, if bacteria produce higher amounts of biofilm, they are more likely to be &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/antibiotic-resistance-how-were-trying-to-win-the-microscopic-arms-race-76106" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;resistant to antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Biofilms are the dominant mode of growth for bacteria, and adopting this mode of growth can make pathogens particularly recalcitrant to treatment," the team explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to test whether the ability of these bacteria to form biofilms would make them more virulent, the team also implanted them into greater wax moth (&lt;em&gt;Galleria mellonella&lt;/em&gt;) larvae. They found that changing the presence of the enzyme-producing gene in the &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; implant impacted the larvae’s survivability; bacteria that lacked the PCL implant were less harmful than those that had it present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the results demonstrate the risks &lt;em&gt;P. aeruginosa &lt;/em&gt;poses in medical settings, as it can increase &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tiny-robots-entirely-clear-pneumonia-infection-in-mice-in-just-3-days-65528" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;infection&lt;/a&gt; rates and also degrade medical plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As it can be degraded by the causative agent of an infection, the potential for increased infection risk and even accelerated degradation of implants or sutures should be considered in device design and treatment planning," they note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Antimicrobial components could be added to PCL medical devices to reduce the risk of infection and biodegradation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is now developing tests to check whether other pathogens can produce plastic-degrading enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00421-8" target="_blank"&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 17:31:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxPNnFzNHNLSWVQeGxUR3NUUEZQMXQ0NFhySXoxakhZV0h3WEwxUFVQM0NTa2lKV1piYm5zb1E5czRramV5S3NJeUVFUmJCU3EwWUlMMUp1UnlldUpYSDhJNzZaSzk1VFJ4RVNpQm55ZjcwTnczT3k1VEh0RVFneWVzSDNnaDUyZEI3aEM4Ukw1YjBBd3ZWMS0yRzYzNGNWaXMtQktMbkFlaG9VckxGM2pRR1ZwQQ</guid></item><item><title>FDA警告说，老年人在出现致命并发症后应跳过这种疫苗- AL.com | Seniors should skip this vaccine after deadly complications, FDA warns - AL.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SZLIDROXHNH3PFEPY2H6SBI2RI"&gt;Federal health officials are warning seniors to skip a vaccine often given to travelers to prevent a dangerous mosquito-borne illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JHFKB2VSHBH45BNTTV26JWMMMI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/medical-product-safety-information/fda-and-cdc-recommend-pause-use-ixchiq-chikungunya-vaccine-live-individuals-60-years-age-and-older" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.fda.gov/safety/medical-product-safety-information/fda-and-cdc-recommend-pause-use-ixchiq-chikungunya-vaccine-live-individuals-60-years-age-and-older"&gt;In a health alert, &lt;/a&gt;the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said people 60 years of age and older should skip getting Valneva-developed Ixchiq vaccine used to protect against chikungunya, a tropical disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="K5S6ILSWJNF3ZHLRE33UXJQF6E"&gt;Outbreaks of chikungunya linked to mosquitoes have been reported in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe and islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and can be spread to unaffected areas by infected travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="43UMF7MQ2VA5XJJI4A7CBNWWII"&gt;People can become infected with the chikungunya virus when mosquitoes feed on another infected person and then bite them.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2tace001o3b76yshdr4kj@published"&gt;My boyfriend “Kevin” and I have been together for a year and a half, and he’s everything I could want in a life partner. His sister spilled the beans to me that he’s been looking at engagement rings, so I expect him to propose soon. However, there’s one thing that gives me reservations.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2tadr001p3b76h0d9438c@published"&gt;When Kevin was in college, he … got around quite a bit. He had more than 300 encounters. The fact that he was with all these other women before he and I met doesn’t bother me. It’s the (what I think could be very real) possibility that we will get married only to have some woman show up demanding child support, or down the line, having to deal with a previously unknown son or daughter tracking him down. Given Kevin’s history, are my concerns valid, and should they give me pause when it comes to accepting a proposal from him?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="137" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2taiy001s3b76ytsbl06p@published"&gt;Hypothetically, surprise children are always a risk with any man who hasn’t been celibate until marriage. The fact that Kevin engaged in hundreds of sexual encounters during college absolutely does heighten your awareness of that possibility. One really useful, yet missing, crucial piece of information would be whether he consistently used condoms (and other forms of birth control) during these encounters. Sure, they aren’t 100 percent effective, but they do drastically reduce pregnancy. It’s also worth taking into account whether he checked in with partners after any encounter where the condom may have broken or slipped. Basically, if he was having sex with half of his female classmates with no birth control in place, that’s one thing. But if he was taking precautions, it’s less likely that he has a child somewhere that he doesn’t know about.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="152" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2takg001t3b76izepe4ry@published"&gt;That said, a decision to marry someone should take into account your feelings—all of them, including your worries. This concern &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; already giving you pause, and it’s worth doing some introspection around where that’s coming from. What’s behind your aversion to this possibility? Is whatever you find off-putting or worrisome about it also showing up in more subtle ways in your relationship? For instance, do you get the sense that Kevin was irresponsible during his college years, which is maybe reduced but still apparent now? Or do you have pretty rigid ideas about what structures families should have, and, if so, are you prepared for other unforeseen outcomes such as divorce, or untimely death? Are you strongly against having children in your life at all? And, in the event someone comes looking for Kevin later, would you be open to him having a relationship with them while you stay out of it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2tam1001u3b76209obse8@published"&gt;I think it’s also really important to consider whether you can share this concern with him and discuss how you might navigate such a situation. If your immediate reaction is, “No, I can’t open up to him about this,” &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; the reason to reject the proposal. But if, when presented with an appropriate opening, the two of you can talk through your worries, you might find yourself more comfortable with proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmao2m3eg005ff0kxdn8o2q90@published"&gt;I am a recently divorced woman with two daughters. I have been working hard to have a fit body, so I was eager to try out my cute new bikini when I took my daughters to the pool. The problem (at least for some people) is that I am blessed with what is apparently called a “happy trail”: a thin line of dark hair going from my belly button to my bikini line. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/08/happy-trail-grooming-advice.html"&gt;In the past, I have shaved it, but this time I figured I should hold onto this minor vestige of bodily autonomy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But consuming extra amounts could make blood cancer more aggressive, the team of experts hailing from the University of Rochester warn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since taurine is a common ingredient in energy drinks... our work suggests that it may be of interest to carefully consider the [risks and] benefits of supplemental taurine in leukemia patients,' the study says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also said while the research is still early, they are &lt;span&gt;'very excited' because targeting taurine production from leukemia cells 'may be a possible avenue for treatment of these aggressive diseases.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an experiment on mice and human leukemia cells, the researchers found stopping taurine from entering cells could slow the progression of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09018-7"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, comes as additional research works to understand &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13493163/red-bull-colon-cancer-crisis-young-people.html"&gt;if taurine could fuel other forms of cancer&lt;/a&gt; like colorectal cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in New York found taurine, an ingredient in energy drinks, could fuel the growth of leukemia cells (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taurine is an non-essential amino acid found naturally in the bone marrow, brain, heart and muscles. It's also found in meat and fish and is used in certain beverages to energize cells and boost mental clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought to help regulate the amount of calcium in nerve cells and control inflammation, among other things. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study looked at mice with a SLC6A6 gene, which transports taurine from different areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also took samples of human leukemia cells and transplanted them into the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team discovered taurine is produced by a subset of healthy cells in bone marrow, where leukemia grows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The SLC6A6 gene then transports taurine from the bone marrow to leukemia cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believe this is the first time taurine has been found in bone marrow, worsening leukemia - a blood cancer that strikes 67,000 Americans and 10,000 people in the UK every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 23,000 Americans and 5,000 Brits are expected to die of the disease this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, as leukemia cells feed on taurine, they go through glycolysis, a process in which cells break down the sugar glucose to produce energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Glycolysis gives cancer cells the energy to divide and multiply, making leukemia more aggressive, causing more cancer cells to form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Jeevisha Bajaj, lead researcher from the Wilmot Cancer Institute at the University of Rochester, said in a press release that further studies should investigate levels of taurine in leukemia patients and look at how to lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is especially crucial because taurine supplements are often recommended to cancer patients, as it may lower inflammation and reduce side effects from chemotherapy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our current data suggest that it would be helpful to develop stable and effective ways to block taurine from entering leukemia cells,' Dr. Bajaj said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taurine is considered safe in small amounts, but higher levels have been shown to cause vomiting, upset stomach, dizziness, diarrhea and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's still unclear the exact role taurine plays in other forms of cancer, though researchers have suspected it could be linked to the alarming rise of colon cancer in young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) shows rates of leukemia have remained steady, though deaths are decreasing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a phase two trial, a team at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/florida/index.html" id="mol-c02e1e20-30bf-11f0-b1d2-353395a3f03f"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; is recruiting adults ages 18 to 40 who have not been diagnosed with colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half of the group is meant to consume at least one Red Bull or Celsius drink every day, and researchers will compare their gut bacteria to a control group who didn't consume the drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The goal of the study, which is still recruiting participants, is to see if taurine fuels hydrogen sulfide (HS2) metabolizing bacteria, which are 'overrepresented' in colon cancer cases and have been shown to cause inflammation in the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 16:19:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPR2lyR1dicWp3ZV9JSG55cnhSNE0wU2U5ZE1sUDNycS1DRXRzeFh0QUhuMFFrSlZCdW1BUDU0ZU1fSVc1RlNPUm5Yek9GajBfek5EOGJXd0lmNEw4UzhWZGVDTE1ZZUVya1g4WFZSRkpKdXpUS3ExQUFMMDdkSE9lekNzRDhTbTBQbzJmNHJBOS1zcUdoQmsyRUxISndoaEFBd1Y1eU9weV9WQ1lMQVZELQ</guid></item><item><title>根据营养学家的说法，睡前不应该吃的食物- glamour.com | Foods You Should Never Eat Before Bed, According to a Nutritionist - glamour.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFBpejhWc0VUd3lBMlE1eUpTeDRUMjZVeWlDZHN2azk0U3F6NkFRakZyOUlzVV9IYVRVNGd0LXRhaERBbGJfZU12T0NZZnFLUVF4X2Z2NzJCTG1KWGFjU0JTNmZGUEYzMXFSU1BkRWF0allNUko3aHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing quite as satisfying as an indulgent &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/the-healthiest-late-night-snac" target="_blank"&gt;midnight snack,&lt;/a&gt; is there? A little somethin’ somethin’ right before (and maybe even in) bed. Maybe you enjoy snacking on a few pieces of chocolate before you hit the hay. Or perhaps you creep to the fridge at 11 p.m., pull out that leftover takeout, and tuck in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like you, we have some disappointing news—apparently, eating right before bed can cause havoc on the digestive system as you nod off. “Of course there are career or relationship considerations that could get in the way here, but ideally you should aim to have two to four hours between finishing eating and going to bed,” says Kyle Crowley, nutritionist and chief product officer at supplement retailer &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.theproteinworks.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.theproteinworks.com/"}' href="https://www.theproteinworks.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Protein Works&lt;/a&gt;. “This will give you the best chance at reducing physical discomfort from digesting the food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even worse? There are certain foods you should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; eat before bed if you can help it. Read on for what the experts say about which foods are messing with your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Spicy food before bed can sometimes lead to heartburn, which isn’t exactly a recipe for a restful night,” Crowley says. “Plus, chili peppers can raise your body temperature, something that might make it harder for your body to ease into deep sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s true—&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016787609290048G" target="_blank"&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that consuming &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/spicy-foods-chilli-peppers-live-longer" target="_blank"&gt;spicy food&lt;/a&gt; can disrupt sleep and lead to more time awake throughout the night. In fact, people who eat spicy food every day have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35131218/" target="_blank"&gt;4.73 times greater odds of insomnia&lt;/a&gt; than those who never eat spicy food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramen is another spicy dish that it might be best avoid before bed—no matter how tempting that takeout box in the fridge may be. Not only is ramen often spicy, it’s also made with processed noodles that can be &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-to-know-about-ramen-noodles" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-to-know-about-ramen-noodles"}' href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-to-know-about-ramen-noodles" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard to digest&lt;/a&gt;, often taking &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.keckmedicine.org/blog/is-your-ramen-ruining-your-health/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.keckmedicine.org/blog/is-your-ramen-ruining-your-health/"}' href="https://www.keckmedicine.org/blog/is-your-ramen-ruining-your-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;longer than two hours&lt;/a&gt; to work its way through your system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oranges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Acidic foods like citrus fruits can increase your chances of heartburn,” says Crowley. “It might help to enjoy these earlier in the day rather than as a late-night treat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fried chicken&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been there—it’s 2 a.m., you’ve had a little too much to drink, and the allure of some chicken nuggets call out to you. However, as delicious as it can be (especially late at night) fried foods probably aren’t the best food for your late-night meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research shows that fatty foods can reduce sleep quality and lead to more restless nights,” Crowley says. “So avoid heavy, greasy meals like fried chicken close to bedtime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheese&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes all you’ve got in the fridge is a tantalizing block of cheddar. However, it might lead to a weird night’s sleep. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10229376/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt; that dairy products can lead to lighter sleep. In fact, &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/does-cheese-give-you-nightmares-2" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/does-cheese-give-you-nightmares-2"}' href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/does-cheese-give-you-nightmares-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;many people find&lt;/a&gt; that consuming cheese right before bed can lead to vivid dreams and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of this probably comes as bad news to late-night snackers. But while it is better to avoid food altogether at night, there are some foods you should never eat before bed—and there are some foods that will probably sit a little better.

However, as a humble nutrient, fiber is often overlooked. But what if this is the missing ingredient to weight loss success? Can fiber supplements replace whole foods? In this podcast, a nutritionist answers readers’ questions about fiber and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the internet is awash with articles, charts, and recipes centered around eating more protein — anything from a 30-gram-protein breakfast to high-protein drinks and more — to naturally lose weight. And although the key to achieving good weight loss results is indeed a higher protein intake, there is a nutrient that is often overlooked: fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, statistics show that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322007499?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;less than 5%&lt;/a&gt; of Americans realistically meet their recommended daily fiber intake, which is on average up to &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/healthy-eating/fiber-helps-diabetes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;34 grams (g)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; for adult men and about 28 g for adult women. So, how can we eat more fiber?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this episode of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/in-conversation-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;In Conversation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, we’ll be tackling burning questions such as: What is fiber, and why is it important for our bodies? How can we tell whether we are eating enough fiber? Is it right to call fiber nature’s Ozempic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ll differentiate between soluble and insoluble fiber while discussing the ideal daily intake for different people. We’ll also touch on how fiber supplements like psyllium husk compare with whole foods, weighing their benefits for our well-being. We will also look at how fiber plays a crucial role in fighting insulin resistance and its potential role in supporting weight management goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To discuss this and more, we’re joined by registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/authors/lisa-valente" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Lisa Valente&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD. Lisa holds a Master of Science in nutrition communications from the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, and she completed her dietetic internship at Massachusetts General Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the podcast recording, for the readers of &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, we also asked Lisa what her top favorite high fiber foods were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I will say frozen berries, fresh too, but frozen berries tend to be a little bit higher in fiber for a fruit. And when you buy them frozen, they’re just more affordable and easier to have on hand. [T]hey don’t go bad on you in a day — so, you can add those to smoothies or mix them into oatmeal or yogurt,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisa said her second choice would be whole wheat pasta and shared a fun fact about fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Brown rice only has one gram more of fiber than white rice, but whole wheat pasta has significantly more than white pasta. [It creates] like this nice fiber-rich carbohydrate base to your dinner to add some vegetables or protein to,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her third choice was chia seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I sprinkle them on oatmeal, but you can also make chia seed pudding where you soak them with some milk or non-dairy milk and add a little bit of fruit. They’re very filling and they not only have fiber, but they also have omega-3 and a little bit of protein. So I feel like they’re sort of this tiny but mighty little seed where you can check off a lot of nutrition boxes at once. So if I had to pick three, that’s a good starting place for me,” she told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please listen to our podcast episode in full below or on your preferred streaming platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our podcast has also been shortlisted in two categories — Best Health, Wellbeing &amp;amp; Food Podcast and the Best Science &amp;amp; Medical Podcast — at this year’s &lt;a href="https://publisherpodcasts.com/2025/en/page/shortlist2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Publisher Podcast Summit and Awards&lt;/a&gt;.

But consuming extra amounts could make blood cancer more aggressive, the team of experts hailing from the University of Rochester warn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since taurine is a common ingredient in energy drinks... our work suggests that it may be of interest to carefully consider the [risks and] benefits of supplemental taurine in leukemia patients,' the study says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also said while the research is still early, they are &lt;span&gt;'very excited' because targeting taurine production from leukemia cells 'may be a possible avenue for treatment of these aggressive diseases.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an experiment on mice and human leukemia cells, the researchers found stopping taurine from entering cells could slow the progression of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09018-7"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, comes as additional research works to understand &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13493163/red-bull-colon-cancer-crisis-young-people.html"&gt;if taurine could fuel other forms of cancer&lt;/a&gt; like colorectal cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in New York found taurine, an ingredient in energy drinks, could fuel the growth of leukemia cells (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taurine is an non-essential amino acid found naturally in the bone marrow, brain, heart and muscles. It's also found in meat and fish and is used in certain beverages to energize cells and boost mental clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought to help regulate the amount of calcium in nerve cells and control inflammation, among other things. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study looked at mice with a SLC6A6 gene, which transports taurine from different areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also took samples of human leukemia cells and transplanted them into the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team discovered taurine is produced by a subset of healthy cells in bone marrow, where leukemia grows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The SLC6A6 gene then transports taurine from the bone marrow to leukemia cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believe this is the first time taurine has been found in bone marrow, worsening leukemia - a blood cancer that strikes 67,000 Americans and 10,000 people in the UK every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 23,000 Americans and 5,000 Brits are expected to die of the disease this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, as leukemia cells feed on taurine, they go through glycolysis, a process in which cells break down the sugar glucose to produce energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Glycolysis gives cancer cells the energy to divide and multiply, making leukemia more aggressive, causing more cancer cells to form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Jeevisha Bajaj, lead researcher from the Wilmot Cancer Institute at the University of Rochester, said in a press release that further studies should investigate levels of taurine in leukemia patients and look at how to lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is especially crucial because taurine supplements are often recommended to cancer patients, as it may lower inflammation and reduce side effects from chemotherapy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our current data suggest that it would be helpful to develop stable and effective ways to block taurine from entering leukemia cells,' Dr. Bajaj said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taurine is considered safe in small amounts, but higher levels have been shown to cause vomiting, upset stomach, dizziness, diarrhea and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's still unclear the exact role taurine plays in other forms of cancer, though researchers have suspected it could be linked to the alarming rise of colon cancer in young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) shows rates of leukemia have remained steady, though deaths are decreasing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a phase two trial, a team at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/florida/index.html" id="mol-c02e1e20-30bf-11f0-b1d2-353395a3f03f"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; is recruiting adults ages 18 to 40 who have not been diagnosed with colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half of the group is meant to consume at least one Red Bull or Celsius drink every day, and researchers will compare their gut bacteria to a control group who didn't consume the drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The goal of the study, which is still recruiting participants, is to see if taurine fuels hydrogen sulfide (HS2) metabolizing bacteria, which are 'overrepresented' in colon cancer cases and have been shown to cause inflammation in the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 15:09:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPR2lyR1dicWp3ZV9JSG55cnhSNE0wU2U5ZE1sUDNycS1DRXRzeFh0QUhuMFFrSlZCdW1BUDU0ZU1fSVc1RlNPUm5Yek9GajBfek5EOGJXd0lmNEw4UzhWZGVDTE1ZZUVya1g4WFZSRkpKdXpUS3ExQUFMMDdkSE9lekNzRDhTbTBQbzJmNHJBOS1zcUdoQmsyRUxISndoaEFBd1Y1eU9weV9WQ1lMQVZELdIBtgFBVV95cUxNT3ZwUlhKTHhXMGJqVDVwSmZGbC1YZXNVSHRqaW56SVFNbEF5dTJYeEp4bTFjSDE4LUk5eTFqSEsxellJY2tqalNndTl3Y1lNSE5tbkVUOU5aMHljMld6NUYxQ1JqLUhFTVUwcHZONElDb282dWtweFdWLXo5bzVyUXlsRS1xNDI5RnZ3ZUVUQXdWNHVKRnlxUmhaTFJTd1VYOHhlSVR3ZEROa2FXQzVoR0xoX1E4dw</guid></item><item><title>人类“超级免疫力” –被蛇咬超过100次的男人有助于创造革命性的抗蛇毒血清- SciTechDaily | Human “Super Immunity” – Man Bitten by Snakes Over 100 Times Helps Create Revolutionary Antivenom - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPWkFWc1R2M25haVoyZDJ3WjMzc1dvZUJiQjJ0NmthZ3ZBbHZ0bUdfVzJtbHB0UlFNVnQwN3ByTnpqaERJcUdoLUdpRF9PNDhvTWlDSHdyY3VUM1hpZzgzNU1qMEZSWHM4V09qOTF4RG9qenFZd1c1R2tEMWh4dmxrRWc5ZXlNTVZfYWR4MERxNjFsc0xCZUU2blEwRVRGVTNueUxrSldEYXNpUEZxR21qakpnemxsaVJwdjhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 15:01:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPWkFWc1R2M25haVoyZDJ3WjMzc1dvZUJiQjJ0NmthZ3ZBbHZ0bUdfVzJtbHB0UlFNVnQwN3ByTnpqaERJcUdoLUdpRF9PNDhvTWlDSHdyY3VUM1hpZzgzNU1qMEZSWHM4V09qOTF4RG9qenFZd1c1R2tEMWh4dmxrRWc5ZXlNTVZfYWR4MERxNjFsc0xCZUU2blEwRVRGVTNueUxrSldEYXNpUEZxR21qakpnemxsaVJwdjhR</guid></item><item><title>我真的需要关心我的骨密度吗？ -切口 | Do I Really Need to Care About My Bone Density? - The Cut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE84RjhFakladGVIVGJDakg0WGxqOVVJQTJURzU1VVBKd1JTaTZ4Mnk0U3FMMjJOa2NwUkhFZFFONG1IRmtMa2hUVzVBd3hwQzU5amVxVUhUakZGOHNhU0ZmMHg3SWpDS20yNmpiT2VPbXliUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content inline" data-editable="content"&gt;

The workout itself was fine, but it was an offhand comment the instructor made about bone density that got me. Hers, she said, was exceptionally good. She’d recently gotten a bone scan and had been told by her doctor that she had &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; bone density for her age (she is in her early 30s). She attributed her wonderful bones to Pilates and moved on, but I didn’t. We were all told as children to drink our milk for strong bones, but I’d never really thought about my bone health beyond that. Suddenly, I was worried that I’d been neglecting it. When was the last time &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; chugged a tall glass of milk?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z0rb001e3b78uzkdekec@published" data-word-count="153"&gt;In the following months, I began to see the term pop up more and more, usually in the context of fitness and exercise, on TikTok, on Instagram, and even in the occasional real-life conversation. It was always referenced casually and knowingly, with people offering workout routines or &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/whats-going-on-with-cottage-cheese-tiktok-recipe-trend.html"&gt;nutrition advice they claimed&lt;/a&gt; we should all be following. Rebekah Rotstein, who founded the bone-health exercise platform &lt;a href="https://buff-bones.com/"&gt;Buff Bones&lt;/a&gt;, attributes bone density’s newfound popularity, at least in part, to the boom in menopause awareness (which we can also trace to &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; boom, this one in &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/11/menopause-celebrity-business-stacy-london-naomi-watts-judy-greer.html"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/perimenopause-gold-rush-healthcare-companies-treatments.html"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;-related businesses in recent years). “&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/millennials-midlife-crisis-money-job-security.html"&gt;Midlife is having a big moment now&lt;/a&gt;,” she says. “There’s a lot more attention to menopause, and one of the silent &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/what-is-perimenopause-symptoms-explained.html"&gt;symptoms of menopause&lt;/a&gt; is bone loss. Osteoporosis is considered a silent disease in the sense that you have no sensation or feeling that you’re losing bone. It’s painless unless you’ve had a fracture.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z0tn001f3b7844c0iuwi@published" data-word-count="94"&gt;From social media, I eventually formed a vague understanding that lifting weights would make my bones … denser? Still, I didn’t totally understand what bone density was or how it was relevant to me. Was it even? (Spoiler: It absolutely was.) I spoke with four experts to answer these questions and all of our FAQs about what bone density is and how to maintain it. I’m happy to report that the answers were simpler and more whimsical than you may think — and, personally, I’ll never think of my bones the same way again.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z0x9001h3b78yz43tqg6@published" data-word-count="114"&gt;It’s a pretty straightforward term; bone density is the density of your bones. But what does that look like, exactly? &lt;a href="https://www.nyarthritis.com/index.php/meet-dr-stella-bard/"&gt;Dr. Stella Bard&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical rheumatologist, uses the analogy of a honeycomb to explain bone structure to her patients: It’s a latticelike network. “It has empty spaces where the bone was resorbed,” Bard explains. And that honeycomb is constantly remodeling itself. “Bone is not what you think it is,” she says. “You have living cells inside the bone called osteoclasts and osteoblasts. The way I remember it is the osteoclast chews — the C stands for “chewing,” and it chews up old bone. And then comes along an osteoblast that builds it back up.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z1ab001i3b787o8kfklg@published" data-word-count="94"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drvondawright.com/"&gt;Dr. Vonda Wright&lt;/a&gt;, an orthopedic sports surgeon and researcher and the author of &lt;em&gt;Unbreakable&lt;/em&gt;, says that, in addition to being the structure that gives shape to our muscles and organs, bone is itself a metabolic organ system. “Bone is where our blood cells are made,” she says. “We think of it as just dry bones, right? But it is a living dynamic organism that replaces itself every ten years.” If you have good bone density, it means that your bone structure is rebuilding itself at approximately the same rate as it is being resorbed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z1d1001j3b78p4kjnkyn@published" data-word-count="96"&gt;Bone density isn’t the only component of your overall bone health, but it is the easiest to measure. “We talk about bone density as this discrete entity, but we know now that it’s not just about the density itself,” says &lt;a href="https://www.hss.edu/physicians_serota-alana.asp"&gt;Dr. Alana Serota&lt;/a&gt;, an internal medicine doctor who specializes in metabolic bone disorders, osteoporosis, and women’s health. “It’s not just the quantity, but the quality of the bone, which is a little more nebulous. So bone density is not the only factor, but it’s an important factor in bone health. It’s sort of a blunt instrument.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z1e7001k3b787vjo1fqe@published" data-word-count="73"&gt;And it accounts for about 60 to 70 percent of bone strength, says Rotstein. “The hard mineralization within bone is what makes it dense,” she explains. “But if bone is only that side of the scale, it also is problematic, and there’s pathologies when bones become too brittle. On the other side, you do want resilience and flexibility within the bone. That’s where collagen comes in. You want a good balance of these.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z1ja001l3b78j5yat6ol@published" data-word-count="122"&gt;When our osteoclasts are chewing up our bones more quickly than our osteoblasts can rebuild them, our bone density starts to lower — eventually leading to osteoporosis, a condition of weak and brittle bones. Going back to Bard’s honeycomb analogy, “With less of the lattice and architecture available, it’s more likely to shatter,” she says. “Like an eggshell — it’s very fragile and it’s very easy to crack and break. Osteoporosis really means holes in the bones. The bones already have holes in them; it just means more holes in the bones, bigger holes in the bones.” That means your bones are significantly more likely to break or fracture, and have a much harder time repairing themselves in the case of injury.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z1oa001n3b78ygns27zl@published" data-word-count="92"&gt;Well, everyone is. As we age, we start breaking down bone faster than we’re building it. In particular, those of us born with ovaries are at a higher risk, especially once we hit menopause. “We lose up to 20 percent of our bone mass in the first five to seven years after menopause,” says Rotstein. “In menopause, we don’t have estrogen anymore; we’re still building bone through the osteoblast,” explains Wright. “Estrogen helps control the osteoclast, the bone-breakdown cell, and so there’s a mismatch and we’re breaking down more than we’re building.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z1py001o3b78domxeqp2@published" data-word-count="52"&gt;You don’t go straight to osteoporosis, though. Rotstein says we should also be looking out for its precursor, osteopenia. “More than 80 percent of fragility fractures actually occur in women with osteopenia,” she says. That’s at least partially because significantly more people have osteopenia than osteoporosis, but it’s worth paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z1ts001p3b782hkrcaxr@published" data-word-count="65"&gt;“The risk of death after a hip fracture is higher than the risk of death after a heart attack,” says Serota. “It’s just we don’t have a cute ribbon; we’re not good with our PR. It doesn’t seem as dramatic as it is.” And because of factors like menopause and longer lifespans, people with uteruses have a much higher incidence of osteoporosis, about 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z1yu001q3b78i34ge93j@published" data-word-count="109"&gt;There’s a range of other risk factors to think about, too, says Wright. “We build bone across our lifespan, and our peak bone mass is supposed to occur in our early 30s,” she explains. But many of her patients have had to take medications that break down bone throughout their lives, are smokers or vapers, have lived sedentary lifestyles, or were athletes who didn’t eat enough. A full list of risk factors can be found &lt;a href="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/osteoporosis"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If any of them apply to you, it’s probably a good idea to get a bone scan early. Recommendations vary, but Wright says that you should get your first one by age 40.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z20n001r3b78sved3ymt@published" data-word-count="32"&gt;Bottom line: “Everybody has the potential to lose bone,” says Wright. “Not everybody &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; lose bone, because you can get in front of this, which is what I want people to do.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z23x001t3b78ucyib7nm@published" data-word-count="107"&gt;The longtime gold standard scan is a DEXA scan, which uses X-ray technology to measure bone density. Bard describes it as “the easiest test you’ll ever take.” It involves lying down on a table while a scanning arm scans your bones. “A lot of it depends on the machine that’s doing the scanning, and we tell people to pick a place that’s close to home, that’s convenient for you, because it’s better to use the same machine to scan you every two years,” says Bard. “Your insurance will normally pay for every two years unless you’re osteoporotic, in which case it might pay for annual bone-density screenings.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z25j001u3b78dnv77zhy@published" data-word-count="47"&gt;There’s also the &lt;a href="https://www.aaos.org/aaosnow/2024/dec/clinical/clinical02/#:~:text=Radiofrequency%20echographic%20multi%2Dspectrometry%20(REMS)%20is%20an%20ultrasound%20technology,a%20predictor%20of%20fracture%20risk."&gt;REMS scan&lt;/a&gt;, which uses ultrasound technology to evaluate bone density &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; bone quality, says Wright. But while there’s a lot of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10217295/'"&gt;promising research&lt;/a&gt; for this type of scan, since it’s still very new, it’s not as widely recommended or widely used as of yet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z28n001v3b78e8ydnkfq@published" data-word-count="78"&gt;Bard, Wright, Serota, and Rotstein all recommend getting scanned early, while you have time to improve your bone density if your results aren’t what you expected. Wright says every patient who comes into her clinic gets referred for a bone scan, and they generally aren’t too difficult to come by — you can even pay to get one at some gyms. If you want your insurance to cover it, though, you will need a referral from your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z2ff001x3b78ssl1l01y@published" data-word-count="46"&gt;I’ll be honest: I was a little skeptical that Pilates was the key to my bone health, and at the idea that my workout routine (or lack thereof, most of the time) would affect my bones at all. On this, I was once again &lt;em&gt;dead wrong&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z2ki001y3b78qjq6ccn4@published" data-word-count="103"&gt;There are three types of exercise most important for bone health. The first is the one you’ve probably heard about: weight-bearing exercise, which can mean anything from strength-based movements that take advantage of your body weight to lifting heavy in the gym. That could include Pilates. “I count Pilates as strength training,” Wright says. “You’re engaging your muscles, you are working on strength.” But while some &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0251391"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3233/BMR-150604"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; indicate that Pilates can help improve your bone density, Serota, Wright, Bard, and Rotstein all say that lifting weights is the most effective, proven form of strength training you can do to target bone health.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z2pl001z3b7817vym7xh@published" data-word-count="113"&gt;More surprising for me was the importance of simply jumping around. Turns out being fun and whimsical has a side effect of increasing your bone density. “We must impact our bones,” says Wright. “Every jumping exercise that could possibly be will help build better bone: Jumping 20 times a day, or doing ten minutes of dedicated jumping, as simple as skipping, jumping rope, hopscotch, literally jumping up and down at your desk and landing hard with impact, can help build bone.” Rotstein says explosive movements that train your ability to rapidly produce force are also important: Kickboxing, medicine-ball throwing, and any performance or athletic training that involves speed would fall under this category.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z2rc00203b788knsgq3h@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;The last expert-recommended form of exercise is not as directly related to building bone density but is essential for protecting your bones over time. That’s right, give it up for balance. The sooner you start thinking about it, the better. “You want to integrate balance into your life, because even the most elite athletes, an injury will undo their balance,” says Serota. “Stand at the sink and brush your teeth and stand on one leg. Make that part of your practice and your life.” If you’re looking to target your balance more intentionally, Rotstein says yoga, tai chi, and Pilates are all great options that will help with neuromuscular control, balance, proprioception, and fall prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z2t100213b78mgf8t1ew@published" data-word-count="58"&gt;Ultimately, says Bard, “whatever exercises the muscle also exercises the bone and encourages bone building.” It’s not always realistic to maintain the perfect, multimodal fitness routine, but taking ten minutes to jump up and down or stand on one leg can make a difference. “The goal is,” Serota says, “you’re sweating more days of the week than not.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmal4z2uv00223b78h7f2d3vg@published" data-word-count="108"&gt;“All the things that are good for your health anyway will be good for your bones,” Serota adds. That’s true for exercise and for nutrition, too. Most of us have heard our whole lives that calcium is essential for strong bones, but so is vitamin D (and K2 along with it). “Vitamin D is the vitamin that makes sure that calcium is pushed in and builds the bone,” Bard explains. But make sure you’re getting enough calcium for the vitamin D to do its work: “If you don’t provide your body with the brick, it’s not going to have the materials to build up the bone,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

The best source is, as we all know, milk and other dairy products. But many people are lactose intolerant (including myself), and while there are plenty of plant-based foods that contain calcium, like leafy greens and tofu, Serota says those who don’t eat dairy should probably be taking a supplement. She recommends non-dairy milks and other drinks, like orange juice, that are supplemented with calcium or encapsulated calcium citrate.&lt;/p&gt;

So no matter what your bone-scan results are, there are steps you can take. As for me, I’ll be digging out my jump rope from the depths of my closet.&lt;/p&gt;

While your facial hair is crawling with microorganisms, it’s very unlikely that your mustache or beard is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/08/16/toilet-plume-germs/" target="_blank"&gt;germier than your commode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PJ7HR3G6K5D3PL4X3JBCTTEG54" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The notion that beards are potential carriers of disease dates back about six decades. In a 1967 study,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;microbiologist Manuel S. Barbeito and his colleagues sprayed participants’ &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC547091/" target="_blank"&gt;beards with bacteria&lt;/a&gt; and found that the bacteria remained after washing with soap and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MCWCOT3OG5DPHM3CP4SFNONNUA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The idea resurfaced years later — but this time, comparing bacteria in beards to those found in toilets — and has remained pervasive online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SZVOHYGKORCSBCCILGJPEJAJAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Human skin is crawling with microorganisms, such as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/11/12/skin-microbiome-diseases/" target="_blank"&gt;bacteria, viruses and fungi&lt;/a&gt;. We even have &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/05/31/demodex-mite-eyelashes/" target="_blank"&gt;mites living in our eyelashes&lt;/a&gt;. “But not all organisms that we find on the skin are bad,” said &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/slipner" target="_blank"&gt;Shari Lipner&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of clinical dermatology at Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="36R3243X3NC3JMTKYQZMSSDYOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There are bacteria all over our bodies, so there are bacteria in beards, too,” said &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3543/kimberly-m-davis" target="_blank"&gt;Kimberly Davis&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="63NOM2STVNAS5GMJGRYMNOBXXE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Microorganisms are not typically a problem unless they are pathogenic and enter the body through cuts, sores or other breaks in the skin. Even then, “our bodies have a remarkable capability to control and eliminate microbes,” Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X3AHUJPDJZGGLBWUGPTQ5KYG3M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Germs in facial hair may be more of a consideration in hospital settings. Surgical masks help protect patients from potential bacteria and other microorganisms from health-care workers’ noses and mouths. But in one small study, researchers investigated how bacteria still may be shed from their faces, particularly when moving their masks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BJUVMQDMMBBQ3A62TKKH2YNO4I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The researchers reported that there was &lt;a href="https://associationofanaesthetists-publications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2044.2000.055002173.x" target="_blank"&gt;more bacterial shedding among bearded men&lt;/a&gt; than among clean-shaven men both when their masks were at rest as well as when their masks were “wiggled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HCTAUQRAK5EBJFG4S6TZI5FMDQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A study of more than 400 male health-care workers found, however, that &lt;a href="https://www.journalofhospitalinfection.com/article/S0195-6701(14)00090-5/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;those with facial hair did not carry more bacteria&lt;/a&gt; than their clean-shaven colleagues. Certain types of pathogens that can cause skin and other infections were actually more prevalent among those without facial hair.

In contrast, disliked vegetables like beets or sprouts are typically rejected due to distaste, an aversion based on taste or texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that meat rejection involves deeper psychological and evolutionary mechanisms, possibly linked to avoiding pathogens. Researchers believe this emotional response strengthens with intentional meat avoidance, such as during Veganuary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disgust vs. Distaste:&lt;/strong&gt; Meat is rejected with disgust, while vegetables are rejected due to distaste.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pathogen Avoidance:&lt;/strong&gt; Disgust toward meat may have evolved to help humans avoid disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavior Reinforcement:&lt;/strong&gt; The disgust response can strengthen with deliberate meat avoidance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many vegetarians who reject meat feel disgust which closely matches the aversion others feel to the idea of eating human flesh, feces or dog meat, new research has found.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by the University of Exeter set out to investigate whether there is a difference in the psychological mechanisms by which people reject meat compared to vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an online study involving 300 people (mostly vegetarians), researchers found that people who reject vegetables they dislike do so because they feel ‘distaste’ – a simple aversion to taste, texture, or smell of a food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, when people dislike and reject meat that would be considered appetising by omnivores (such as roast chicken or beef steak), they feel the more complex emotion disgust, in a similar way that meat-eaters were disgusted by the idea of eating human meat, feces, or dog meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Natalia Lawrence, of the University of Exeter said: “This is the most robust evidence to date that we reject meat and vegetables that we find repellent based on different underlying processes. Obviously finding meat disgusting can help people avoid eating it, which has health and environmental benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other research we’ve conducted suggests that these feelings of disgust may develop when people deliberately reduce or avoid eating meat, such as during Veganuary ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Appetite,&lt;/em&gt; recruited 252 people who reject meat and 57 omnivores who eat meat. Researchers tested responses to images of 11 different substances (palatable meat; vegetables which are commonly disliked, such olives, sprouts, raw aubergine, and beetroot. Participants were asked several questions about how eating each of the foods would make them feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each question was linked to either disgust (e.g. ‘&lt;em&gt;I would dislike any dish which contained even the tiniest amount of this food, even if I could not taste, smell, feel, or see it.’&lt;/em&gt;) or distaste (e.g. ’&lt;em&gt;I would dislike the taste, smell, or texture of this food.’&lt;/em&gt;) which allowed the researchers to make a distinction between what people felt (disgust or distaste) when they rejected different foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compare reactions, the meat-eating participants were also shown images of substances which everyone considers disgusting to eat: human flesh, dog meat and faeces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team recorded 557 rejections of meat (up to three rejections from 252 people), and 670 rejections of vegetables (up to 2 rejections each from 309 people). Where participants said they would not eat the item pictured, they completed questions to investigate the grounds for rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistently, people rejected vegetables they did not like based on distaste, and rejected meat and disgust elicitors in a strikingly similar disgust pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Elisa Becker, who conducted the work at the University of Exeter and has since moved to Oxford University, said: “Meat eaters responded to the idea of eating these truly disgusting substances like faeces in the same way that vegetarians responded to images of meat that they didn’t want to eat, and this was very different from the way they responded to vegetables they rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although we may think we’re rejecting a food simply because we don’t want to eat it, we showed that the basis for this rejection is quite different – and we think that’s evolved to protect us from pathogens that can lie undetected in meat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this food aversion and emotion research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f282809781819d94949b9197b2978a97869780dc9391dc8799" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Louise Vennells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://exeter.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Louise Vennells – University of Exeter&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2025.108033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Disgust and Distaste – Differential mechanisms for the rejection of plant- and animal-source foods&lt;/a&gt;” by Natalia Lawrence et al. &lt;em&gt;Appetite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disgust and Distaste – Differential mechanisms for the rejection of plant- and animal-source foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People may reject foods due to distaste (an affective reaction to undesirable sensory properties) or disgust (an emotive response to the idea of what a food represents). Disgust can further be classified into sub-types: core, animal-reminder, and moral disgust, all of which could influence food rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research suggests different rejection mechanisms for plant and animal foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested this in an online study in a meat-rejecting sample (mostly vegetarians, n = 252), and a meat-accepting sample (omnivores, n = 57).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants rated foods they rejected for consumption on criteria related to distaste (e.g. objection to taste), general disgust (e.g. contamination potential of the food), and specific disgust sub-types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratings across these criteria created unique response profiles for commonly disliked vegetables, meats, universal disgust elicitors, and accepted food (control).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual inspection of response profiles, correlations, and a multidimensional scaling analysis all revealed that plant foods were rejected based on distaste, whereas rejection responses to palatable meat closely matched responses to human meat, faeces, and dog meat (disgust elicitors), both rejected based on disgust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspecting disgust response profiles suggested that core disgust was the primary disgust type, with animal-reminder and moral disgust sometimes experienced in addition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study confirms differential rejection mechanisms for plant-based foods (rejected via distaste) and meat (core disgust).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests different evolutionary strategies humans had to adapt to cope with plant toxins detectable through distaste and pathogens found in meat not detectable by taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such adaptations could be leveraged in future interventions to reduce meat consumption or increase vegetable intake.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 12:42:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE1DcjZsYzBfb3pfTktCWjBpckNPcmEzaHdBOFdldlhvSGc3dFNoeXMtNC1VSmJqdVh4c1NVSEluTkttM2p2eVJ4Uk82UjBnR0J6UThGSEhSWHgwb3JRV0JuajZJSDkxcHBxdHZqbW5INA</guid></item><item><title>这种疾病会杀死最脆弱的婴儿。我们可以阻止它。- vox.com | This illness kills babies at their most vulnerable.

Countries where poverty was once near-universal, like India or Indonesia, &lt;a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=ID-IN"&gt;are now considered middle-income&lt;/a&gt;. Some populous countries in sub-Saharan Africa, like Kenya or Nigeria, are, if not completely politically stable, now possessed of enough real state capacity to try &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(22)00369-2/fulltext"&gt;ambitious projects&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/kenya-is-overhauling-its-national-healthcare-scheme-after-58-years-what-would-make-the-transition-less-painful-240963"&gt;universal health coverage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The resources available to these nations are still highly limited by rich-world standards.

Sepsis is a catch-all term for infections that provoke an overwhelming immune response, damaging internal organs, and in the worst cases, leading to death. Sepsis can in principle be caused by anything — a virus, a fungus, a protozoa — but in practice, most infants who get it get it from a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15371-sepsis-in-newborns"&gt;bacterial infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In one way, that’s good: We have antibiotics! In another way, it’s bad: The &lt;a href="/future-perfect/353420/drug-resistant-bacteria-are-killing-more-and-more-humans-we-need-new-weapons"&gt;risk of antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt; means you don’t want to overuse them.

The main technique is “&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-a-blood-culture-test"&gt;blood culturing&lt;/a&gt;,” which involves taking blood from the patient, putting it in a liquid “culture” that reacts if bacteria are present, and waiting to see the reaction show up. This is expensive and often takes two to three days, potentially delaying life-saving treatment. It also has very high “false negative” rates, with &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/tropej/article-abstract/61/1/1/1647506?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;studies showing that a large share of neonatal sepsis cases&lt;/a&gt; occur in babies who test negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;Sign up &lt;a href="/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

The estimates we have on the toll of neonatal sepsis aren’t precise, but the &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/334216/9789240010789-eng.pdf#page=25"&gt;best figure I’ve seen, from the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), is a range of 400,000 to 700,000 deaths a year. That’s in the same ballpark as malaria (&lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria#malaria-death-estimates-from-who"&gt;600 to 700,000 a year&lt;/a&gt;) and HIV/AIDS (&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-hiv-hepatitis-and-stis-programmes/hiv/strategic-information/hiv-data-and-statistics"&gt;630,000 deaths in 2023&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.healthdata.org/research-analysis/diseases-injuries-risks/factsheets/2021-neonatal-sepsis-and-other-neonatal"&gt;studies go lower&lt;/a&gt; (more like 200,000) but, because they &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8311109/#:~:text=Contrary%20to%20most%20studies%20that%20we%20included%20in%20our%20review%2C%20cases%20of%20pneumonia%20are%20captured%20in%20the%20GBD%20modelling%20of%20pneumonia%20as%20a%20separate%20entity%2C%20but%20not%20as%20neonatal%20sepsis%20cases"&gt;exclude infant deaths&lt;/a&gt; from pneumonia-caused sepsis, underestimate the number of deaths that could be saved by better targeting antibiotics to babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The team behind NeoTest — which includes physician and global health research Akhil Bansal, Center for Global Development head Rachel Glennerster, economist and House of Lords member Jim O’Neill, and Nobel-winning economist Michael Kremer — aims to improve that targeting by getting a better test, one that gives results within minutes and is cheap to produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="if-you-fund-it-they-will-come" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;If you fund it, they will come&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The NeoTest team does not, itself, consist of medical test manufacturers. But in Glennerster and Kremer, it includes two of the inventors of a tool called an “&lt;a href="/future-perfect/21439799/covid-19-vaccine-pfizer-moderna-priority-access-covax-who"&gt;advance market commitment&lt;/a&gt;” (AMC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;AMCs are a way to communicate to companies that there’s a big market for a product which doesn’t yet exist. The participants, which can include governments or other businesses or philanthropists, commit to buying a set amount of the new product, at a set price, from any manufacturers who meet the deal’s specifications. The hope is that this provides an incentive for manufacturers to develop the product, because they know for a fact there will be demand for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s worked before. The &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/five-nations-and-the-bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation-launch-advance-market-commitment-for-vaccines"&gt;first AMC&lt;/a&gt;, for better vaccines against pneumococcal bacteria at a time when that &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/240895/WER8212_93-104.PDF#page=4"&gt;disease was killing as many as 1 million children a year&lt;/a&gt;, resulted in three new vaccines being developed, and in the number of vaccine doses &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/evaluations/Gavi-PCV-AMC-pilot-2nd-Outcomes-and-impact-evaluation-Final-report.pdf#page=50"&gt;growing from just 3 million in 2010 to around 150 million in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. By one estimate from Kremer and co-authors, the &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26775/w26775.pdf"&gt;new vaccines enabled by the AMC&lt;/a&gt; saved some 700,000 lives between 2010 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;NeoTest is an attempt to put together funds — about $120 million in total — for an advance market commitment for a better neonatal sepsis test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;More famously, Operation Warp Speed, the US effort that got effective vaccines against Covid-19 on the market less than a year after the pandemic began, used a purchasing mechanism that worked quite a bit like an AMC. The government &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200722152445/https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/07/22/us-government-engages-pfizer-produce-millions-doses-covid-19-vaccine.html"&gt;purchased hundreds of millions of doses&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200707124316/https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/07/07/hhs-dod-collaborate-novavax-produce-millions-covid-19-investigational-vaccine-doses-commercial-scale-manufacturing-demonstration-projects.html"&gt;vaccine manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200521122749/https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/05/21/trump-administration-accelerates-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-to-be-available-beginning-in-october.html"&gt;months before&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200418081325/https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-award-us-government-agency-barda-483-million/"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; were in fact approved — giving the pharma firms confidence to start producing doses in large numbers, and encouraging them to keep up their R&amp;amp;D work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;NeoTest is an attempt to put together funds — about $120 million in total — for an advance market commitment for a better neonatal sepsis test. Test manufacturers who are willing to sell for $8 per test ($5 funded by the AMC, $3 by the government of the country receiving the tests) would be guaranteed at least 24 million subsidized orders. Ideally, the test will settle at around $3 as a final price, with the initial subsidy helping fund initial costs associated with developing the tests and setting up manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A rapid test is not some outlandish dream. Neonatal sepsis experts have been saying we need better diagnostics for years; there’s a whole &lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/9/9/e015862"&gt;Neonatal Sepsis Diagnosis Working Group that puts out papers&lt;/a&gt; explaining the problem. The WHO has put together a detailed description of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/call-for-public-consultation-target-product-profile-for-tests-of-neonatal-sepsis"&gt;what a useful rapid test for sepsis might look like&lt;/a&gt;, including elements like the size of the blood draw required and the ideal wait for results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Rapid, point-of-care tests that can give answers in minutes are common at this point for viruses like Covid and the flu, and already exist for some &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com/shop/first-to-know-syphilis-test-kit-1-ct-prodid-625207"&gt;bacterial infections like syphilis&lt;/a&gt;. But in part because neonatal sepsis is so concentrated in poor countries, developing a test for it hasn’t been a priority for profit-driven firms to date. Dangling $120 million in front of them might change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="this-is-a-problem-developing-countries-could-solve-as-a-group" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;This is a problem developing countries could solve as a group&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One of the most intriguing aspects of NeoTest to me is that Akhil Bansal, the physician who first devised the idea, is pitching it first to governments of middle- income countries (India, Kenya, South Africa, etc.) that might actually use the test in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;$120 million is a decent sum, but not enormous for a global health project. The pneumococcal AMC, by contrast, was for $1.5 billion. And it’s totally within the budgets of some middle-income countries to contribute a portion of that $120 million, especially when the result is a product that will save the lives of thousands of babies every year in their country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Of course, money is money, and if any foreign aid professionals in upper-income countries or philanthropists reading this piece want to support NeoTest, they should — they’re still actively fundraising and are in need of support. The most important thing is that the problem gets solved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But I found the approach of going first to countries directly benefiting for funding intriguing, and surprisingly heartening at what is otherwise a dark time for global health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For one thing, it’s remarkable and encouraging that enough middle-income countries have gotten to the point where funding an initiative like this is within their budgets. That wasn’t true 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;More importantly, though, it serves as a reminder that the work of development will continue with or without Western governments’ support. That support is invaluable, and I hope it returns. But the Global South is resilient, and increasingly shows an ability to solve big problems for itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the Future Perfect newsletter. &lt;a href="/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup"&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNQjR1ZUhmMWxkVnlOOFh2dFRTR2tKOUw1R1E1OG9ON09wQzEtYktMd1g4Yk5GVW4yS0pBS29YMi1Kb0liZmtyQ2FpWW9meTJ1NW9wVk9yTzFBdEVxcERCcGRJVU9QZG4wekViR2NwemxPTl95bHNYRi1BZFRBMHVzeUc3N1Y0alV5ZENPUTI2bVU</guid></item><item><title>您的基因与环境的相互作用如何改变您的疾病风险-新的研究计算方式-对话 | How your genes interact with your environment changes your disease risk − new research counts the ways - The Conversation</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0AFBVV95cUxNMUUtZHpfdHNuaFplWTVtR3lBc3ZSemV4ZXowdmViS1VaRHBaeHFUSmEwV1BSaTJiM1IxbGhuZFhSbG5SU1NaUi1YS04ydVo0OGtNNjdmTmVfbENRNDdNSzE4ZVJEbGpSdW9OMFdmbVN4RzY1bmkzTUNwMGtCMXZUTWlEUk16RFhjbVlFSDNwYmlqSTlsSHc0cmRPWlNRVTFod2h1YXV4NlU0bEREeTVPR3NvTU9NZmNnVmJTekU4T0N2NVlyTlluUXFfUng3WUVM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sitting in my doctor’s examination room, I was surprised when she told me, “Genetics don’t really matter for chronic disease.” Rather, she continued, “A person’s lifestyle, what they eat, and how much they exercise, determine whether they get heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a researcher who &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZisO_BUAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;studies the genetics of disease&lt;/a&gt;, I don’t fully disagree – &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/environmental-health-tracking/php/data-research/lifestyle-risk-factors.html"&gt;lifestyle factors&lt;/a&gt; play a large role in determining who gets a disease and who doesn’t. But they are far from the entire story. Since scientists &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-human-genome-project-pieced-together-only-92-of-the-dna-now-scientists-have-finally-filled-in-the-remaining-8-176138"&gt;mapped out the human genome&lt;/a&gt; in 2003, researchers have learned that genetics also play a large role in a person’s disease risk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies that focus on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3941"&gt;estimating disease heritability&lt;/a&gt; – that is, how much genetic differences explain differences in disease risk – usually attribute a substantial fraction of disease variation to genetics. Mutations across the entire genome seem to play a role in diseases such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-022-01058-3"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, which is about &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0241-6"&gt;17% heritable&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04434-5"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, which is about &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-023-02293-8"&gt;80% heritable&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast to diseases such as &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/Genetic-Disorders/Tay-Sachs-Disease"&gt;Tay-Sachs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/cystic-fibrosis/causes"&gt;cystic fibrosis&lt;/a&gt;, where mutations in a single gene cause a disease, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abi8206"&gt;chronic diseases tend to be polygenic&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they’re influenced by multiple mutations at many genes across the whole genome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every complex disease has both genetic and environmental risk factors. Most researchers study these factors separately because of technical challenges and a lack of large, uniform datasets. Although some have devised techniques to overcome these challenges, they haven’t yet been applied to a comprehensive set of diseases and environmental exposures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our recently published research, my colleague &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JX656y0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Alkes Price&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.at/citations?user=ZisO_BUAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;and I&lt;/a&gt; developed tools to leverage newly available datasets to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.01.014"&gt;quantify the joint effects&lt;/a&gt; that genetic and environmental risk factors have on the biology underlying disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Aspirin, genetics and colon cancer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the effect gene-environment interactions have on disease, let’s consider the example of aspirin use and colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2001, researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center were studying how &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11325819/"&gt;regularly taking aspirin&lt;/a&gt; decreased the risk of colon cancer. They wondered whether genetic mutations that slowed down how quickly the body broke down aspirin – meaning aspirin levels in the body would stay high longer – might increase the drug’s protective effect against colon cancer. They were right: Only patients with slow aspirin metabolism had a decreased risk of colon cancer, indicating that the effectiveness of a drug can depend on a person’s genetics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This raises the question of how genetics and different &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/your-environment-affects-how-well-your-medications-work-identifying-exactly-how-could-make-medicine-better-246476"&gt;combinations of environmental exposures&lt;/a&gt;, such as the medications a patient is taking, can affect a person’s disease risk and how effective a treatment will be for them. How many cases of genetic variations directly influencing a drug’s effectiveness are there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Rather than ‘nature versus nurture,’ a more accurate way of describing gene-environment interactions is ‘nature through nurture.’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gene-environment interaction of colon cancer and aspirin is unusual. It involves a mutation at a single location in the genome that has a big effect on colon cancer risk. The past 25 years of human genetics have shown researchers that these sorts of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08494"&gt;large-effect mutations are rare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, an analysis found that the median effect of a genetic variant on height is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038"&gt;only 0.14 millimeters&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, there are usually hundreds of variations that each have small but cumulative effects on a person’s disease risk, making them hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could researchers detect these small gene-environment interactions across hundreds of spots in the genome?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Polygenic gene-environment interactions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started by looking for cases where genetic variants across the genome showed different effects on a person’s biology in different environments. Rather than trying to detect the small effects of each genetic variant one at a time, we &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.01.014"&gt;aggregated data across the entire genome&lt;/a&gt; to turn these small individual effects into a large, genome-wide effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using data from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt; – a large database containing genetic and health data from about 500,000 people – we estimated the influence of millions of genetic variants on 33 complex traits and diseases, such as height and asthma. We grouped people based on environmental exposures such as air pollution, cigarette smoking and dietary patterns. Finally, we developed statistical tests to study how the effects of genetics on disease risk and &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/biomarker"&gt;biomarker levels&lt;/a&gt; varied with these exposures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found three types of gene-environment interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we found &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.01.014"&gt;19 pairs&lt;/a&gt; of complex traits and environmental exposures that are influenced by genetic variants across the genome. For example, the effect of genetics on white blood cell levels in the body differed between smokers and nonsmokers. When we compared the effects of genetic mutations between the two groups, the strength of gene-environment interaction suggested that smoking changes the way genetics influence white blood cell counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we looked for cases where the heritability of a trait varies depending on the environment. In other words, rather than some genetic variants having different effects in different environments, all of them are made stronger in some environments. For example, we found that the heritability of body mass index – the ratio of weight to height – increased by 5% for the most active people. This means genetics plays a larger role in BMI the more active you are. We found &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.01.014"&gt;28 such trait-environment pairs&lt;/a&gt;, including HDL cholesterol levels and alcohol consumption, as well as neuroticism and self-reported sleeplessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, we looked for a type of gene-environment interaction called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100297"&gt;proportional or joint amplification&lt;/a&gt;. Here, genetic effects grow with increased environmental exposures, and vice versa. This results in a relatively equal balance of genetic and environmental effects on a trait. For example, as self-reported time spent watching television increased, both genetic and environmental variance increased for a person’s waist-to-hip ratio. This likely reflects the influence of other behaviors related to time spent watching television, such as decreased physical exercise. We found &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.01.014"&gt;15 such trait-environment pairs&lt;/a&gt;, including lung capacity and smoking, and glucose levels and alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Environmental factors, such as cigarette smoke and the medications you take, can interact with your genes in unexpected ways.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also looked for cases where biological sex, instead of environmental exposures, influenced interactions with genes. Previous work had shown evidence of these &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-021-00912-0"&gt;gene-by-sex&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100297"&gt;interactions&lt;/a&gt;, and we found additional examples of the effects of biological sex on all three types of gene-environment interactions. For example, we found that neuroticism had genetic effects that varied across sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we also found that multiple types of gene-environment interactions can affect the same trait. For example, the effects of genetics on systolic blood pressure varied by sex, indicating that some genetic variants have different effects in men and women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New gene-environment models&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we make sense of these distinct types of gene-environment interactions? We argue that they can help researchers better understand the underlying biological mechanisms that lead from genetic and environmental risks to disease, and how genetic variation leads to differences in disease risk between people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genes related to the same function work together in a &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Biological-Pathways-Fact-Sheet"&gt;unit called a pathway&lt;/a&gt;. For example, we can say that genes involved in making heme – the component of red blood cells that carries oxygen – are collectively part of the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537329/"&gt;heme synthesis pathway&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting amounts of heme circulating in the body influence other biological processes, including ones that could lead to the development of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/17705-low-hemoglobin"&gt;anemia and cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Our model suggests that environmental exposures modify different parts of these pathways, which may explain why we saw different types of gene-environment interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, these findings could lead to treatments that are more personalized based on a person’s genome. For example, clinicians might one day be able to tell whether someone is more likely to decrease their risk of heart disease by taking weight loss drugs or by exercising.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our results show how studying gene-environment interactions can tell researchers not only about which genetic and environmental factors increase your risk of disease, but also what goes wrong in the body where.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2025/03/27/JNEUROSCI.2237-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has mapped the neural activity underlying lucid dreams with unprecedented precision. The researchers found that lucid dreaming produces a unique pattern of brain activity that includes altered communication between brain regions, increased gamma activity, and signatures linked to self-awareness and cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucid dreaming occurs when a person becomes aware that they are dreaming, sometimes even gaining control over the dream’s content. Though vivid and immersive, this state is neurologically complex and still poorly understood. Previous studies had proposed possible brain markers of lucid dreaming, but results were often inconsistent. Many used small samples and lacked standardized methods to clean up confounding signals such as those produced by eye movements during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The team led by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C3%A7a%C4%9Fatay-demirel-93bb50b6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Çağatay Demirel&lt;/a&gt; at Radboud University Medical Center sought to overcome these limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am a PhD candidate nearing completion, and this project represents the largest chapter of my dissertation,” Demirel explained. “Lucid dreaming felt like a strange crack in reality—a moment where you could witness your mind from within and perhaps even take control, even when nothing else felt truly graspable. That paradox—being awake inside a dream—captivated me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over time, that existential curiosity evolved into a scientific pursuit. Moreover, the inconclusive results regarding electrophysiological correlates in several studies using distinct, small-sample EEG datasets highlighted the need for refinement in the field—specifically, through an EEG mega-analysis by combining various datasets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers assembled a large dataset from multiple laboratories in the Netherlands, Germany, Brazil, and the United States, bringing together a final sample of 26 lucid dreamers who contributed a total of 43 usable sleep recordings. These included both low-density and high-density EEG recordings, with up to 128 electrodes monitoring electrical activity across the scalp. Participants were instructed to perform a distinct sequence of eye movements (left-right-left-right) once they realized they were dreaming. This standard signal allowed the researchers to pinpoint the moment lucidity began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major innovation in the study was the development of a multi-stage preprocessing pipeline to clean the EEG data. This was essential because both spontaneous and voluntary eye movements during REM sleep can introduce artifacts that mimic brain activity, especially in the gamma frequency band (30–45 Hz). The team implemented techniques to identify and remove these saccadic artifacts using signal processing methods that worked even on low-density EEG setups. This preprocessing ensured that the signals analyzed truly reflected neural activity and not muscle movements or other noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then compared brain activity during lucid REM sleep to that during regular REM sleep and relaxed wakefulness. These comparisons used both broad frequency band analyses and more advanced techniques that measured brain signal complexity and functional connectivity. They found that lucid dreaming had a distinctive neural profile. While some features overlapped with normal REM sleep, such as lower alpha power and higher delta activity compared to waking, other features set lucid dreams apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key finding was a reduction in theta and beta power in certain brain regions during lucid dreams, particularly in the posterior and right temporoparietal regions of the brain. These areas are involved in attention and self-awareness, suggesting that lucid dreaming might engage neural circuits similar to those used during reflective or metacognitive thinking. At the same time, the researchers observed increased gamma activity—especially in the 30–36 Hz range—around the moment the lucid dreamer became aware. This activity was most pronounced in the precuneus and prefrontal cortex, areas linked to consciousness and internal monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional connectivity analyses revealed that lucid dreaming was associated with greater long-range communication between brain regions, particularly in the alpha and gamma bands. These patterns involved areas of the brain known to support sensory integration, internal attention, and memory—functions likely involved in recognizing and maintaining lucidity within the dream. Notably, alpha connectivity during lucid dreams formed a network that included the superior temporal and superior frontal gyri, suggesting coordination between auditory, sensory, and executive systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signal complexity analyses also distinguished lucid dreams from other sleep states. Measures like Lempel-Ziv complexity and entropy, which quantify the unpredictability or richness of brain signals, were higher in lucid dreaming than in regular REM sleep. However, these values were still lower than in the waking state. This suggests that lucid dreaming represents an intermediate state of consciousness—one that is more organized and self-aware than typical dreaming, but still distinct from being awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t approach with any specific expectations (there is no null hypothesis in this project), as this is an almost entirely exploratory study due to the merging of large datasets from different labs,” Demirel told PsyPost. “However, the findings that captivated us most were in the source-level analyses (cortical estimation), which differ from the more traditional sensor-level EEG analyses we also applied. Sensor-level EEG patterns during lucid dreaming regarding power spectral density (PSD) analyses resemble REM sleep in statistical sense. However, source-level findings revealed heightened alpha connectivity during lucid dreaming that lies between REM sleep and wakefulness (there are evidences in the literature regarding alpha connectivity changes related to psychedelics).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also studied how brain activity changed in the moments before and after lucid dreamers signaled their awareness with eye movements. In the seconds surrounding this signal, gamma activity spiked, and large-scale increases in connectivity were seen across the cortex. These changes began just before the eye movement signal, suggesting that the brain prepares for lucidity even before the dreamer communicates it. These moments may capture the emergence of self-awareness from a non-conscious dream state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The gamma activation in the precuneus around the onset of lucidity eye signaling was quite a surprising finding,” Demirel said. “Considering that this activation occurs in comparison to a baseline temporally close to the onset itself, it provides potentially conclusive patterns suggesting that the brain may simulate its own reality, reflecting self-referential awareness and possibly motor awareness. This could be interpreted as a potential sensory awakening into a simulated reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study sheds light on the neural mechanisms behind lucid dreaming by addressing previous methodological challenges and using both sensor-level and source-level analyses. The findings show that lucid dreaming is not simply a hybrid of dreaming and waking, but a distinct state of consciousness with its own brain dynamics. By tracking both spectral activity and functional connectivity, the researchers provide a more complete picture of how the brain supports self-awareness within a dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still several open questions. Lucid dreaming remains difficult to induce in experimental settings, which means that researchers often rely on naturally occurring instances. Dream content also varies widely between participants and sessions, making it harder to isolate what aspects of the experience are most responsible for the observed brain patterns. The study also relied on EEG, which has limited spatial resolution and cannot definitively rule out the influence of residual artifacts—especially in high-frequency bands where eye movements are most disruptive. Future studies using methods like fMRI or intracranial recordings could help resolve these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rarity of very high-density EEG combined with fMRI data—or the lack of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data—on lucid dreaming poses a major limitation for performing volumetric estimations of deep brain structures,” Demirel said. “While interesting patterns can be captured at the source level, we had to restrict our analyses to cortical estimations. Although we can detect the onset of lucid dreaming through eye signaling via electrooculogram (EOG), the actual experience likely begins earlier, and we still don’t know exactly when lucidity truly emerges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The limitations are shaping the goals. I am working on the development of more in-depth mathematical models to decode EEG patterns and improve sensitivity to phase shifts in non-stationary state decoding. Considering that lucid dreaming is seemingly a transient brain state, methodological reconsideration is essential to distinguish it from stationary signals. This could enable a more precise segmentation of the lucid state. I also view lucid dreaming as a tool for developing methods that could ultimately help redefine the dynamics of sleep and wakefulness, which will also indirectly support research into disorders of consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m just happy that the study has finally been published after years of very draining work that, at times, felt like it would never end,” Demirel added. “I’m really excited to finally share these findings with the community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2237-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Electrophysiological correlates of lucid dreaming: sensor and source level signatures&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Çağatay Demirel, Jarrod Gott, Kristoffer Appel, Katharina Lüth, Christian Fischer, Cecilia Raffaelli, Britta Westner, Xinlin Wang, Zsófia Zavecz, Axel Steiger, Daniel Erlacher, Stephen LaBerge, Sérgio Mota-Rolim, Sidarta Ribeiro, Marcel Zeising, Nico Adelhöfer, and Martin Dresler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 12:15:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOWkxrWFJ4N2t5ZkV5WkJ2dDRkSVVJQVVRZ0t2cTYwT1I0OE9zZWk3a2NhVTlZd1BaczdYSXhhUEJWSXIzT0FjWURRV2daQ0tRNXVjTnNWWF9ibDlhYThkbGJid3pZWjM1QnlFMXFkamtsdUlIUXdVZjU0aHRkc3R5QUtlQWQ1R192TnB6LTMySC1CVl9aNG94WVBn</guid></item><item><title>他在56小时的手术中接受了别人的脸的礼物。接下来发生的事情很复杂-《独立报》 | He received the gift of someone else’s face in a 56-hour surgery.

It was the duration: the surgery had taken 56 hours — far longer than he’d expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We talked about 36 hours,” he recalls, “so I was shocked.” He couldn’t imagine the drama that had played out in the operating room while surgeons worked against the clock to remove his existing deformities and then transfer another man’s face onto his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandness had trained for years for this moment, lifting weights and doing dips and cardio so that his body would be strong enough to undergo such an extensive surgery. And yet, it would be months before he had the strength to hold a conversation without tiring, years before he felt at home in his own skin. The complications that had arisen during his operation were nail-biting. The plastic surgeon who led the operation, Dr. Samir Mardini, had tried to take a short break during those 56 hours that Andy was under, but with the adrenaline pumping and the scenes running through his mind, he found that he couldn’t switch off — so he went straight back down to theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandness, now in his late thirties, remains one of only a few people in the world to have received a full face transplant. In 2006, at age 21, he attempted to take his own life with a rifle shot to the face. He survived, barely. The damage was devastating. For a decade he lived with a face that had been reconstructed, piece by piece, in a series of surgeries — functional, but far from natural. Children would point at him in the street or ask their parents what they were looking at. Adults would widen their eyes then quickly look away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 eeQqqU"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/56/23_FaceInTheMirror.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/56/23_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/56/23_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Andy Sandness (right, with Dr Samir Mardini who led the 56-hour surgery) has married and had children since the face transplant.

That milestone belongs to Isabelle Dinoire, a French woman mauled by her dog in 2005. But Sandness’s surgery, performed in 2016 at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, marked a quiet milestone in the American history of facial transplantation: a pivot from possibility to permanence. It was a test case not just of surgical technique, but of ethics, identity, and time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mardini says the team trained for over three years before they even had a recipient. Fifty weekends were spent in the cadaver lab with doctors, nurses and even medical photographers, painstakingly transferring the faces of dead people onto the bones of others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as they prepared, they didn’t know if their efforts would come to anything. A face is not like a singular organ, where the tissue is all the same and the major veins and arteries are obvious. A face has skin; muscular tissue; parts of bone; tiny blood vessels; nerve pathways crucial for touch, sight, and the ability to swallow and eat. Eyelids, nostrils and lips come in certain sizes. Hairlines have to match up. Skin color and tone needs to be close to the recipient’s. All of these factors mean that finding a match on the donor list is close to impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, not far away in rural Minnesota, 21-year-old Rudy Ross compulsively took his life in earshot of his wife, Lilly, following an argument. Lilly called an ambulance immediately, but it was clear that Rudy could not be saved. What made Rudy’s death so tragic is abundantly clear — he was young and healthy, with his whole life ahead of him and no history of major disease — but it’s also what made him an ideal candidate for organ donation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Race Against Two Clocks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time Rudy Ross’s body arrived at Mayo Clinic, everything was in motion. Gravely sick people who had been waiting at the top of the transplant list across the country were told that the organ they needed was on the way. In these kinds of situations, a kidney can be headed to Alaska while a liver is earmarked for Texas and a heart is needed in Pennsylvania. Each hospital sends a team to take the organ back to their waiting recipient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you add face transplantation into this mix, things get complicated. Rudy’s wife had been suddenly widowed. She was eight months’ pregnant. And while Rudy had agreed to donate his internal organs by ticking the requisite boxes on his drivers’ license, his face had never been promised. That had to be negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The families who “might be approached by the organ procurement organization to talk about the face” are usually those who already know their loved one wanted their internal organs to be given, says Dr. Mardini. “So there’s already a sort of open discussion… Your loved one has signed off on their drivers’ license that they would like to give the gift of heart donation, lung donation, kidney donation — but we have a patient at Mayo Clinic that is in need of a face. Is this something you would consider?” That topic is introduced only if the donor is a clear match, which was clearly the case for Rudy and Andy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I got chills,” says Dr. Mardini, recalling how he felt when he saw Rudy’s face. The two men “could have been cousins.” After a difficult period of reflection, Lilly agreed that her late husband’s face, as well as his internal organs, could be taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 IDsGF"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/39/10_FaceInTheMirror.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/39/10_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/39/10_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Two side-by-side operating theaters were set up over the weekend for the face donation and transplantation.

The two men were placed in side-by-side operating theaters — Rudy, braindead but stabilized, and Andy, anesthetized and closely watched — and Mardini carefully removed Rudy’s face before running it into the adjoining theater and attaching it to Andy’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carefully removing all of the tissue surrounding the face is delicate. And preparing the recipient to receive all those veins, nerves and muscles is a procedure in itself, one that borders on the horrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Andy’s was a significant surgery in that it involved the entire upper jaw, lower jaw, the cheekbones, the mandible and the nose and teeth and all the overlying structures,” says Mardini. “So you're talking about the nose and then lower eyelid and below, and then deep from the skin all the way down to the bone. You need to remove everything that's remaining there. That's to accommodate the donor to come in. So you're at the end of it, and you're staring at the greater vessels, the carotid and the jugular. You're staring at the tongue and the eyeballs, and everything else is gone.” It’s something that he and the rest of the team had to prepare for, not just in terms of “the technical part, but the emotional and mental part.” No one is used to seeing a living human without a face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that all this work has to be done to remove the underlying tissues also means that the operation is extremely high-pressured. There’s no going back in a face transplant, no putting the old organ back in and trying again next week with something else. Failure is quite simply catastrophic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack El Hai is an author who spent five years with Andy Sandness and his medical team, and was in the operating theater as the pioneering surgery was performed. He got to know the process intimately and interviewed multiple members of the medical team as it had happened. He remembers a moment where things got particularly tense in the operating room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was a moment in the placement of the donor's face onto Andy when an important blood vessel narrowed or collapsed or went into spasms,” he says. “And it took a long time — or it seemed like forever, it was probably just a matter of minutes — but it took a while for the surgical team to figure out what was going on and why, and how to fix it. They noticed that while that blood vessel was constricting, Andy's face went white. It was obvious it wasn't getting proper blood flow. And that had to be fixed immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the team struggled to work out what was happening, El Hai felt the mood in the room shift. Andy’s old, reconstructed face had been cut away. There wasn’t really a Plan B, beyond “a gaping opening in his face that somehow would've had to be patched using skin from other parts of his body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Painful Priorities&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another issue with taking a face from a donor who also has healthy organs that are waiting to be procured for other people in dire health situations: “The way it works best is to have the face donation go first,” says Dr. Mardini. “And that makes it very tricky, because you're dealing with a ‘life-giving’ operation versus a ‘life-saving’ operation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, only around 50 face transplants have ever been performed. The rarity isn’t due to a lack of demand. Patients with devastating facial injuries — most often from trauma, cancer, or infection — face profound physical and social barriers. A functioning face is not just about appearance; it governs speech, eating, blinking, and expressing emotion. Traditional reconstructive surgery can require dozens of procedures and still fall short of restoring those functions. A transplant offers, in some cases, a faster route to a more complete face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the barriers are steep. These operations require staggering surgical precision: connecting those nerves, blood vessels, and bone with millimeter-level accuracy. Then there’s the immunological gauntlet. Patients must commit to a lifetime of immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection — medications that can cause serious side effects, from kidney damage to cancer. Isabelle Dinoire died of a cancer related to low immunity 11 years after her own partial face transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayo’s team had to prove to the organ procurement organization — and to their peers — that their procedure wasn’t a vanity project. It was an operation that could restore breathing, eating, speaking, the ability for a person to live a normal life. It was reconstructive and transformative, not simply cosmetic. Still, the optics were fragile. There was no precedence in the U.S. for prioritizing a face over a lung. And the team also had to convince their own hospital that Andy Sandness, a man who had previously attempted suicide, would work hard to make the transplant worth it, complying with a regimen of immunosuppressant drugs throughout his life and continuing the work he’d put in for years previously. That meant psychiatric assessments and social workers on top of all the other medical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different organs have different rates of depreciation, but all have a small amount of time when they remain viable after death. Keeping Rudy Ross stable enough that those other organs stayed healthy was a huge undertaking in itself. Ordinarily, the heart and lungs need to be taken within four to six hours of death, the liver within eight to twelve, and the kidneys within 24 to 36, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.donoralliance.org/newsroom/donation-essentials/what-is-the-time-frame-for-transplanting-organs/"&gt;according to the nonprofit Donor Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing the face from Rudy “took longer, I think, than [Mardini] expected, more than 20 hours,” says Jack El Hai, “meaning there were other surgeons waiting in the wings to remove the other organs that the donor had given permission for them to take, and it got tense. They were getting impatient. They were worried about the health of those organs that they were waiting for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 efPIYE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/45/17_FaceInTheMirror.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/45/17_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/45/17_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="When Andy woke from the surgery, he didn't have functionality in his new face.

He had also assembled an in-house team to remove the organs immediately if Rudy Ross destabilized, who were ready to step in at a second’s notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the surgery was long and delicate, it worked out in the end. Rudy’s organs went on to save the lives of a number of desperate people, something that was especially important to his widow, Lilly. The details surrounding exactly how many organs were taken have not been released, to protect the privacy of the patients who received them. However, we do know that no organ was compromised by the face transplantation going ahead. That, in itself, is close to a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s Left Behind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miracles in medicine are earned, not bestowed. And Mardini’s team had worked hard to earn theirs: during their weekends in the cadaver lab, they had transferred the biggest possible face onto the smallest possible skull and vice versa; they did CAT scans and drew complex plans of bone and blood vessels in the way an architectural team might put together plans of concrete structures and plumbing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new story began for Andy Sandness when he woke up with Rudy Ross’s face. But first, Ross’s story had to come to a dignified close. Four years earlier, an expert team in developing silicone facial prosthetics had agreed to come down to the cadaver lab sessions and learn how to construct a mask of an entire face. The team had previously made lifelike prosthetic noses, eyes and ears for people with deformities or serious injuries; in the lab, they molded masks that were indistinguishable from the original faces, “with the freckles and the wrinkles and the hair,” says Mardini. Once Rudy Ross’s body arrived at the clinic, they were called in to do the job they’d trained for over a number of years. Fourteen delicate layers of material were carefully woven together and shaped, in order that his body could return to the funeral home looking recognizable, in a process that took 14 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly Ross had planned for a closed casket funeral after she’d agreed to her husband’s face to be transplanted onto Andy Sandness. But when the Mayo Clinic released Rudy’s body, complete with silicone mask, Mardini says they received a call from the funeral director: “He kind of paused then said: ‘I think you sent me the wrong body, because there was going to be a face donation’. And when it turned out it wasn’t the wrong body, he called up the wife and the mom and said: ‘You might want to come and visit with the body’. And they did an open casket.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Looking Like Yourself, As Someone Else&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he has Rudy Ross’s face, Andy Sandness doesn’t look like his donor. That’s because one’s underlying bone structure is just as important for how a person’s face looks as the individual components. That was a relief for Rudy’s widow Lilly — who met with Andy a few times, although they eventually lost touch as they both moved on and had further families — and for Rudy’s mother, who Andy stayed in touch with until her death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Andy is one of the rare people in human existence who has had three faces during his life,” says Jack El Hai. “The one he was born with, the reconstructed face, and then the transplanted face.” Such huge aesthetic changes can be a shock to the system, and psychological issues with carrying someone else’s face or limbs have led to people requesting removal in the past. “So the social workers and the psychologists led him through what they called a gradual reveal,” El Hai continues, “which meant seeing pieces, portions of his face in the mirror, a bit at a time, gradually, from a distance and up close. And this helped Andy become reconciled to his new appearance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 bNCEqj"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/50/18_FaceInTheMirror.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/50/18_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/12/17/50/18_FaceInTheMirror.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="As it became clear that the face transplant had been a successful, joyous scenes and media attention played out while Andy was in recovery at the Mayo Clinic" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-17996"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;As it became clear that the face transplant had been a successful, joyous scenes and media attention played out while Andy was in recovery at the Mayo Clinic&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Courtesy of Mayo Press)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In El Hai’s opinion, Andy — who he describes as a thoughtful and quiet man who came out of his shell after the face transplant — “looks great” these days. “I always tell people that I think he looks like Matt Damon,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandness remains a private man, however, who prefers to do media interviews over email rather than in person or over the phone. Eight years after the surgery, functionality, he says, is good. He’s legally blind in his left eye but has some peripheral vision. “My nerves and feeling in my face improve daily,” he says. “But there is more I could do as far as exercises to improve what I have.” His progress has been steady but incremental, often invisible to outsiders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internal work has required just as much effort as the external. When I ask him what’s overlooked about his experience, he says it’s a “complicated” question, because at first he thought he should mention the time and dedication from everyone involved that goes into a face transplant. “But the more I think about it, it’s definitely not repeating suicide to my friends, family, and doctors,” he says. When he woke up after attempting to take his own life, “I was embarrassed, humiliated, and depressed.” Over the years, he’s accrued a whole team “of psychiatrists, psychologists, and family and friends that all believed in me,” and that’s been humbling. He keeps in mind that he would never want to let them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have a hard shell but a big heart,” he continues. “I will go out of my way to help people out. But I will never ask for help in return, even when I know I need it. I’m stubborn as a mule and do things how I see fit.” It’s a mentality that may have led him to suicidality when he was younger. But it’s also a mentality that he believes helped him pre-transplant: he kept going, even in circumstances many would have found unbearable. Asked if he’s an organ donor himself, he replies simply: “Of course I am.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mardini never thought he’d perform such a complex operation as a plastic surgeon. But the change in Andy Sandness’s life is clear: “He is able to swim. He is able to eat and drink in a restaurant. He is able to interact normally with people,” he says. Recently, Andy described a quiet moment that signaled, to Mardini, that he and his medical team had achieved everything they’d wanted to when they first set out, years prior, to perform the pioneering transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When he walked in an elevator, this kid and his mom walked in after him,” Mardini recalls. “The kid looked at him, looked away and kept talking to his mom. And everything was fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jack El Hai’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFace-Transplant-Medical-Restored-Identity-ebook%2Fdp%2FB0C9TPLY32&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Face in The Mirror&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is published on May 20th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are based in the U.S. and you or someone you know needs mental health assistance right now, call the National Suicide Prevention Helpline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

            Tim Andrews knew that he needed dialysis to manage his end-stage kidney disease, but over months of treatment, he started to wonder whether it was worth it. He was exhausted and hopeless. He missed his grandkids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanew0gx00013b6n9gdwor07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It kept him alive, but it didn’t feel like living.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00043b6m3t98ittx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Desperate for another option, he found a surprising alternative: an organ from a pig.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00053b6mz8gxb2yd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews, 67, is a pioneer of a new kind of medicine. In January, he had an &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/07/health/pig-kidney-transplant-clinical-trials/index.html"&gt;experimental cross-species transplant&lt;/a&gt; of a kidney from a genetically modified pig. He is one of only a handful of patients who have undergone the experimental procedure. For now, he’s the lone person in the United States known to be living with a pig kidney.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00073b6m67359izc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews knew that there was a risk to trying something so new, but if the kidney gave him just one more day free from dialysis, it was worth it — for him and for fellow patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00083b6m8foh7j82@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This will do something for humanity,” Andrews said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000a3b6m2szf47wh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews had been living with diabetes since the 1990s, managing the condition with insulin. About 2½ years ago, he went to the doctor feeling unusually tired. Tests showed that he had stage 3 kidney failure — his kidneys were still working but less efficiently than they should. He was relieved to learn that it was manageable with medication, monitoring and lifestyle changes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000b3b6msczywxmk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But about a month later, a doctor delivered more bad news: Andrews’ kidney disease had rapidly progressed to end-stage disease. Dialysis was the only option to keep him alive until he could get an organ transplant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000c3b6m38wqpa0p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dialysis is highly effective at cleaning the blood, but it places a “huge burden” on the body, Andrews’ doctors told CNN. At first, Andrews thought it was going well. But about six months in, he had a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/702274#:~:text=Bethesda%2C%20MD%E2%80%94Patients%20with%20advanced%20kidney%20disease%20who,removed%20by%20hemodialysis%2C%20increase%20heart%20attack%20risk." target="_blank"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; attack.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000d3b6mw8zvtcrx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It takes a toll on you, emotionally and physically,” said Andrews, who lives in New Hampshire.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000e3b6mgr7h4b0n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He was tempted to forgo dialysis entirely until a doctor warned that if he did so, he should “pick a box.” With the state his kidneys were in, his body would be in it within a couple months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000f3b6m4t6h8t12@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For six hours, three days a week, he kept at it. On days off, he’d sleep. By the time he woke up, he’d have to start the process all over again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000g3b6mwxew95am@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When he thinks about his experience with dialysis, Andrews appreciates what the doctors and nurses did to keep him alive. But when he kept having to sit in that oversized green chair hooked up to the dialysis machine, the whole situation hurt his spirit, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000h3b6mqg2kdxnw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He was too tired to walk or get groceries. He couldn’t eat. Even in the few hours he felt OK, his immune system was so weak that he had to avoid crowds. Dialysis meant no more Red Sox games, no more fun with grandchildren, no more travel.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000i3b6mg61t1v83@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As the hours ticked past, he couldn’t think about gratitude. All he could think about was death.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000j3b6mol95kpqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The dialysis side effects got so bad that he wanted to quit, but his wife, Karen, wouldn’t let him. He also kept hearing his father’s voice in his mind, telling him to stop complaining and start doing something about his situation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000m3b6muwm2xh6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews learned that his odds of getting a human kidney donation were not good.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000n3b6m34na9r5l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://unos.org/news/90000-people-are-waiting-for-a-kidney-heres-one-way-to-get-them-a-kidney-faster/#:~:text=Dialysis%20is%20a%20lifesaving%20treatment,day%20waiting%20for%20a%20kidney." target="_blank"&gt;Nearly 90,0000 people&lt;/a&gt; are on the waiting list for a kidney in the US. Most don’t get a transplant because they become too sick or die while waiting for a match.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000o3b6m5xzxsd14@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews’ chances were slimmer than most because of his rare blood type. People typically wait about three to five years for a donor kidney. For him, it would likely be seven to 10 years. Doctors thought his body could take only five years of dialysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000q3b6mfmcv3szq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was a little short there,” Andrews said. “I know what end-stage means.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000r3b6mfbnmk5j1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But his research gave him hope. Massachusetts General Hospital was also investigating animal alternatives. He demanded that the hospital liaison put him in touch with one of the doctors from that project: Dr. Leonardo Riella, medical director of kidney transplantation at Mass General.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000s3b6mu1migh6k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When they first met, Andrews was “very frail,” Riella said. He arrived in a wheelchair. But when Riella mentioned what’s known as xenotransplantation — transplants using genetically modified pig organs — Andrews’ eyes “sparked.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000t3b6mx21pyge9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He said ‘Tell me what I need to do.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000v3b6m5rc5oniq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Riella told Andrews he’d need to get a lot stronger if he wanted a transplant of any kind.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000w3b6m4t7f8xht@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They said, ‘Prepare your body for battle,’ ” Andrews’ wife, Karen, remembered.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000x3b6mu0w9aobo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the next few months, Andrews went to the gym and physical therapy, got his teeth fixed, got several vaccines and lost 22 pounds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy000y3b6m09f5bksv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When he went back to the clinic a few months later, Riella said, Andrews was “almost running around the room.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmandkmvj00003b6mb5p39kcw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He talked to people about the procedure. He prayed. His wife, Karen, also had to agree: If they got the green light, she would need to sign consent papers. On the slim chance he got a virus from the organ, she’d be exposed to it, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00123b6mnbvk30gw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was a little taken aback by that,” Karen said. But she didn’t have any doubt that this transplant, though unusual, was the right way to go.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00133b6muz8yae08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It has to be better than dialysis,” she said. “He was just feeling so awful all the time.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00153b6mz6vnmfzj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In January, it was finally time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00163b6mfrop1fya@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On surgery day, his family hugged and kissed him good-bye. Karen gave him a high-five and wished him luck.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00173b6mgehl3q19@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The procedure was supposed to take four hours, but only about two hours and 15 minutes in, Karen said, her phone rang. The doctors were done early and said it went “unbelievably well.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00193b6mo8eeynjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001a3b6mjtm5s3vm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They put the kidney on the table and started connecting him to the kidney, and he actually peed across the room,” Karen said, laughing. Everyone in the operating room started cheering.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001b3b6m99wl94rr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Of course, I started bawling like a baby,” Karen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001c3b6m4mwjjubb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It all happened so fast that even the doctors who did the surgery were surprised.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001d3b6m8qa25yiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It worked right away, and the numbers started getting better,” Riella said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001e3b6ml5hfezgj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After waking up from surgery, Andrews felt &lt;a href="https://www.aha.org/role-hospitals-massachusetts-general-hospital-team-performs-second-xenotransplant-genetically-edited-pig-kidney-living" target="_blank"&gt;“reenergized and revitalized.”&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001f3b6m6fmfrbwe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was alive, and I hadn’t been in a long time,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001g3b6m8bk9xgag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He hopped off the bed and tap-danced across the room, he said. His mind felt clear.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001h3b6mvrcka5bt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was a miracle,” Andrews said. So much so, he declared that he had a new birthday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001i3b6ml4vkhpun@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I said ‘look at me, it’s like I’m like a new man,’ ” he said. “It’s like new birth. I said, ‘I’ve got a new birthday. 1/25/25 is my new birthday.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001j3b6mmt7enzkw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the transplant, Andrews spent a week in the hospital but only out of an abundance of caution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001k3b6mci843jr2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the months since, he’s had a few “small bumps in the road,” including a three-week hospital stay. But the pig kidney does what a kidney from a living human donor would do.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001l3b6mnq7xe1gu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Life is returning to normal. Andrews cooks, vacuums and takes long walks with his dog, Cupcake.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001m3b6m2y5z915d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He currently takes more than 50 pills every day as the doctors try to figure out the type of medications he’ll need with his new kidney. But living without dialysis has made such a difference.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001n3b6ms5wxs3lh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Basically, I was just sleeping, sick all the time. Now I can do anything I want,” Andrews said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001o3b6m128588nc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He even lets himself picture a future. He can’t wait to see his grandkids again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001p3b6mbo87vneu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They saw me at the lowest, and now they’ll be able to see me alive and laughing and carrying on like Grandpa does,” Andrews said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001q3b6mkdjn1eid@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If all goes well, he hopes to take Karen to Europe in a year. He said they’ve put it off far too long.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaned9de000z3b6m35ut0cwz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, Andrews knows that the pig kidney may not work long-term. He’s still on the wait list for a human organ. If the pig kidney can act as a bridge that keeps him healthy enough to wait for a match from a human donor, that would be a medical first — and a success.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001w3b6mvyb5rfej@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews is the fourth living patient in the US to get a genetically modified pig kidney transplant, and he won’t be the last. In addition to the ongoing trial at Mass General in conjunction with biotech firm eGenesis, &lt;a href="https://ir.unither.com/press-releases/2025/02-03-2025-120011819" target="_blank"&gt;United Therapeutics Corp&lt;/a&gt; – the other main biotech company helping create the pig kidneys – announced in February that it would be allowed to start its own clinical trials with New York University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanv2g6f00033b6nzvnkrz0b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2412747" target="_blank"&gt;March 2024&lt;/a&gt;, Richard Slayman became the first living patient in the world to get a genetically modified pig kidney. The &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/04/health/pig-kidney-transplant-patient-home/index.html"&gt;operation&lt;/a&gt; at Mass General went well, but he died two months later from causes not related to the transplant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001y3b6mgnzd3kb2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors said they learned a lot from their experience with Slayman. He had scarring on his heart after eight years of dialysis, Riella said, and it’s probably important to get patients like Andrews, who haven’t needed dialysis as long.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmantqqty00003b6nnua2387k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April 2024, Lisa Pisano became the first person to receive a mechanical heart pump as well as a gene-edited pig kidney. The organ failed due to limited blood flow and was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/31/health/pig-kidney-transplant-removal/index.html"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; the next month. She died in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/09/health/heart-pump-pig-kidney-transplant-death"&gt;July 2024&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy001z3b6m4mf9tsiz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then, in November 2024, NYU transplanted 53-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/17/health/third-pig-kidney-transplant"&gt;Towana Looney&lt;/a&gt; with a genetically modified pig kidney. It functioned for four months and nine days, the longest yet, but doctors had to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/health/pig-kidney-transplant-removed-longest-in-living-patient/index.html"&gt;remove&lt;/a&gt; it in April when her immune system started to reject it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00203b6m5pb5qb04@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Figuring out how to manage rejection is going to be key, doctors say. The pig kidneys Andrews and Slayman got had 69 genomic edits, while Looney’s had fewer. Doctors say they still don’t know how many edits are necessary, but both versions of the modified pig kidneys had pig genes removed and human genes added to make the organ more compatible with the human body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00213b6mn3jydp5y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients also receive anti-rejection drugs and wearable remote monitoring tools. But doctors still are figuring out how much medicine and monitoring is needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00223b6melm7sxdc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is a learning curve,” Riella said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00233b6mxk6poum0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Riella is hopeful xenotransplantation may one day solve the world’s organ shortage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00243b6mffsi70wv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think patients like Tim will be remembered as heroes,” he said. “Without them willing to take the risk, we wouldn’t be able to move this to the clinic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00253b6m9j2g5psa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Andrews remembers what it felt like to have to make the choice. But he also remembers what it was like to sit for hours at the dialysis center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00263b6mjkv94irk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s hard to come to terms with mortality. You think ‘ah, I can handle that’ and everything, but it’s tough,” he said recently, back in the green chair where he underwent dialysis. “It was very tough to realize that was it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00273b6mndkr1yym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was going to die in this building.”&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00283b6mu67b6cva@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He found a way out. He hopes his story will inspire others to look for hope, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmanb2uyy00293b6mvsmye15u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I see way too many people give up,” Andrews said. “Don’t give up.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Pictured a scan showing how the unnamed man's neck and spine had become deformed &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scans taken by his doctors revealed the vertebrae of his neck had become distorted and dislocated with scar-like tissue developing in the spine over time as a result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medics initially tried to correct his dropped head syndrome with collars— medical devices worn around the neck that support and stabilise the head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, as the patient complained of numbness while wearing the devices, this treatment was stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors instead opted for a series of surgical procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They first removed small segments of his vertebrae and some of the scar-like tissue that had developed in his neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medics then inserted a series of screws and metal rods into the bones of his neck to correct his posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Six months following the surgery the patient was found to be easily able to hold his head in a horizontal position. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man's problems with lifting his head and swallowing had not returned during a follow-up a year later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Medics eventually inserted a series of screws and metal rods into the bones of his neck to correct his posture (left). The results are six months after the procedure (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts concluded that their patient's condition had likely been triggered by a combination of the long term effects of holding his neck in an awkward position while playing games on his phone and an 'underlying developmental disorder'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they urged for increased awareness of the dangers of excessive smartphone usage, paticularly as it is rising among young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772964823000369#fig1"&gt;JOS Case Reports&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, the team said the patient and his family had consented to his case being published. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dropped head syndrome—also known as floppy head syndrome — is characterised by severe weakness of the neck muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most commonly associated with neuromuscular disorders such as motor neurone disease it can be triggered by other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14703851/Man-dropped-head-syndrome-addiction.html"&gt;substance abuse&lt;/a&gt;, with Iranian medics recently detailing a case involving a 23-year-old man who developed the condition after using amphetamine for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shandong researchers suggest that edible and medicinal fungi contain bioactive components with therapeutic potential for central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Findings offer evidence for the potential of these fungi to serve as novel pharmaceuticals or functional foods in the treatment of CNS diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Central nervous system (CNS) diseases involve complex pathophysiology, gradual symptom onset, and significant challenges in therapeutic evaluation. Aging populations and increasing life and work stress have contributed to a rising incidence of conditions such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy, and depression, which are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmacological development in CNS diseases remains limited, with existing treatments that do not halt disease evolution but only relieve symptoms. Adverse effects and incomplete mechanistic understanding further complicate drug discovery efforts in this area, resulting in lower success rates compared to other therapeutic fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edible and medicinal fungi have been utilized in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Certain fungi contain polysaccharides, steroids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and alkaloids with documented antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. Recent studies have examined these &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bioactive+components/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bioactive components&lt;/a&gt; as potential therapeutic agents for CNS diseases, with specific compounds reported to target oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal cell survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "New Dawn of Edible and Medicinal Fungi: Unlocking Central Nervous System Diseases," &lt;a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1750-3841.70230" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Food Science&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a comprehensive literature review of an untold number of previous studies to assess the therapeutic potential of bioactive components in edible and medicinal fungi for CNS diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Studies on Ganoderma lucidum, Cordyceps militaris, and Hericium erinaceus were reviewed, focusing on reported neuroprotective effects, antioxidant properties, anti-inflammatory activities, and gut-brain axis interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects were reported for bioactive components in Ganoderma lucidum, Cordyceps militaris, Hericium erinaceus, and Antrodia camphorata. Studies on Ganoderma lucidum addressed the role of deacetyl ganoderic acid F in regulating microglial and astrocytic activity. Selenium peptides from Cordyceps militaris were linked to modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress in preclinical models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antrodia camphorata alcohol extracts (AC-AE) were reported to reduce infarct size and increase antioxidant levels in ischemic stroke models. Hericium erinaceus was associated with regulation of monoamine neurotransmitters and anti-inflammatory pathways in studies of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fungi connected to traditional Chinese medicine were found to contain bioactive components that could serve as candidates for the development of pharmaceuticals and functional foods targeting CNS diseases. Neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects suggest potential therapeutic applications in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasize the need for further studies to validate the efficacy of specific compounds, and dosage optimization, under controlled experimental conditions. Standardization of extraction methods and comprehensive safety assessments are recommended to advance the clinical applicability of these fungi-derived bioactive components.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;According to the study authors, "As the global health business continues to grow and human health awareness gradually increases, edible and medicinal fungi are becoming more and more popular due to their special benefits, increasing medicinal value, and steadily rising industrialization level."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As additional context from the ever-skeptical writer of this article with an admitted blindspot for believing supplement health claims (i.e., a medicine cabinet full of unverified mechanisms in edible wish form), the Chinese government continues to promote the strategic integration of the traditional Chinese medicine industry with Western pharmaceuticals under the "Healthy China 2030" initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This policy emphasizes combining traditional Chinese medicine with Western pharmaceuticals as an adjunct treatment for chronic diseases, infectious diseases, and various other health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach this goal, a nationwide traceability system has been established, covering seeds, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/raw+materials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;raw materials&lt;/a&gt;, herbal production, documenting formulations and finished products along with advanced manufacturing and testing facilities to better adhere to Western Good Manufacturing Practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine has put a great deal of support into research with a specific predetermined goal of finding applications for traditional Chinese medicine; essentially, starting with an existing compound, finding its Western therapeutic value, and linking it to a disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While traditional medicinal compounds cultivated for thousands of years will likely be found to contain useful bioactive components, it is just as inevitable that the research pipeline as constructed will include selection or confirmation biases. All research funded within this pipeline will require outside experimental verification, mechanistic understanding and registered clinical trials to confirm the existence of any potential effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study from the &lt;strong&gt;Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)&lt;/strong&gt; has shown that long-term retinal regeneration in mammals is possible. This development holds the potential to restore vision for millions suffering from retinal diseases, a condition that affects over &lt;strong&gt;300 million people&lt;/strong&gt; globally. For years, retinal degeneration, such as that seen in &lt;strong&gt;retinitis pigmentosa&lt;/strong&gt;, has been a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Now, researchers have taken a significant step toward reversing this debilitating condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A breakthrough in retinal regeneration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by scientists at KAIST, has successfully demonstrated the regeneration of retinal cells in mice, a species that shares many biological traits with humans. This study, published in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58290-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, builds on decades of research into the regenerative abilities of animals like zebrafish. Unlike mammals, zebrafish can regrow retinal cells after an injury. However, the challenge for mammals, including humans, is that their central nervous system lacks the capacity for such regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers focused on &lt;strong&gt;Müller glial cells&lt;/strong&gt;, which support retinal neurons. In zebrafish, these cells are able to reprogram themselves into retinal neurons after an injury. Unfortunately, mammals do not possess this regenerative ability. The breakthrough at KAIST involved manipulating a protein called &lt;strong&gt;PROX1&lt;/strong&gt;, which typically prevents the development of new retinal cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;By suppressing PROX1 in mice, the team was able to stimulate the growth of new retinal neurons, effectively bypassing the limitations that have long hindered mammalian retinal regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The role of PROX1 in retinal regeneration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The protein &lt;strong&gt;PROX1&lt;/strong&gt; plays a crucial role in preventing retinal cell regeneration in &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/this-80000-year-old-tool-shouldnt-exist-neanderthals-werent-supposed-to-build-it/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="79904" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mammals&lt;/a&gt;. It had been known that this protein accumulates in &lt;strong&gt;Müller glial cells&lt;/strong&gt; after retinal damage, where it suppresses the development of new retinal cells. Interestingly, this inhibitory process does not occur in zebrafish, which explains their ability to regenerate retinal tissue. By blocking &lt;strong&gt;PROX1&lt;/strong&gt;, the researchers were able to override this suppression in mice, leading to sustained retinal regeneration for &lt;strong&gt;six months&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This long-term regenerative response was a first in the field of mammalian retinal regeneration. The results of this study could have profound implications for treating retinal diseases such as &lt;strong&gt;retinitis pigmentosa&lt;/strong&gt;, where the photoreceptor cells in the retina deteriorate over time, leading to blindness. If this method can be adapted for human use, it would mark a major advancement in regenerative medicine and provide new hope for people affected by these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

(Photo courtesy of KAIST)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Comparing zebrafish and mammalian retinal regeneration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery builds on the remarkable regenerative capabilities of animals like zebrafish, which are able to reprogram their &lt;strong&gt;Müller glial cells&lt;/strong&gt; into functional retinal neurons following injury. Zebrafish and other animals, such as amphibians, have been known to regenerate parts of their central nervous system, including retinal tissue. This ability has made zebrafish a model organism for studying retinal regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, mammals have evolved to lack this regenerative capacity. The difference between these species lies in the molecular pathways that govern tissue regeneration. For years, scientists have been trying to identify which proteins or pathways could be manipulated to trigger similar regenerative processes in mammals. The work at KAIST, which targets &lt;strong&gt;PROX1&lt;/strong&gt;, offers a potential solution to this problem, showing that a simple genetic alteration can lead to the regeneration of retinal neurons in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Moving forward with human applications&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study offers a promising direction for future research into retinal regeneration and vision restoration. Scientists have already begun exploring ways to apply the findings from this study to human retinal diseases. With conditions like &lt;strong&gt;retinitis pigmentosa&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;macular degeneration&lt;/strong&gt; affecting millions, the ability to regenerate retinal cells could provide a revolutionary treatment option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also considering how this technique might be integrated with other advancements in retinal treatment, such as &lt;strong&gt;gene therapy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;stem cell therapies&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;laser-based technologies&lt;/strong&gt;. The progress made in this study is a significant step forward, and it brings hope that one day, it may be possible to regenerate retinal tissue in humans and reverse the effects of blindness caused by retinal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

Delicious, right? Now imagine that same treats doing wonders for your heart by lowering your blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to researchers from the University of Surrey, these tasty treats seem to be more than indulgences – they could help maintain blood pressure and overall cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, recently published in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;, zeroes in on flavan-3-ols – plant compounds found in cocoa, tea, apples, and grapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings? Regular consumption of these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-chocolate-survive-dna-research-may-help-save-cacao-trees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;compounds&lt;/a&gt; may lower blood pressure and improve blood vessel function. Who knew heart health could taste so good?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-everyday-foods-that-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;Everyday foods that lower blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavan-3-ols may sound like something you’d find in a chemistry lab, but they’re actually hiding in your kitchen. These natural compounds are abundant in everyday foods like tea, dark &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chocolate-could-be-the-next-probiotic-powerhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chocolate&lt;/a&gt;, and apples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from 145 randomized controlled trials, and the results were intriguing. People who consumed more flavan-3-ols had lower blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the twist – in some cases, the effects of these compounds were comparable to certain blood pressure medications. Imagine getting a similar result from a cup of tea as you would from a pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-tea-and-chocolate-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;Can tea and chocolate lower blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hot mug of tea, a piece of dark chocolate melting in your mouth  – it sounds too good to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study doesn’t suggest swapping medicine for a snack. But it does raise an interesting point: Certain &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-tea-every-day-proven-studies-to-delay-biological-aging-in-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt; could play a supportive role in managing cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with high blood pressure saw the most significant benefits from flavan-3-ols. The takeaway? The foods you love might just love you back – if you consume them in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefits-beyond-blood-pressure"&gt;Benefits beyond blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure wasn’t the only focus of this study. The researchers also took a closer look at the endothelium – the inner lining of blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of it as the gateway for blood flow. When the endothelium functions well, blood flows smoothly. When it doesn’t, the risk of heart disease rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavan-3-ols seemed to strengthen this crucial lining, even in participants whose blood pressure didn’t budge. That means a square of dark chocolate or a few apple slices could potentially protect your heart in ways you can’t see but your body will feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Christian Heiss, a cardiovascular medicine expert at the &lt;a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Surrey&lt;/a&gt; and the study’s lead author, is cautiously optimistic about the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings are encouraging for those looking for accessible ways to manage their blood pressure and support their heart health through enjoyable dietary changes,” said Professor Heiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Incorporating small amounts of commonly consumed foods like tea, apples, dark chocolate, or cocoa powder into a daily balanced diet could provide beneficial amounts of flavan-3-ols.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tea-and-chocolate-won-t-replace-meds"&gt;Tea and chocolate won’t replace meds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you start piling up chocolate bars or guzzling gallons of tea, there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tea-bags-release-millions-of-plastic-particles-during-brewing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;caveat&lt;/a&gt;. Professor Heiss emphasizes that this study doesn’t give the green light to ditch your prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While not a replacement for prescribed medications or medical advice, including more flavan-3-ol-rich foods in a daily routine could be a valuable addition to a healthy lifestyle, especially for those with higher blood pressure. These are findings that, although promising, require ongoing investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-is-too-much"&gt;How much is too much?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how much flavan-3-ols do you need to see a benefit? The study doesn’t provide a magic number. A cup of tea, a small square of dark chocolate, or a handful of grapes might do the trick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But keep it real – too much of anything can backfire. More chocolate doesn’t mean more health benefits. Balance is everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark chocolate and tea might get all the attention, but other foods are just as rich in flavan-3-ols. Apples, grapes, and even cocoa powder pack a punch. The trick is to incorporate a variety of these foods into your diet – not just the ones that taste like dessert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-research-directions"&gt;Future research directions &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study might open the door, but it doesn’t close the case. The researchers are far from finished – they’re just getting started. They want to keep peeling back the layers, uncovering how flavan-3-ols really work over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will these compounds have the same impact on people with various health conditions? How much is enough to make a difference without overdoing it? And could something as ordinary as a cup of tea or a piece of dark chocolate eventually earn a spot in public health recommendations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions hang in the air, unanswered but compelling. The study may have given us a glimpse, but the full picture is still coming into focus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, every sip, every bite, every moment of mindful indulgence could be another clue in the unfolding story of how simple foods might carry profound possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tea and dark chocolate – not miracle cures, yet far more than mere indulgences. This study reveals how ordinary foods might carry extraordinary benefits for our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/eurjpc/zwaf173/8092214?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 11:35:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNR1JmcmlQeDdOYWpyQi11UTRMSkNnLXIwSWRscnMyNWF6MmxGU21tS2ZmMkNOOXZfTy10TVEwdzZZV25LQWN6b1V5RmZTWEM2alJXSVJfVVNKcFNiZVRWeUcyQ0pzVzVnRlg3M2lwMFItdFhod0FrczZwU3FFUm1fWVQ2NnQ3YVQ0RFI2a0M0SFRvS2Jm</guid></item><item><title>医生警告说，鲜为人知的疼痛类型可能是致命肠癌的最早迹象-因为病例激增-每日邮报 | Little-known type of pain could be earliest sign of deadly bowel cancer, doctor warns - as cases surge in unde - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPYVFYbFBXa1l4a3VqMXZ0VFozRC14MFhWVHFCaVVDV1kwZFdFWnRzdTY1ak5GcEhJUGlTaHlxUVlsRS1veHo0UExuc1Y1RlU1LTJMLWFWODZqbHdFSXh2SVhfMzExMVMyMUhwdElJWmdpWGdMSkpJbm9oeWs1ZW9NNE1aSDJGYThaS0Y3QjRoMkdQWHRmbTExV1FCRkc3M3hrY1NHczZLQllBUdIBrwFBVV95cUxPd2xrdkcxSlZsOUdLV0VlTy1sbHJ5VmI4Tm9xWVNab0g0ZFFhUGFCZFNIVm5FSkE3ZFlyeUpLczYzejVSRHF3N1h4d3hzMmlJc2FJOTI5dmpRNXZuZldDelJjMVR1SE53UmM5V3I5dUxiM0NkX0FtMThkYVFvSFo4VU1RU25BRFdMcTRhbHBSYU1oZ0FuZEp5TjNhLTByMWk2WEVmdW1faUJmLUM0amJr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Salhab warned of the specific symptoms that could be a red flag for colon cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bleeding from the back passage, or blood in the stool, occurs when cancerous tumours bleed into the digestive tract. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other warning signs of the cancer include a lump in the abdomen, bloating and feeling very tired or short of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, bowel cancer can also appear with no symptoms until it has spread to other areas of the body, where it becomes harder to treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as&lt;span&gt; diagnoses of the disease have sky rocketed by 80 per cent in under 50s across the globe within the last 30 years, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;suggests. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, rates of the disease in older age groups, who are statistically more likely to get the disease overall, have either declined or remained stable in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have suggested a host of factors are likely behind the phenomenon — from increased pollution to rising obesity and even invisible particles of plastic in drinking water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genetic factors are also likely to play a role, according to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bmjoncology.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000049"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt;. But diets high in ultra-processed foods, salt and alcohol and low in vitamins and minerals are the main risk factors underling the most common cancers in under-50s. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer, killing almost 17,000 people each year, with the number of young-onset cases continuing to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analysis suggests deaths from bowel cancer overall in the UK are set to rise by 2,5000 a year by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the number of people in the UK diagnosed with the disease will rise by around a tenth in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 Cancer Research UK analysis of 50 countries revealed that England saw the fourth fastest annual rise in the rate of early-onset bowel cancer in the decade to 2017, faster than any other country in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In reality, it’s not that simple. You’ve probably experienced firsthand how some meals fill you up more than others, even if it’s the same amount of food. (Exhibit A: Finding yourself reaching back into the fridge an hour after you had a heaping plate of lo mein.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sometimes, it’s not the nutrient density (or lack thereof) of your meal that can get in the way of satisfying your hunger pangs; it could be the drink you’re pairing your meal with. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=6814ca22e4b07648cc82da6e&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs42255-025-01227-8.epdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="new scientific study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6814ca22e4b07648cc82da6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=6814ca22e4b07648cc82da6e&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs42255-025-01227-8.epdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;new scientific study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, non-caloric sweeteners (often found in diet sodas and other drinks) mess with the brain’s response to hunger and satiety. That means they can make it harder to know when you’re actually full. In fact, they could even make you feel hungrier. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To learn more about how these common types of sweeteners interrupt hunger cues, we talked to the lead study author as well as doctors who specialize in understating hunger and satiety. Especially if you find yourself feeling hungry all the time, their insight can help you understand the key to truly feeling satiated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Non-Caloric Sweeteners Interrupt Hunger Cues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The main reason sugar substitutes like aspartame, sucralose, stevia and erythritol are popular is simple: Unlike sugar, they don’t have any calories. This is why you’ll find them in a lot of diet soda drinks, as well as many other processed foods and drinks labeled as low-calorie or zero-calorie. The problem is that consuming these types of sweeteners confuses the brain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The brain is perceiving that there should be calories coming in, but there isn’t. Since there are no calories coming in, the brain increases appetite for consumption of other calories,” explained &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://directory.campbell.edu/people/nicholas-pennings/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Nicholas Pennings, " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6814ca22e4b07648cc82da6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://directory.campbell.edu/people/nicholas-pennings/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Nicholas Pennings, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;a family medicine and obesity medicine doctor and the Director of Campbell University Health Center. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://renewbariatrics.com/bariatric-surgeons/dr-hector-perez/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Hector Perez, " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6814ca22e4b07648cc82da6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://renewbariatrics.com/bariatric-surgeons/dr-hector-perez/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Hector Perez, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;a bariatric surgeon at Renew Bariatrics, put it this way: “Simply put, it seems like non-caloric sweeteners confuse your brain. You’re programmed to expect some extra calories when you eat something sweet, and non-caloric sweeteners don’t fulfill that expectation. This mismatch stimulates your brain’s hunger signals and you end up eating more than you normally would,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://drkatiepage.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Kathleen Page, " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6814ca22e4b07648cc82da6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://drkatiepage.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Kathleen Page, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;the Director of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://usc-dori.org/about-dori/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="USC Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6814ca22e4b07648cc82da6e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://usc-dori.org/about-dori/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;USC Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and the lead author of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; study, told HuffPost that while artificial sweeteners can confuse hunger cues for everyone, certain people experience it to a greater effect. Her study found that both women and people with obesity had a heightened response to the non-caloric sweetener. She said that the difference between people with obesity and people without obesity was especially pronounced. “People with obesity had a really strong response in the hypothalamus, which is the part of the brain that regulates hunger,” Page said. This means that people with obesity who drink diet soda are more likely to overeat than people without obesity who drink diet soda because their brain is doing a worse job of regulating their hunger pangs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why people with obesity are more greatly impacted is a mystery. “It’s like a chicken or egg situation,” Page said. “It could be a cause or consequence of obesity. We really don’t know.” Perez added to this, saying, “As a bariatric surgeon dealing with chronically obese people, I always stress the fact that being overweight is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to obesity. A lot of bodily functions are affected, and you’re not the same as a person with a healthy weight. This includes your brain and how it responds to food.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Better Understand Your Hunger Cues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whether you are trying to avoid overeating or just want to be able to better understand if you’re truly hungry or not, all three experts recommend avoiding diet sodas and other products with non-caloric sweeteners. If you are trying to lose weight, Pennings told HuffPost he recommends avoiding both sugar and non-caloric sweeteners.

Over time, this helps you rebuild trust in your natural hunger signals and builds healthier habits,” Perez said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sure it’s none of the above? Book an appointment with your health care provider to make sure there isn’t an underlying health condition or side effect of a medication that could be causing your constant hunger. For example, Perez told HuffPost that antidepressants and blood pressure medications can both mess with hunger cues. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With all this in mind, figuring out whether you’re hungry or not is clearly a little more complicated than it seems on the surface. In a perfect world — where everyone eats nutrient-rich foods and nothing artificial, focuses on their meals, gets enough sleep, isn’t stressed out and stays well-hydrated — the brain is great at communicating to you whether you’re hungry or not. But since none of us live in this perfect world, it takes more work to decipher. Minimizing diet sodas is one step in the right direction. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 11:00:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPMGwxSERXZ2s4aF9oLVJ2ZGJhSThsUWlkd0VPYzZLaGpMOVBjS29Vc3pvMnhnLTZaMnBCSWgxTmlmTS1TeS1seUR3a0pyeUJxNk83eDFBQWp6Uk9pSHRFTm00WjhtVURnM0t3N0VoUng1a2VBNXZYSFNHZ0pMLVY0XzJFSDAxcS1CUUxVQUZIZkVLNFc50gGaAUFVX3lxTE9iSVJjeUp5STc1dzJZNks1RmJqb09lTU1JZUFUSHNlQ2x5MTNUR3pqRlUzNVU3RFRFc3p5cG50cXNMWEJyWDBhRG5QWVAxTVJONi1jdW1YYUVpdjJFOFpkR3luMzdOd2l1OVVZVmM3TTlNejdQcXVYZFVrM3dBRlp2dXBSWUVUMWhTTlFMc3RPYVBaRjdPcGRxZ3c</guid></item><item><title>科学家揭示DMT如何通过降低控制能量来改变大脑活动和意识- PsyPost | Scientists reveal how DMT alters brain activity and consciousness by lowering control energy - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNTFdtZkdURVJ0QjFlVjB3OFFzNjAwcG5MN1ZBSTIta0tnWXljMFZCUk9RQkszWE95MFhrTTFIZUJtQ0FTVmY0dTN0bHBmR2hKVmkwWFpITEd0aE92cnlDUUhGQzROV25QeDRhRzVsakxnQjZHZ3Jxd3V3T1R1QVdyVHJsZDdpcHlKZlgxX3o1VUFDR19mcWtZWGYtZXJyR3dCNDgzMUpMdTBwYWhzNlFkTUdOTkZSSk90?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-08078-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; sheds light on how the psychedelic compound DMT changes the brain’s dynamic behavior. Researchers found that DMT reduces the amount of energy the brain needs to switch between different activity states. This reduction in control energy was linked to increased complexity in brain signals and to how intense the psychedelic experience felt to participants. The effects were strongest in brain regions rich in serotonin 2a receptors, which are known to play a key role in the effects of psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DMT, or N,N-dimethyltryptamine, is a powerful psychedelic substance that produces vivid hallucinations and immersive altered states of consciousness. It is found in some plants and is the main psychoactive ingredient in ayahuasca, a ceremonial brew used in some South American spiritual traditions. Unlike other psychedelics like LSD or psilocybin, DMT has a very short duration of action—when injected, its effects come on rapidly and subside within about 20 minutes. This brief but intense experience makes DMT uniquely suited for studies using brain imaging tools like fMRI, which can capture the entire altered state in a single session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current study, researchers sought to understand how DMT changes the way the brain shifts between different states of activity. They were particularly interested in how these changes relate to the serotonin 2a receptor. Previous work has shown that psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin increase the brain’s signal diversity—a measure of how complex and varied brain activity is over time. But this study went further, using a mathematical framework known as network control theory to examine how much effort, or “control energy,” the brain needs to transition from one state to another during the DMT experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always been interested in studying the brain during non-ordinary states of consciousness and DMT’s rapid onset and metabolism provides a powerful approach to do so,” said study author &lt;a href="https://singlesp.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;S. Parker Singleton&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral fellow at the Penn Lifespan Informatics &amp;amp; Neuroimaging Center (PennLINC) at the Perelman School of Medicine at University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 20 participants, 14 of whom were included in the final analysis after removing those with excessive head movement. Each participant underwent two sessions, spaced two weeks apart. In one session, they were given an intravenous injection of DMT; in the other, they received a saline placebo. Functional MRI and EEG recordings were taken during each 28-minute scan. DMT or placebo was injected eight minutes into the scan. In a separate session, participants also rated how intense the drug experience felt every minute on a scale from 0 to 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used network control theory to analyze how much energy was needed for the brain to move from one activity pattern to the next at each time point. They found that DMT consistently lowered this control energy compared to placebo. This suggests that under DMT, the brain more easily transitions between different activity states. This flexibility was not random—it followed a pattern tied to the structure and chemistry of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do you ever wonder what’s going on in the brain when someone is on DMT? Well, so do we,” Singleton told PsyPost. “There’s a lot happening and we’re still working to understand what it all means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the drop in control energy was linked to two key aspects of the psychedelic experience. First, EEG recordings showed that brain signals became more complex under DMT, an effect known as increased signal diversity. This complexity has been proposed as a marker of expanded conscious experience. Second, the participants’ own reports of how intense the DMT experience felt were inversely related to control energy—lower energy requirements were associated with stronger subjective effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These relationships varied across different parts of the brain. When the researchers looked at specific brain networks, they found that control energy dropped most significantly in the visual system, the frontoparietal network, and the default mode network. These networks are often implicated in visual processing, attention, and self-referential thought, and they have been shown in previous studies to be particularly affected by psychedelics. Interestingly, the timing of these effects differed: the frontoparietal and default mode networks showed the greatest changes early in the experience, while the visual network’s changes were more sustained and appeared later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found what I believe to be a pretty convincing arousal (vigilance) effect in the visual cortex during the later stages of the scan,” Singleton said. “We likely would not have caught this without our time-resolved approach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At an even finer level, the researchers looked at individual brain regions to see how changes in control energy corresponded to the local density of serotonin 2a receptors. They used brain maps from previous PET imaging studies to estimate how many of these receptors were present in each region. They found that areas with higher serotonin 2a receptor density tended to show larger drops in control energy during the DMT session. These same regions also showed stronger associations between control energy and both EEG signal diversity and subjective intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure that this connection wasn’t just a coincidence, the researchers ran a dominance analysis comparing several types of serotonin receptors. The serotonin 2a receptor consistently emerged as the most important predictor of how DMT affected brain control energy. This reinforces the idea that DMT’s effects are specifically tied to its action on this particular receptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking the analysis a step further, the team asked whether they could simulate DMT’s effects on brain control energy using only placebo data, receptor maps, and pharmacological modeling. They built a simulation that estimated DMT’s concentration in the brain over time and scaled this by serotonin 2a receptor density across brain regions. Using this model as a guide for where and when DMT would act, they were able to recreate the observed changes in control energy with high accuracy. This approach could open new avenues for predicting how other compounds might affect brain dynamics based on their pharmacological profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study offers a detailed picture of how DMT temporarily shifts the brain into a more fluid and flexible mode of functioning. By requiring less control energy to move between different activity patterns, the brain may be able to explore a broader range of mental states, contributing to the intense and sometimes transformative nature of the psychedelic experience. The close alignment of these changes with serotonin 2a receptor distribution also strengthens the case that this receptor is a key gateway for the altered states produced by psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its insights, the study has limitations. The sample size was relatively small, and individual differences in brain structure were not accounted for, since the researchers used a group-average structural connectome. The design was single-blind rather than double-blind, which might introduce some bias. Also, while the researchers found strong associations at the group level, future studies could explore whether these patterns hold true at the individual level—an important step for personalizing psychedelic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still have a lot to learn about psychedelic action in the brain,” Singleton said. “On-going work seeks to address many potential confounds including influences of arousal, head motion, and these drugs’ ability to impact the tone of blood vessels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08078-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Network control energy reductions under DMT relate to serotonin receptors, signal diversity, and subjective experience&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by S.

Nonetheless, vaccination rates among U.S. children have fallen in recent years, which experts attribute to vaccine skepticism and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of Americans still see the MMR vaccine as safe. Some 86% of respondents in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll said it was safe for children, a marginally higher share than the 84% who said the same in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in May 2020, in the early months of the COVID pandemic. Some 13% of respondents in the latest poll said the vaccine was not safe for kids, up marginally from 10% five years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest poll, which surveyed 1,163 U.S. adults nationwide, had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infectious disease experts worry that comments from Secretary for Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has offered mixed messages about the severity of the disease and the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, may further exacerbate vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the Infectious Diseases Committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said he was encouraged by the high level of confidence in the MMR vaccine given the messaging from the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do feel a bit better knowing that the public is recognizing that a lot of the information they're seeing right now from the administration is not accurate," O'Leary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who became the nation's top health official in February, says he is not opposed to vaccines, which he says are the best way to prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Secretary Kennedy and HHS have deployed thousands of MMR vaccine shots and have repeatedly promoted measles vaccination in media interviews, social media posts, and public statements," White House spokesman Kush Desai said in an email. "HHS is even investing $500 million in an ambitious universal vaccine project under Secretary Kennedy’s leadership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DUTY TO VACCINATE CHILDREN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 76% of respondents in the Reuters/Ipsos poll - including majorities of both Republicans and Democrats - agreed with a statement that it was the duty of all parents to vaccinate their children against measles. One in four Republicans, however, disagreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have been declining in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2019-2020 school year, 95.2% of kindergarteners nationwide completed their two-dose MMR vaccine series, above the 95% threshold needed to protect unvaccinated individuals against the highly contagious disease through herd immunity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles vaccination rates dropped to 92.7% in 2023-2024, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within states, pockets of unvaccinated populations have even lower vaccination rates. In Gaines County, Texas, the epicenter of an outbreak that has infected more than 700 people and killed two unvaccinated children, only 82% of kindergarteners are fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas outbreak has spread to Kansas, Oklahoma and New Mexico, where one adult died from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said most Americans are comfortable with the MMR vaccine, which is reflected in high vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem, he said, is that national vaccination numbers can mask pockets of very low vaccination coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You really have to look at these pockets," Adalja said. "That's what makes us very vulnerable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 55% of respondents in the Reuters/Ipsos poll said they were concerned about measles outbreaks - on par with the number who worried about being laid off from their jobs and well below the 80% who worried about rising inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 32% of respondents in the poll said they thought the current administration would stop the current outbreak and prevent measles from becoming a common illness again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jason Lange in Washington and Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago; Editing by Scott Malone, Stephen Coates and Mark Porter)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 10:04:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxNSFRteE1GVUl2ZDVmeGp5UWZrbjlZSng2d1RYN2lPMkNWdjJ3V2k5ODBOZm0zMG5KalJCMkdEdlJkdk0xWnY0MlhpS2J4NFhvTlFNTWU1QmFNZTYxSUNsX0tRWWozLW1iVW01MTkzUkxHQjB2YW1mZUJGY3NIM0xhTTFPS2VqQQ</guid></item><item><title>患有亨廷顿舞蹈症的Hays女士分享她的故事- Hays Post | Hays woman with Huntington’s disease shares her story - Hays Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE55V3N2MUJ6eDlZMUtxNEN3aFlyMWc5THFSaGpYYlJtem1NNXVYbnhlSFVIdFRvbEF4ZEVWbjRmWHhCVkF4U2JsM2hLMDFlbUZlT3lPTEdhbWt1QkFMWk1HeXJEaXg4RmUzbm1sSFpCUGg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="p-4 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-loose"&gt;&lt;figure class="py-8"&gt;&lt;img class="mx-auto w-full sm:w-full md:w-full" src="https://media.eaglewebservices.com/public/2025/5/1746732832882.jpeg" alt="Amy Baltodano of Hays sitting in the comfort of her home wearing a vest that helps control involuntary movement from her Huntington's disease.

She was officially diagnosed on Nov. 15, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It causes impairment of the ability to function like a normal person. Opening stuff and bottles is really hard for me to do. I need to have my daughter help me," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy also deals with involuntary jerking movements known as chorea, along with anxiety, depression and muscle pain. She remains under the care of her primary doctor and neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy previously underwent speech therapy and now participates in occupational and physical therapy. She also takes medication to manage her symptoms and wears a vest to help control her movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy could not continue working as her symptoms worsened and fatigue set in. Fortunately, she isn’t facing the journey alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My parents are helping out with rent, bills and for my daughter's education," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy is adopted and has no contact with her biological parents, which has made it harder for her to trace the origins of her Huntington’s disease. Since the condition is inherited, the lack of a known family medical history has left many questions unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wishes she had looked for her birth parents, but emphasized that she deeply loves and appreciates her adoptive parents, Allen and Rosalie Schmeidler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Amy's been a trooper. Her dad and I are so proud of her for the way she's handling this," Rosalie said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy received her diagnosis on Allen’s birthday, making the news especially emotional. While the family was initially shocked, they felt relieved to understand what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was shocked but kind of relieved to finally know what was actually wrong," Allen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosalie and Allen said their daily routine now revolves around Amy’s needs. They regularly take her to physical and occupational therapy, and travel to Kansas City every three months for neurology appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy said her 15-year-old daughter, Mia Baltodano, is her greatest source of joy and support, even though discussing the diagnosis with her has been difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She's the best person ever. I love her so much... her and my family have been so supportive," Amy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not knowing her biological family history has created uncertainty about her daughter’s potential risk, as Amy has no way of knowing which side the gene came from. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/huntingtons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356117#:~:text=Overview,changed%20gene%20from%20a%20parent."&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, a child of a parent with Huntington’s has a 50% chance of inheriting the gene that causes the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy is determined to raise awareness about the illness in her free time, especially in a community where the condition is not well known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy said she and her family have begun preparing for the future, including arrangements for Mia's care and planning Amy's funeral as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really depressing for Allen and me," Rosalie said. "You always thought your children would outlive you. She still may, but now we have to think of if we're not here, we have to have everything in place for her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy said, "I really have nothing to lose now, so I'm just trying to live my days to the fullest... and watch a lot of reality TV. I can't get away from those housewives." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosalie said when Amy is in public, people often misunderstand or even mock her involuntary movements, not realizing they are caused by a medical condition. Sometimes, it comes from adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family relies on their faith to navigate through the difficulties. Rosalie said she believes God gave Amy this challenge for a reason and trusts that she has the necessary strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He blessed us with Amy. He knew that she was a warrior who could handle this and be a fighter for this cause," Rosalie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the disease’s symptoms and fatal nature, Amy remains hopeful and focused on helping others identify early signs. She continues to stay alert for her daughter’s future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm nervous for her," Amy said. "At least we'll know if something does happen. We'll know the signs to look for that I didn't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy recommends the &lt;a href="https://hdsa.org/"&gt;Huntington’s Disease Society of America&lt;/a&gt; as a resource for learning more about the condition. She also welcomes questions through her &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/amy.baltodano"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and said she’s happy to respond if she can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family thanks their doctors, therapist, neurologist, HaysMed, Northwest Kansas Area on Aging, and extended family and friends for supporting Amy's journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hays Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 10:02:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE55V3N2MUJ6eDlZMUtxNEN3aFlyMWc5THFSaGpYYlJtem1NNXVYbnhlSFVIdFRvbEF4ZEVWbjRmWHhCVkF4U2JsM2hLMDFlbUZlT3lPTEdhbWt1QkFMWk1HeXJEaXg4RmUzbm1sSFpCUGg</guid></item><item><title>诊断困境：一名妇女在普拉提课程中听到“流行音乐”。她的脊椎漏了。- Live Science | Diagnostic dilemma: A woman heard a 'pop' during pilates class.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 42-year-old woman in the United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;During a reformer pilates class — a type of pilates that incorporates machinery with springs that add resistance — the patient felt a "pop" in the left side of her neck. She developed a headache about an hour later. The pain lessened somewhat when she was lying down. But over the next several days, the headaches worsened, disrupting her daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next:&lt;/strong&gt; The woman visited her primary care physician, who suspected the patient had injured one of her &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21563-trapezius-muscle" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21563-trapezius-muscle" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;trapezius muscles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which move the head, neck and upper back. The doctor prescribed opioid-based painkillers and muscle relaxants, but these provided no relief. Nor did physiotherapy sessions involving neck manipulation. After four weeks of constant and intensifying pain, the woman sought further treatment at a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;When doctors conducted a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/64093-ct-scan.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/64093-ct-scan.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;computed tomography (CT) scan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the woman's head, they found old blood clots on both sides of her brain, located between the surface of the brain and the outermost layer of tissue, known as the dura mater. This suggested there had been some trauma affecting the dura mater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors followed the CT scan with an MRI of the patient's spine. The MRI revealed pools of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the clear fluid that typically surrounds the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/mind/neuroscience" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/mind/neuroscience"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and spinal cord; the CSF had likely leaked from a tear in the dura mater that occurred during the woman's pilates class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leakage and accumulation of CSF can cause headaches that worsen when the person's posture is upright, the hospital physicians wrote &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-1947-8-456" target="_blank" data-url="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-1947-8-456" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in a report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, adding that this case "raises the possibility of pilates being a risk factor for the development of a spontaneous CSF leak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;The MRI had not revealed the location of a dural tear, so the doctors decided to treat the woman with bed rest and caffeinated drinks, rather than surgery. Caffeine is thought to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2744679/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2744679/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;increase the production of CSF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and help promote blood flow in the brain, reducing &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/types-of-headaches" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/types-of-headaches"&gt;&lt;u&gt;headache&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; severity in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-RG8zSUg9Sskwwzy3e4rwkj" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-RG8zSUg9Sskwwzy3e4rwkj slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient's headaches lessened significantly, and she was discharged two weeks after her admission. During a follow-up visit one month later, neuroimaging of the patient's skull and spine appeared normal. Her headaches were gone and no further treatment was required. (&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/patient-information/conditions-treated-a-to-z/cerebrospinal-fluid-leak" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/patient-information/conditions-treated-a-to-z/cerebrospinal-fluid-leak" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In most cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, minor dural tears heal completely on their own.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/csf-leak/symptoms-causes/syc-20522246" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/csf-leak/symptoms-causes/syc-20522246" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Spinal CSF leaks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are typically caused by injuries to the head or spine, though they can also result from spinal surgery or invasive procedures, such as a spinal tap or an epidural. These leaks can be &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16854-cerebrospinal-fluid-csf-leak" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16854-cerebrospinal-fluid-csf-leak" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;challenging to diagnose&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as their symptoms can resemble those of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/the-five-most-common-seasonal-allergies" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/the-five-most-common-seasonal-allergies"&gt;&lt;u&gt;allergies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, migraines or sinus infections. It is therefore unknown how commonly spontaneous CSF leaks might occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other known triggers of CSF leaks include the growth of bone spurs along the spine or connective tissue disorders that weaken tissue layers around the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, "there has been no previous documentation in the literature of 'pilates reformer' classes being associated with a spontaneous spinal CSF leak," the doctors wrote in their case report. "To our knowledge, this is the first case." As such, such an injury would be considered a very, very rare outcome of doing pilates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-RG8zSUg9Sskwwzy3e4rwkj-gCz3LktTkPAITNeNSEyI1qjHDp6Rp8I9" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-RG8zSUg9Sskwwzy3e4rwkj-gCz3LktTkPAITNeNSEyI1qjHDp6Rp8I9 slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical or fitness advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cman79guy001w3b76wt7oi3yq@published"&gt;Last weekend my sister “Laura” babysat my two kids, “Vivianna,” 8, and “Jaden,” 6, while my wife “Kaitlyn” and I went out of town to attend a friend’s wedding. Laura took the kids to the mall, and while they were there, Vivianna made a pretty big request, to make a kind of permanent decision that parents often set rules around.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cman7a9n4002d3b76cbqv0vde@published"&gt;Vivianna asked if she could get her ears pierced. Laura allowed it. When we got home the next day and found out, Kaitlyn hit the roof. I literally had to physically restrain her to keep her from attacking my sister. She says she doesn’t want the kids around Laura ever again and is even looking into suing her! To make matters worse, she has involved nearly the entire family and has made clear that either they are with her or they are the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="154" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cman79gv6001x3b76qpa6g4fp@published"&gt;While I do wish Laura had consulted us before allowing Vivianna to get her ears pierced, I personally don’t have a problem with it—I knew girls younger than that with pierced ears when I was a kid. I think my wife is needlessly blowing this totally out of proportion. She is forcing everyone in the family to choose sides and using access to our kids as leverage. It’s turned into an incredibly ugly situation, and it didn’t need to escalate to this level. Laura has always been the cool aunt whom the kids look forward to seeing, and they are both incredibly sad over the whole thing. Laura sent a note of apology, which my wife immediately tore up and mailed back to her. Whenever I attempt to reason with Kaitlyn, I am told I can either choose her and the kids or my sister. Is there any way to repair this family rift?&lt;/p&gt;

It shows a clear lack of judgement on her part, and I understand why your wife might not trust her decision-making skills.&lt;/p&gt;

Trying to get into a physical altercation? Sending back ripped up letters? What is she 15? Does she actually expect you to make some kind of decision between your sister and your kids? None of this is OK.&lt;/p&gt;

(I might suggest approaching this conversation with curiosity instead of an “attempt to reason” with her.) Maybe there’s some bigger issue. You might start by trying to ask exactly what about the pierced ears upset her. It may have been that your wife wanted to be there for this step of her daughter’s life. It might be about the principle of it not having been cleared with you first. Or maybe these actions your wife took in response might point to some larger issue between her and your sister that reached its crescendo with the piercing incident. Getting her to explore the actual details of what’s upsetting her might help her realize that her behavior is outsized and also not helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

For most people, this time-savvy 15-minute trick will fit the bill nicely, and it’s not overly strenuous either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advice, quite simply, is to “move after meals”. And the easiest way to do this is to go for a brisk &lt;a href="/topic/walking"&gt;walk&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://news.ua.edu/ua-theme-expert/elroy-joseph-aguiar/"&gt;Dr Elroy Aguiar&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of &lt;a href="/topic/exercise"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; science at &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ua.edu%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CHarry.Bullmore%40independent.co.uk%7C737bf0e8fbee4162e11708dcc6b51171%7C0f3a4c644dc54a768d4152d85ca158a5%7C0%7C0%7C638603728215436465%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=HQCZVfDiIGFM%2FhVz7b%2BNiSdc0NBKy3E%2FJumsFAwHQYQ%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0"&gt;The University of Alabama&lt;/a&gt; who specialises in all things step-related. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A (admittedly very small) study published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3119587/"&gt;International Journal of General Medicine&lt;/a&gt; suggested that walking immediately after a meal was more effective for &lt;a href="/topic/weight-loss"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; than strolling for the same amount of time later in the day. This could have something to do with its ability to regulate blood glucose (aka blood sugar) levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why should you walk after meals?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that even a short amount of exercise has an immediate effect,” says Dr Aguiar. “Straight away, you get lower blood pressure and lower blood glucose.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This ties in with another &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/36/10/3262/30770/Three-15-min-Bouts-of-Moderate-Postmeal-Walking"&gt;study on postprandial walking&lt;/a&gt; [walking after a meal]. It looked at whether it was better to exercise for 15 minutes straight after meals, three times per day, or to get the same amount of exercise in the morning or evening, so there were three different groups.” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focussed on “older persons at risk for glucose intolerance”, and found that those who walked immediately after meals had the lowest blood glucose response – shallower peaks and troughs – across the whole day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because, during exercise, glucose is pulled into the cells of the working muscles to be used as energy. As a result, your blood glucose lowers, which can help you maintain more consistent energy levels and lessen the load on your pancreas as it aims to regulate blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea is that you eat a meal, you do 15 minutes of postprandial exercise, and that’s going to reduce your blood glucose spike and maintain your blood glucose in a better range for up to 24 or 48 hours,” Dr Aguiar explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/exercise-snacking-workouts-b2623880.html"&gt;exercise snacking&lt;/a&gt;. You’re breaking down a larger volume of exercise, so you don’t have to run for an hour and sweat buckets. Just 15 minutes of walking after each main meal is going to be beneficial for your health on its own.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 gEpeSZ iTNirO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who can benefit from walking after meals?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This advice is particularly prevalent for people who are insulin resistant, have pre-diabetes or have elevated blood pressure. But Dr Aguiar stresses that it shouldn’t be exclusive to these groups, and pretty much anyone can benefit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s helpful for everyone because you’re decreasing the amount of work your pancreas has to do to deal with that extra amount of glucose in your bloodstream,” says Dr Aguiar. “We refer to things like diabetes and metabolic syndrome [a combination of five cardiovascular risk factors; elevated waist circumference, high triglycerides, low high-density lipoproteins or ‘good cholesterol’, high blood pressure and high blood sugar] as silent killers because their effects accumulate over years and decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Immediately after exercise, you get lower blood pressure and lower blood glucose.” he explains. “That effect over years and decades is what prevents you from getting metabolic syndrome, diabetes and hypertension [high blood pressure]. All of these things accumulate slowly over a long period of time, but if you exercise you can reverse them before they become a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/treadmill-cardio-workout-walking-10000-steps-b2676664.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the 12-3-30 treadmill workout better than walking 10,000 steps a day? I tried both to find out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to get the most out of walking after meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If postprandial walking sounds like something you can get behind, Dr Aguiar has a few suggestions for maximising the many benefits. Firstly, he recommends holding a higher &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;cadence &lt;/a&gt;or step frequency (130 steps per minute or more) than you would during a casual saunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You want to hold a brisk pace where you feel slightly breathless or you have a light sweat on the surface of your skin. You can even simplify it down to the talk-sing test – walk at a pace where you can just about hold a conversation but you can’t sing. That’s moderate-intensity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This aligns with the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/physical-activity-guidelines-for-adults-aged-19-to-64/"&gt;NHS’s&lt;/a&gt; physical activity guidelines for adults: at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-kettlebell-workout-b2677399.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I tried ‘the best kettlebell workout’, and it was surprisingly simple yet effective in just 10 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercising every day, or at least every other day, at a moderate-intensity, is going to improve your blood pressure and blood glucose levels,” adds Dr Aguiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over time, that’s going to improve things like HDL cholesterol, the good cholesterol, reduce your LDLs or bad cholesterol, then also result in weight change and a reduction in waist circumference. This means it covers all of the five risk factors for metabolic syndrome.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Aguiar explains that, “you can target all of them with exercise in the short-term, and also make a difference in the long-term, spanning years and decades, as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, if you want to take steps to future-proof your health, a 15-minute post-meal stroll is an excellent place to start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/healthy-drinking-tips-dry-january-b2676392.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t want to do Dry January?

However, instead of investing in various lotions and potions that may or may not effectively contribute to healthy aging, a group of scientists suggests that the fountain of youth could be hiding in your fridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, researchers from Edith Cowan University, Queen's University Belfast, and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health published a new study in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250505121914.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Journal of Clinical Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, showcasing how certain foods could help people age more gracefully and enjoy longer, healthier lives. It all comes down to flavonoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The goal of medical research is not just to help people live longer but to ensure they stay healthy for as long as possible," Dr Nicola Bondonno, an adjunct lecturer at ECU, shared in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250505121914.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. "We know from previous research that people who have a higher flavonoid intake tend to live longer, and they are also less likely to get any of the major chronic diseases such as dementia, diabetes, or heart disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What exactly are flavonoids?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2016 research review in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5465813/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of Nutritional Science;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Journal of Nutritional Science&lt;/a&gt; explains that flavonoids are "a group of natural substances … found in fruits, vegetables, grains, bark, roots, stems, flowers, tea, and wine." Vegetables use them to help grow and defend against plaque buildup. They also provide the vibrant colors found in fruits, vegetables, and flowers. "Currently, there are about 6,000 flavonoids that contribute to the colourful pigments of fruits, herbs, vegetables, and medicinal plants," the study stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can these flavonoids do for people?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavonoids are well known for reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, supporting blood vessel health, and even helping to maintain skeletal muscle mass — all of which are important for preventing frailty and maintaining physical function and mental health as we age," professor Aedin Cassidy from Queens University Belfast, and senior author of the study, shared. "Our research shows that people who consume more flavonoids tend to age better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To come to this conclusion, the researchers analyzed data from the Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, which tracked 62,743 women and 23,687 men over the course of 24 years. They calculated flavonoid intake by tracking each study's "food frequency questionnaires."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/best-diet-for-healthy-aging-alternative-healthy-eating-index-11727782" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Only 1 in 10 People Age Well — and They All Have This Eating Plan in Common;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Only 1 in 10 People Age Well — and They All Have This Eating Plan in Common&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After analyzing the numbers, the researchers found that women who consumed the most flavonoids had a 15% lower risk of frailty and a 12% lower risk of poor mental health. They also found that these women had a 12% lower risk of "impaired physical function" when compared to those with a lower flavonoid intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men had fewer extreme health associations, but it still resulted in a net positive for those who consumed the most flavonoids. However, the researchers noted that this difference could be attributed to the varying follow-up times between the two gender cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that participants who increased their intake of flavonoid-rich food by three servings a day had a 6% to 11% lower risk across all three of the ageing outcomes in females, and a 15% lower risk of poor mental health in males," Cassidy added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The researchers found that these specific foods pack the biggest flavonoid punch.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the findings, "... increases in intakes of tea, red wine, apples, blueberries, and oranges [and orange juice] tended to be associated with lower risks of all outcomes." The researchers also specifically highlighted black tea as an excellent option in a &lt;a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/Research/GRI/TheInstituteforGlobalFoodSecurity/institute-for-global-security-news/Blackteaandberriescouldcontributetohealthierageing.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; about their study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the list of flavonoid-rich foods and drinks is much longer than that. As the review in the Journal of Nutritional Science explained, flavones, one of the subgroups within flavonoids, can be found in items such as celery, parsley, red peppers, chamomile, mint, and ginkgo biloba, white onions, kale, lettuce, tomatoes, apples, grapes, and berries are "rich sources of flavonols." It added that another subgroup, isoflavonoids, is somewhat more limited but is "predominantly found in soybeans and other leguminous plants." Additionally, one more group, anthocyanins, which are the pigments "responsible for colors in plants, flowers and fruits," are found in all the most colorful (and delicious) fruits, including "cranberries, black currants, red grapes, merlot grapes, raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, bilberries, and blackberries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/bananas-lower-blood-pressure-study-11727728" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Inexpensive Fruit Can Help Lower Your Blood Pressure Naturally, Study Suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Inexpensive Fruit Can Help Lower Your Blood Pressure Naturally, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, any fruit, vegetable, or tea will provide the flavonoids you're looking for. But if you truly want to do everything possible to prevent frailty in old age, the researchers in the latest study indicate that you need one additional component: Protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The significance of diet — both quantity and quality — in mitigating frailty is widely acknowledged, with higher protein intake, better diet quality, and a higher consumption of healthy plant-based foods, consistently being identified as key factors,: they noted.

Most patients recover quickly, but a small minority suffer heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Although broken heart syndrome is most common in women, men die from it at more than twice the rate, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.037219" target="_blank"&gt;a study published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study analyzed data from nearly 200,000 adults in the U.S. who were hospitalized with broken heart syndrome from 2016 to 2020. Around 11% of men in that group died, compared with roughly 5% of women. The data reinforce &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002914921009371" target="_blank"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; that showed &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/clc.23109" target="_blank"&gt;higher mortality rates in men&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It seems to be a consistent finding that men don’t get takotsubo syndrome as much, but when they do, they do worse,” said Dr. Harmony Reynolds, director of the Sarah Ross Soter Center for Women’s Cardiovascular Research at NYU Langone Health, who wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The differences between men and women may have something to do with what’s triggering their conditions, cardiologists said. In men, broken heart syndrome is usually brought on by a physical stressor, such as a surgery or stroke. In women, the impetus is typically emotional, like losing a job or loved one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The people with emotional stressors actually do quite well,” said Dr. Ilan Wittstein, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins Medicine, who wasn’t part of the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Men may be more at risk for dying and having bad outcomes because they’re less susceptible to begin with,” he said. “So it takes a more dangerous trigger to precipitate the syndrome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study’s lead author, Dr. Mohammad Movahed, said men may also have a harder time recovering from broken heart syndrome since they &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2025/01/16/men-women-and-social-connections/" target="_blank"&gt;tend to have less social support&lt;/a&gt; to help them manage stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“If you have this stressful trigger, and the stress is not gone, that’s probably going to continue to harm the heart, or at least reduce the chance of recovery,” said Movahed, a cardiologist at the University of Arizona’s Sarver Heart Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But scientists still have lingering questions about what’s driving the syndrome, and why people die from it in rare cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“People are still looking for the holy grail of what causes this condition,” Wittstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is stress the only trigger?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;To confirm that a person has broken heart syndrome, doctors look for a few tell-tale signs. In a typical patient, part of their heart muscle is enlarged like a balloon, but they do not have a blocked artery, which is usually associated with heart attacks. Most patients can also point to a stressful event that predated the episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The stresses that we endure in our daily lives, both physical and emotional, can in fact take tolls on us,” said Dr. Matthew Tomey, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York City. “You can feel the heartache in those moments, and there may literally be some heartache of sorts that’s accompanying that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But Wittstein said stress alone may not be enough to trigger broken heart syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Some people just get a little frustrated at work, or somebody was out jogging a little too vigorously, or somebody just got stuck at a red light and was annoyed,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Reynolds said one of her patients has had the syndrome four times — each event precipitated by minor stomach bugs that caused her to vomit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“She just really hates vomiting and will throw up and get” takotsubo cardiomyopathy, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wittstein now believes some patients may have an underlying susceptibility to broken heart syndrome. His research suggests that stress hormones can constrict tiny blood vessels surrounding the heart, which decrease blood flow. That would make certain people, such as those with high blood pressure or high cholesterol, more susceptible, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Research has also shown that post-menopausal women are more prone to broken heart syndrome. Wittstein said that’s probably due, in part, to a decline in estrogen, which helps dilate the tiny blood vessels around the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But Reynolds said there’s not enough research to know that for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s at some level obvious that sex hormones are implicated but trying to draw that link and really connect the dots, we have not gotten there yet,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard to treat, hard to prevent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cardiologists said the mysteries surrounding broken heart syndrome can make it hard to prevent or treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors occasionally prescribe medications used for other heart issues, such as beta blockers, or find ways to help people reduce stress, such as meditating and talking to a mental health professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We have not found anything so far — any medication, any specific treatment — that can reduce complications or reduce mortality,” Movahed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;His new study found that deaths from broken heart syndrome were relatively stable from 2016 to 2020 — a sign that the current treatment landscape isn’t sufficient, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But Wittstein said the study relied on diagnostic codes given to hospitalized patients, which can sometimes miss the full picture of what contributed to a person’s death, especially if that person had a stroke or other neurological issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’m quite sure that some of these people recovered from the broken heart syndrome and then died of complications of something else,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cardiologists said their best advice is to encourage patients to go to the hospital if they have chest pain or shortness of breath, and not to dismiss their symptoms as stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“You can’t tell the difference between this and traditional heart attacks until you get to the hospital and have a series of tests,” Reynolds said. “So it is not appropriate to stay home when you have chest pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNRFc1RmdlUzBSVUxzdTY2NS1VS1hTcWh4aFRfSDIzUEtBN2hoTm0tS2Z5dnhoa0h1QWlzV0lMY2pYVXZiU3Yzd1FlVHdWa3pjYjV0MmFOMTBJRDdnNHVJd1dMRGIwMU5LRUR1alhxLVg5cF9sU1lnRkZsdW1pNTJ4aEVERXVfZ19JYXFHRTVidUJmQjNvemJWLXFSUWItckg0XzNQcktPMWJld9IBVkFVX3lxTFBjLW9OLUVIZ2FfNTJZTHdpa0ZTZVN4UmxDQjZ3UVhYVUM0VlJxbVZxRlZpWDZ4X2UyazVXWkxBbHU4WGhQc1dpb2kzWWUtMEU3QUtfRGlR</guid></item><item><title>黑水热的致命谜团：寻找导致乌干达儿童死亡的疾病的答案--《卫报》 | The deadly riddle of blackwater fever: the search for answers over illness killing Uganda’s children - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi5gFBVV95cUxNd3BGb2UzOFU0NjBGcHpkdktEa1pJaTdpZEo5N2R1R2c2emhpU0dWVXB3aVlKUEhfLVJrWHRrUnhRTFhyeVpnUWt3THJhWWJrZnBPaVVQWWxRcHMwS0pscGJjZ3N1UnRtc1BpcVZtazVDUFZFYm9qRGxXcXlvMlNKU0pxQjBUNngxR1ZubGZ6Ym5KQ0xvVkFXMURTei1HWXBMR3o5akYxTXJMelk5ZHFCVUFfMDI5b3NyaV84M0tZOEdyREEtOGpOeko3TTVQWG1hcU5ieFVvSEtwMmt1LUJucnU5MjdOZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;y the age of six, Babirye Zainab had already contracted malaria several times.

A month later, she had another episode. Since then, she has experienced quite a number of episodes of passing tea-coloured urine,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Zainab is part of a medical riddle affecting rural &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/uganda" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She has blackwater fever, a rare but increasing complication of malaria that researchers are trying to explain. So named because patients’ urine turns dark with blood, it can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Blackwater fever happens when red blood cells break down, rapidly, in the bloodstream. They release haemoglobin and this is excreted in urine. It can result in anaemia and jaundice and require blood transfusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Kathryn Maitland of Imperial College London, based in Kenya, was part of a team that noticed high numbers of children in eastern Uganda with blackwater almost a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28362936/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paper published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt; they reported that the condition “according to local investigators, was rare until the last seven years” and speculated “that this might relate to the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapies”, the most modern type of antimalarial drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since then, Maitland says, “we have been digging, digging, digging”, looking for an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Historically, blackwater fever was seen among European expatriates who took small doses of quinine as an antimalarial, and became less common when other drugs took over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;What is very interesting in African children is that once they’ve had one episode, they tend to get it again and again&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It certainly wasn’t mentioned in the World Health Organization guidelines for severe malaria – it was recorded as a very rare occurrence. But it is increasing,” says Maitland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Her research team has looked at possible genetic causes including whether genes linked to sickle cell or &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/g6pd-glucose6phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency#:~:text=G6PD%20deficiency%20is%20when%20the,faster%20than%20they%20normally%20would." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;G6PD enzyme deficiency&lt;/a&gt;, which raises the risk of red blood cells rupturing, might be involved. Neither seemed to be the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A theory that the drugs used for malaria in the affected part of Uganda might be substandard or fakes was debunked by thorough testing. “The drugs are good – so we’re back to the drawing board,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The best hypothesis, she says, based on the experience of doctors in affected areas, remains a link to artemisinin-based malaria treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The presentation can be alarming, Maitland says. One child with blackwater fever was admitted to a hospital in the capital, Kampala. “They started to pass red and black urine. This was a time when there was Ebola around and it triggered an evacuation – all the mothers saw this, picked their kids up and ran out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Affected children “have a high risk of dying”, she says. They may need multiple blood transfusions, raising the risk of an adverse reaction, and requiring hospitalisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“What is very interesting in African children is that once they’ve had one episode, they tend to get it again and again,” she says. “Presumably every time they get reinfected with malaria parasites, they get blackwater fever.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-18" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Global Dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"global-dispatch","successDescription":"Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since turning eight, she has been out of school because of anaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I often have to take her to the health facility due to her frail condition. She is out of school because of this,” says her grandmother, who has cared for her since she was six months old. “When she falls sick, I might even spend a week in the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Sometimes there are no drugs, and the family have to find private supplies. If Zainab needs a transfusion and there is no blood available locally, they have to travel to the regional hospital “which is very costly”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Zainab and her grandmother are now part of a research programme led by Jane Frances Zalwango of the Uganda National Institute of Public Health. She has a fellowship from a global healthcare company to track cases of blackwater fever in Uganda, and understand why some children develop the conditionand others do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Uganda is still building its surveillance system, says Zalwango, meaning numbers are not comprehensive, but the data they do have on cases indicates a rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study has enrolled 400 children from Budaka district in eastern Uganda, where initial surveillance efforts recorded the highest numbers. Half have blackwater fever, while half have had malaria without developing the complication. They were followed for months, with blood samples taken to analyse immunological markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Mary Rodgers, an associate research fellow at global healthcare company Abbott, whose programme is part of the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.tephinet.org/__;!!N96JrnIq8IfO5w!nhszsIcp3X4Czpm4PNInPQxoy-QEiS-XlbGjCAijm3PU8KMXO1NSxZ5USB4YO19hPIfOFzy00MkbXC_-vhwyxB8$" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Training Programs in Epidemiology and Public Health Interventions Network&lt;/a&gt; (Tephinet), said other theories under consideration included whether malaria in combination with a genetic factor, or “a co-infecting pathogen that might not otherwise make people sick” were involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="76ceec95-86ba-4f22-882c-13090b2e7fac" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":27,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"What is gene drive and how could it help in the fight against malaria?

			&lt;p&gt;Upon learning about &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-do-fingers-get-wrinkly-after-a-long-bath-or-swim-a-biomedical-engineer-explains-204726"&gt;the blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; responsible for our water-soaked finger wrinkles, young readers of &lt;em&gt;The Conversation's&lt;/em&gt;  Curious Kids series had further questions for scientists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Do the wrinkles always form in the same way?" one asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And I thought: I haven't the foggiest clue!" &lt;a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/5547/do-your-fingers-wrinkle-the-same-way-every-time-youre-in-the-water-too-long-new-research-says-yes"&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt; the author of the educational article, biomedical engineer Guy German from Binghamton University in New York . "So it led to this research to find out."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German and his colleague Rachel Laytin recruited three volunteers to soak their fingers for 30 minutes. Images confirm the patterns of looped peaks and valleys adorning the participants' sodden fingertips mostly repeated themselves when they were soaked again 24 hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161033" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161033" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/LinesShowingTheSimilarityAndDifferencesOfFingerWringlingOnDifferentDays-e1747024909680.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-161033 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161033" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Lines trace the same wrinkles (black) and different wrinkles (red) on a volunteer's ring finger, after soaking on two different days. (Laytin &amp;amp; German, &lt;em&gt;J Mech Behav Biomed Mater&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As water seeps through open sweat ducts into our skin, it eventually decreases the concentration of salt in our outer layer. Nerve fibers alert the brain to this change in skin condition, which then triggers our bodies' automatic blood vessel retraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When these tiny skin vessels shrink, they drag the surface of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470464/"&gt;our largest organ&lt;/a&gt; down with them, shriveling once-smooth fingers and toes into a rougher, pruney texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161032" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161032" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/FingerWrinklesAfterSoakingOnceThenAgain24HoursLater-e1747024489425.jpg" alt="An image of a smooth finger tip and then two similar water wrinkled fingers" class="wp-image-161032 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161032" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The changes observed in one of the volunteer's finger tips across the experiment. (Laytin &amp;amp; German, &lt;em&gt;J Mech Behav Biomed Mater&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Blood vessels don't change their position much – they move around a bit, but in relation to other blood vessels, they're pretty static," &lt;a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/5547/do-your-fingers-wrinkle-the-same-way-every-time-youre-in-the-water-too-long-new-research-says-yes"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; German. "That means the wrinkles should form in the same manner, and we proved that they do."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puckering isn't just a random side-effect either. The morphological changes create a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253185"&gt;measurable advantage in wet conditions&lt;/a&gt;: the skin's temporary grooves and ridges provide a better grip, making it easier for us to walk on or grasp sodden things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As these wrinkles give us super grip it seems odd we don't keep them full time. While researchers don't know why this is, they suspect the temporary texture might &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/proven-pruney-fingers-give-you-a-better-grip-598524/"&gt;reduce our finger's sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; or make them more vulnerable to injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161044" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161044" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SkinAnatomyDiagramWithoutHair-e1747026752524.jpg" alt="Your Fingers Wrinkle The Same Way Each Time They're Soaked" class="wp-image-161044 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SkinAnatomyDiagramWithoutHair-e1747026752524.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SkinAnatomyDiagramWithoutHair-e1747026752524-362x415.jpg 362w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SkinAnatomyDiagramWithoutHair-e1747026752524-600x687.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161044" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;When small blood vessels inside the skin contract, they make your skin wrinkle.(&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Skin_layers.png"&gt;Madhero88/Wikipedia/CC BY SA 3.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was originally assumed that swelling caused soaked skin to wrinkle, but a &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10439-016-1764-6&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=docs&amp;amp;ust=1747188450836924&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2wkESk6xIQvpsdPDkxHVu5"&gt;study in 2016&lt;/a&gt; revealed our skin would need to swell at least 20 percent for that to happen. What's more, previous research found people with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0084949"&gt;nerve damage don't experience finger pruning&lt;/a&gt;, leading to further investigation of the mechanisms involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've heard that wrinkles don't form in people who have median nerve damage in their fingers," &lt;a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/5547/do-your-fingers-wrinkle-the-same-way-every-time-youre-in-the-water-too-long-new-research-says-yes"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; German. "One of my students told us, 'I've got median nerve damage in my fingers.' So we tested him – no wrinkles!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-do-fingers-get-wrinkly-after-a-long-bath-or-swim-a-biomedical-engineer-explains-204726"&gt;sating childlike curiosity&lt;/a&gt;, such details can assist in forensics. For example, understanding this finger skin distortion could help identify bodies after prolonged water exposure after natural disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we can now add wrinkle topology to the set of consistent patterns that compose our skin, along with fingerprints and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-actually-have-secret-stripes-and-other-strange-markings"&gt;hidden stripes&lt;/a&gt; we all possess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161043" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161043" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/DiagramOfBlaschkoLinesOnFrontAndBackOfHumanBody.jpg" alt="Your Fingers Wrinkle The Same Way Each Time They're Soaked" class="wp-image-161043 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/DiagramOfBlaschkoLinesOnFrontAndBackOfHumanBody.jpg 914w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/DiagramOfBlaschkoLinesOnFrontAndBackOfHumanBody-642x637.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/DiagramOfBlaschkoLinesOnFrontAndBackOfHumanBody-418x415.jpg 418w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/DiagramOfBlaschkoLinesOnFrontAndBackOfHumanBody-768x762.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/DiagramOfBlaschkoLinesOnFrontAndBackOfHumanBody-600x595.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 914px) 100vw, 914px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161043" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-actually-have-secret-stripes-and-other-strange-markings"&gt;Lines of Blaschko&lt;/a&gt; are another example of consistent patterns that arise from our skin's physiology.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists studying chimpanzees in Budongo Forest, Uganda, have observed that these primates don't just treat their own injuries, but care for others, too—information which could shed light on how our ancestors first began treating wounds and using medicines.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Although chimpanzees elsewhere have been observed helping other community members with &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/medical+problems/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical problems&lt;/a&gt;, the persistent presence of this behavior in Budongo could suggest that &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/medical+care/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical care&lt;/a&gt; among chimpanzees is much more widespread than we realized, and not confined to care for close relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our research helps illuminate the evolutionary roots of human medicine and health care systems," said Dr. Elodie Freymann of the University of Oxford, first author of the article in &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution&lt;/i&gt;. "By documenting how chimpanzees identify and utilize &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/medicinal+plants/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medicinal plants&lt;/a&gt; and provide care to others, we gain insight into the cognitive and social foundations of human health care behaviors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community care&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists studied two communities of chimpanzees in the Budongo Forest—Sonso and Waibira. Like all chimpanzees, members of these communities are vulnerable to injuries, whether caused by fights, accidents, or snares set by humans. About 40% of all individuals in Sonso have been seen with snare injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers spent four months observing each community, as well as drawing on &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/video+evidence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;video evidence&lt;/a&gt; from the Great Ape Dictionary database, logbooks containing decades of observational data, and a survey of other scientists who had witnessed chimpanzees treating illness or injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any plants chimpanzees were seen using for external care were identified; several turned out to have chemical properties which could improve &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/wound+healing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;wound healing&lt;/a&gt; and relevant traditional medicine uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their direct observational periods, the scientists recorded 12 injuries in Sonso, all of which were likely caused by within-group conflicts. In Waibira, five chimpanzees were injured—one female by a snare, and four males in fights. The researchers also identified more cases of care in Sonso than in Waibira.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This likely stems from several factors, including possible differences in social hierarchy stability or greater observation opportunities in the more thoroughly habituated Sonso community," said Freymann.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;The roots of modern medicine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers documented 41 cases of care overall: seven cases of care for others—prosocial care—and 34 cases of self-care. These cases often included several different care behaviors, which might be treating different aspects of a wound, or might reflect a chimpanzee's personal preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Chimpanzee wound care encompasses several techniques: direct wound licking, which removes debris and potentially applies antimicrobial compounds in saliva; finger licking followed by wound pressing; leaf-dabbing; and chewing plant materials and applying them directly to wounds," said Freymann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"All chimpanzees mentioned in our tables showed recovery from wounds, though, of course, we don't know what the outcome would have been had they not done anything about their injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We also documented hygiene behaviors, including the cleaning of genitals with leaves after mating and wiping the anus with leaves after defecation—practices that may help prevent infections."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who cares?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the seven instances of prosocial care, the researchers found four cases of wound treatment, two cases of snare removal assistance, and one case where a chimpanzee helped another with hygiene. Care wasn't preferentially given by, or provided to, one sex or age group. On four occasions, care was given to genetically unrelated individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These behaviors add to the evidence from other sites that chimpanzees appear to recognize need or suffering in others and take deliberate action to alleviate it, even when there's no direct genetic advantage," said Freymann.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The scientists call for more research into the social and ecological contexts in which care takes place, and which individuals give and receive care. One possibility is that the high risk of injury and death which Budongo chimpanzees all face from snares could increase the likelihood that these &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/chimpanzees/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chimpanzees&lt;/a&gt; care for each other's wounds, but we need more data to explore this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study has a few methodological limitations," cautioned Freymann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The difference in habituation between the Sonso and Waibira communities creates an observation bias, particularly for rare behaviors like prosocial health care. While we documented plants used in health care contexts, further pharmacological analyses are needed to confirm their specific medicinal properties and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Also, the relative rarity of prosocial health care makes it challenging to identify patterns regarding when and why such care is provided or withheld. These limitations highlight directions for future research in this emerging field."&lt;/p&gt;
