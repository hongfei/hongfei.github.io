Now there are growing worries about next year’s flu vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, the Food and Drug Administration — now with vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the helm — unexpectedly and without reason canceled a March meeting of scientists who advise the FDA on vaccine policy. A similar meeting at the Centers for Disease Control was postponed last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, the head of the University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, joined Morning Edition host Cathy Wurzer to talk about the implications of axing the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_timelines_for_flu_vaccines_are_tight._why_do_cancellations_of_these_march_meetings_matter%3F_"&gt;Timelines for flu vaccines are tight. Why do cancellations of these March meetings matter? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes about six months for the virus that scientists use for the vaccine to grow. It’s then available in late summer or early fall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="donate-ask undefined"&gt;&lt;div class="donate-ask-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;MPR News helps you turn down the noise and build shared understanding. Turn up your support for this public resource and keep trusted journalism accessible to all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like planting a garden,” Osterholm said. “If you postpone it two months, you might be in trouble when you can harvest, and if you can harvest it at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timeline is already tight to make an educated estimation on what flu strains will be a problem next year, and the virus can change between now and then. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But this is our best guess and our best attempt to give us the best match for the virus circulating next winter and what’s in the vaccine,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_since_the_vaccine_is_often_grown_in_chicken_eggs%2C_could_bird_flu_affect_development%3F_"&gt;Since the vaccine is often grown in chicken eggs, could bird flu affect development? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is no. And Osterholm said this is some good news among the bad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Right after 9/11, when we had so many concerns about terrorism and so forth happening, the U.S. government took extra effort, along with the vaccine manufacturers, to secure the facilities where these chickens actually lay the eggs,” Osterholm said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eggs used by scientists are embryonated, meaning they’re fertilized and growing a fetal chicken. The chickens are raised under tight biosecurity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The buildings are airtight with special filters,” Osterholm explained. “And so we feel pretty confident that even if a H5N1 situation is occurring in the region where these egg-producing locations are at, we’re still in really good shape.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_can_the_vaccines_be_manufactured_without_fda_or_cdc_panel_guidance%3F_"&gt;Can the vaccines be manufactured without FDA or CDC panel guidance? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panels evaluate what’s been happening with the flu in the southern hemisphere. The strains circulating there typically predict what’s likely to happen in the U.S. four to five months later, according to Osterholm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And without those kind of data, we can’t do that,” he said. “It’s not just something casually done saying, ‘Ah, let’s just go with that one, OK?’ Now there really is a major effort made to come up with the closest match we can. So this timing and the meetings themselves are very, very important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_if_the_federal_government_scales_back_mass_vaccination%2C_how_could_people_still_get_shots%3F_"&gt;If the federal government scales back mass vaccination, how could people still get shots? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this point, we are really in the worst place I’ve been in my 50-year career in terms of vaccine preventable diseases,” Osterholm said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several state governments, in line with Kennedy, are increasingly identifying as anti-vaccine. For example, the Surgeon General of Louisiana recently issued a statement saying the state department of health no longer supports vaccine campaigns for children — and for parents that want them, to seek immunizations out independently. In Texas and New Mexico, there’s a worsening outbreak of measles, which the U.S. declared eliminated back in 2000. However, dropping rates of MMR vaccines for kids are bringing the disease out of the shadows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And so there is this ever-creeping concern coming into the vaccine picture of people who are not getting vaccinated,” Osterholm continued. “We have a real battle on our hands right now in terms of helping the public understand what will happen if they’re not vaccinating their kids. What this means is this is not without a consequence. So you may think you’re making a moral choice. We're also making a choice that can end up killing your child.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osterholm also pointed out that federal governments in the past have been a leader in the discussion, calling it “unfortunate” that it’s not the present case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_can_states_continue_vaccine_programs_if_the_federal_government_stops_dispersing_shots%3F_"&gt;Can states continue vaccine programs if the federal government stops dispersing shots? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ meeting was canceled recently. When the group makes a recommendation on vaccines, it’s affirmed by the CDC and triggers a sequence of events, including covering child vaccination programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without that, you basically don’t have a mechanism for paying for these vaccines, and so it’s a much larger issue than just telling parents that this is a good thing to do,” Osterholm explained. “It also makes the wheels of public health turn.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many state and local health departments in the U.S. have immunization programs largely supported by federal dollars. Osterholm is concerned that there’ll be a mass reduction in these programs under the Trump Administration. He also expects hefty layoffs at the CDC in the coming weeks, which will directly impact local health programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The whole system right now is devolving into, frankly, a black hole,” he said. “I am incredibly, incredibly concerned that we’re going to see a major erosion in [vaccination] for children in this country over the next year or two, and it will absolutely result in major outbreaks.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_are_you_worried_about_pandemic_readiness%2C_should_one_occur%3F_"&gt;Are you worried about pandemic readiness, should one occur? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone has to understand the pandemic clock is ticking. We just don’t know what time it is,” Osterholm warned, underlining there will be more pandemics — and they could be worse than COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Are we prepared for this? Absolutely not,” he said. “We have so many lessons that should have and could have been learned from what we went through with COVID that no one really ever took the time in federal governments or organizations to really review that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I fear that we’re going to go into the next pandemic… not any better prepared,” Osterholm continued. “But more importantly, we have a public now that distrusts public health unlike any time in modern history.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MPR News</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNdHBwU2lTelRBODBjcG1hTUV4UXljbmJlVWE1WWtfaXBaT2VJM2FzTTV0cnJnRmNvNmZULXg0bzNxOFp6M2Jkel8xNS1UcmhySnN0NDhZU1lQRTJtMVlpblZPckFNeHJ3Rjh5WUc5dzIwbzI3RjMwQi1VR2Z5WDJBSWNPR2xLTnFQSUVFMC15U25SWklTMkFoV05nM2N4VUhQS1dWSEZoVml2VzNISzZlTjN6bw</guid></item><item><title>In Texas Measles Outbreak, Signs of a Riskier Future for Children - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE0zOG9aemVMeTRpcmtkVjFtQzFTZlJDbm1GU2RhZ19uX29YWFcwZVhQVHVtWmo3bUZoZkdqeG1BcE5xTWh2NUpXR29rTnZoMllucWlXcmJPRjNZSTZUbnE0WTNqLUwxTnRUMGRjd05DYURNa2pLcHRv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Every day, as Dr. Wendell Parkey enters his clinic in Seminole, a small city on the rural western edge of Texas, he announces his arrival to the staff with an anthem pumping loudly through speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As the song reaches a climax, he throws up an arm and strikes a pose in cowboy boots. “Y’all ready to stomp out disease?” he asks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Recently, the question has taken on a dark urgency. Seminole Memorial Hospital, where Dr. Parkey has practiced for nearly three decades, has found itself at the center of the largest measles outbreak in the United States since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Since last month, more than 140 Texas residents, most of whom live in the surrounding Gaines County, have been diagnosed and 20 have been hospitalized. Nine people in a bordering county in New Mexico have also fallen ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;On Wednesday, local health officials announced that one child had died, the first measles death in the United States in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It may not be the last.

&lt;p&gt;The study will trial the use of double immunotherapy. In some patients, double immunotherapy will be combined with chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial will be led by The Brain Cancer Centre, which has world-leading expertise in glioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted to be handing the baton to &lt;a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/researcher/jim-whittle/"&gt;Dr Jim Whittle&lt;/a&gt;, a leading Australian neuro-oncologist at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Co-Head of Research Strategy at The Brain Cancer Centre, to commence a broader scientific study to scientifically determine if – and how – this process might work in treating glioblastoma,” said Prof Long, who also secured drug access for the clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While we are buoyed by the results of this experimental treatment so far, a clinical trial in a large group of patients would need to happen before anyone could consider it a possible breakthrough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Whittle, also a laboratory head at WEHI, said: “We are pleased to be able to build on this exciting work by diving into the process of designing a clinical trial, which takes time, care and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When that process is complete, the result will be a world first clinical trial that enables us to thoroughly test the hypothesis against a representative sample of patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brain Cancer Centre was founded by Carrie’s Beanies 4 Brain Cancer and established in partnership with WEHI with support from the Victorian Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centre brings together a growing network of world-leading oncologists, immunologists, neurosurgeons, bioinformaticians and cancer biologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commencement of recruitment for the clinical trial will be announced by The Brain Cancer Centre at a later date and will be limited to eligible patients.&lt;/p&gt;

that &lt;span&gt;the condition, which often causes painful rashes, was 'very likely' to be spreading undetected in Britain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lab tests to confirm cases of the 'slow growing bug' can take up to three weeks for results to come back, they warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition itself can lurk in the body for days before causing tell-tale symptoms, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Describing the new case, medics at Andreas Syngros Hospital of Venereal and Dermatological Diseases, said the patient had ring-shaped lesions on the skin and small, pus-filled, inflamed bumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similar lesions had recently appeared on his partner, he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors carried out tests for syphilis as well as a fungal culture, the latter of which confirmed the presence of TMVII. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/advance-article/doi/10.1093/qjmed/hcaf049/8015625?login=true"&gt;QJM: An International Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the medics said: 'T&lt;span&gt;he patient was further questioned about his recent travel history or contact with domestic animals and revealed that his partner had traveled to North Africa one month prior to the appearance of the rash.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It comes as US health officials in June confirmed one man in New York had become the first ever to contract the infection via sex in the US. Pictured, patient A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He was prescribed terbinafine and flutrimazole, antifungal medications typically used to treat fungal nail infections and ringworm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, a follow-up appointment three weeks later his skin showed 'no improvement' and he was switched to powerful antifungal medication itraconazole. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The patient was subsequently re-evaluated every two weeks showing gradual but slow improvement,' doctors said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After six weeks of treatment, the rash had cleared. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Physicians should remain vigilant in recognising and reporting cases of this emerging pathogen,' they added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;TMVII is hypothesized to be transmitted from human-to-human through sexual contact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Evidence supporting this transmission mode includes the typical localisation of the initial lesions in the genital or gluteal areas, and the higher incidence of cases among groups engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors, such as men who have sex with men.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Then in November, US health officials also reported that a further three cases had been detected in the city. Pictured, patient B &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then in November, US health officials also reported that a further three cases had been detected in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as US health officials in June confirmed one man in New York had become the first ever to contract the infection via sex in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He previously travelled to England, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/greece/index.html" id="mol-f6f8f4b0-f5d3-11ef-bdc6-fd5222969046"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-8f4154b0-f5d4-11ef-bdc6-fd5222969046" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, and said he had sexual encounters during his trips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While not fatal, TMVII can leave sufferers with permanent scarring or pigmentation on areas of the skin that were infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The New York researchers warned the rashes experienced by people infected with this type of ringworm may also present differently than the more common ringworm and could be mistaken for eczema, leaving patients without relief for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr David Denning, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Manchester, told MailOnline it was 'very likely that there are undetected cases' in the UK, 'particularly those in the early stages'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Today if you had a rash on your chest or your back, you might not bother to deal with it for a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you were to go to a doctor and they prescribe something like a steroid or antibacterial cream but it doesn't work, we could be looking at six to eight weeks since it began. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'It's likely no more transmissable than other skin fungi but it is very inflammatory meaning you get a much worse rash and usual treatments don't work.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts also cautioned 'very long waiting lists' for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-8f3ac500-f5d4-11ef-bdc6-fd5222969046" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; dermatology treatment and 'long waits' for PCR test results could see at risk patients waiting weeks before the infection is confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — The Texas Department of Health and Human Services has released the latest number of measles cases confirmed as the state continues to battle an outbreak in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday morning, the state reported that 146 cases in nine counties have been identified since late January. Twenty of the patients have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest update comes two days after the &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles/texas-measles-death-outbreak-lubbock/285-636380ac-1d18-4404-999d-b804f40137af" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;first death was reported&lt;/a&gt; in a school-aged child who lived in the outbreak area. Officials said the child was not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak has been the largest in the state in &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-mmr-vaccine-homeschooling-b29d08d53cf26704968e8c00dfa712ba"&gt;nearly 30 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state and Lubbock health officials confirmed the death to The Associated Press. The child wasn't identified but was treated at Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock, though the facility noted the patient didn't live in Lubbock County.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a big deal,” Dr. Amy Thompson, a pediatrician and chief executive officer of Covenant Health, said Wednesday at a news conference. “We have known that we have measles in our community, and we are now seeing a very serious consequence.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In federal response, RFK Jr. appears to misstate several facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s top health official and a vaccine critic, said Wednesday that the U.S. Department of the Health and Human Services is watching cases and dismissed the Texas outbreak as “not unusual.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He appeared to misstate a number of facts, including a claim that most who had been hospitalized were there only for “quarantine.” Dr. Lara Johnson at Covenant contested that characterization.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t hospitalize patients for quarantine purposes,” said Johnson, the chief medical officer.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also seemed to misspeak in saying two people had died of measles. A spokesman — Andrew Nixon, for the Department of Health and Human Services — later clarified that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified only one death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government is providing vaccines as well as technical and laboratory support in West Texas, but the state health department is leading the response, Nixon said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC has said it will provide only weekly updates on the measles outbreak, and had not yet updated its public webpage to reflect the child’s death. Texas health department data shows that a majority of the reported measles cases are in children.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In rural Texas, some patients have needed oxygen or intubation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus has largely spread among rural, oil rig-dotted towns in West Texas, with cases concentrated in a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-vaccinations-mennonites-4880035d6fd53cc029b531f5adda95ad"&gt;“close-knit, undervaccinated” Mennonite community&lt;/a&gt;, state health department spokesperson Lara Anton said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaines County, which has reported 80 cases so far, has a strong homeschooling and private school community. It is also home to one of the highest rates of school-aged children in Texas who have opted out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% skipping a required dose last school year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20 measles patients have been hospitalized at Covenant, including the outbreak's first identified case, hospital officials said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some patients' respiratory issues progressed to bacterial pneumonia, and they needed an oxygen tube to breathe, Johnson told The Associated Press. Others had to be intubated, though Johnson declined to say how many due to privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, like so many viruses, there aren’t any specific treatments for measles,” she said. “What we’re doing is providing supportive care, helping support the patients as they hopefully recover.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said through a spokesman that his office is in regular communication with the state health department and epidemiologists, and that vaccination teams are in the “affected area.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The state will deploy all necessary resources to ensure the safety and health of Texans,” said spokesman Andrew Mahaleris, calling the child's death a tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later Wednesday, the state health department confirmed a new measles case in Rockwall County, east of Dallas. The person had traveled internationally and is not related to the West Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccines are safe and effective, and measles was once considered eliminated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing infection and severe cases. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccinations-kindergarten-exemptions-cdc-1c0f9a196a70491fccf48b9125090de0"&gt;95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners&lt;/a&gt; — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/childhood-vaccines-schedule-kennedy-trump-hhs-4d5e6c52c602f5edbcd837748605e9d0"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; vowed to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule that prevents measles, polio and other dangerous diseases, despite promises not to change it during his confirmation hearings.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. had considered measles — a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours — eliminated in 2000, which meant there had been a halt in continuous spread of the disease for at least a year. Measles cases rose in 2024, including a Chicago outbreak that &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-chicago-migrant-shelter-cdc-e58517c830f73e42266d45d45983c12b"&gt;sickened more than 60&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current outbreak, Lubbock’s first case was in an unvaccinated child who sat in an emergency room with a kid who had measles, said Katherine Wells, director of the local health department, calling it a testament to how quickly the virus spreads.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you see it in real life, you really realize how contagious it is,” said Wells, noting she expects more local cases, with a couple under investigation as of Wednesday. “An entire household gets sick so quickly. Whole families are getting sick with measles.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Akiko Iwasaki, the lead researcher behind the paper, told MailOnline she understands the pre-print, which was not peer-reviewed but published on website MedRxiv, could be seen as controversial &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One told MailOnline they had developed persistent tinnitus six-hours after their third Covid jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I spent over 12 months on an NHS audiology waiting list, only to be dismissed and told it was merely a coincidence due to my part-time work as a sound engineer,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added how the constant tinnitus, which can take the form of ringing, buzzing or hissing, now dominated his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I struggle with sleep, frequently need to ask people to repeat themselves, and find that the only way I can concentrate at work is by constantly listening to music to drown out the incessant noise,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many who contacted this website he said he had felt 'coerced' into getting the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If I didn't get them, I would have been fired, as there was no place for me in the small office with non-existent social distancing. Being a new starter, I felt I had no choice but to comply,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of the patients who suspect they have PVS told MailOnline directly that were not against vaccines in general, noting that they have saved countless lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2022 study led by academics at Imperial College London suggests almost 20million lives were saved by Covid vaccines in the first year since countries began rolling out the jabs, the majority in wealthy nations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they added that a general failure from experts to acknowledge their experiences of adverse reactions had eroded trust in the health system, an attitude that could put the success of future vaccine programmes at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PVS is still a poorly understood condition, with even the Yale experts who unveiled their findings emphasizing the research is 'still a work in progress'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, the team collected blood samples of 42 Americans with PVS and 22 without it, between December 2022 and November 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with the syndrome were generally in poorer health than the average American, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most complaining of the symptoms developed them after their first or second Covid vaccine, with some experiencing an onset after a third or fourth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with PVS also had elevated levels of Covid spike proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The levels in PVS patients were even greater than those found in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14255465/doctors-relief-long-covid-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;patients with long Covid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a condition with similar symptoms linked to the virus itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It should also be noted that many of the PVS's symptoms are relatively common ailments and can be caused by numerous conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As such, there is currently no way to prove if they are caused by a vaccine or are simply unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Akiko Iwasaki, the lead researcher behind Yale paper, told MailOnline she understands the pre-print, which has not yet peer-reviewed by independent experts, could be seen as controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she added that they will keep studying the condition in an effort to bring affected patients 'better transparency and safer vaccines.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Independent experts, however, have urged for caution over the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing on X, Dr Adam Gaffney, an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Harvard University, also said: 'There's nothing wrong with studying vaccine side effects. There is a problem with this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're at a moment right now where the US government is undercutting people's trust in science and vaccinations probably like never before in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And to coin this novel syndrome without even proving that it's caused by the vaccine is very worrisome to me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid jabs, like any vaccine or medical product, can cause side effects which can vary in frequency and severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But mRNA vaccines are estimated to have saved tens of millions of lives globally from Covid, 1.6million in Europe and 3million in the US alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are also credited with helping end the series of paralyzing lockdowns brought on by the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no figures for the number of PVS patients in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, newly released data show 18,551 claims for compensation for injuries and deaths they believe to be caused by Covid vaccines have been made in Britain as of last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These figures relate to the Government's Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It predates the Covid shots and offers some victims of vaccine injuries and deaths a one-off payment of £120,000 (about $150,000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, only just over 200 of these claims have been deemed eligible for the sum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has been widely criticised for requiring patients to be at least 60 per cent disabled by their injuries in order to qualify for a payout — for example losing a limb, a sense like your sight, or complete paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the 11,000 with an outcome about 450 were dismissed because while medics agreed a person had been injured by the jab, the case did not meet the 60 per cent disability and therefore the applicant got nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The remainder were unsuccessful because assessors found that, on the balance of probabilities, their injury or condition had not been caused by a Covid vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A further 7,000 or so applications are still awaiting an outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Within days, two of her cats had to be euthanized, and a third was in an intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All of the cats that had eaten raw pet food would later test positive for bird flu. Only a male cat kept apart from the others and fed canned food stayed negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Knopp is an artist in Portland, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/oregon" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, who breeds and shows Cornish Rex cats. She has fed raw food to all but the male cat for years, and watched recent notices about tainted raw pet food carefully. She believed the food from Wild Coast was being tested for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I’ve since learned, I don’t think there’s really a safe way to trust if someone says they’re testing it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Wild Coast did not respond to the Guardian’s media inquiries about why the company &lt;a href="https://wildcoastpets.com/wild-coast-safety-steps-for-h5n1/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;waited a week&lt;/a&gt; to issue a voluntary recall after being notified of possible contamination, and whether it was reaching out to vendors and customers about the recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;If Knopp had known, she would have “immediately” switched to canned food – a move she now recommends to all cat owners who were feeding raw food they bought or made on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It is not safe,” she said. “Immediately: do not feed raw poultry or raw chicken, raw any table scraps, to cats currently – not even raw eggs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Raw milk is similarly risky, since milk can contain enormous amounts of virus, and raw beef has also been found to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/18/usda-dairy-cows-bird-flu-survey" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;harbor H5N1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Especially right now, feeding raw food is just all risk,” said Steve Valeika, a small-animal veterinarian with a public health background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;H5N1 joins a host of other pathogens – including salmonella, &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt;, campylobacter, listeria and toxoplasmosis – that have been associated with raw pet food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One of the most unnerving parts for Knopp: her cats never displayed the classic symptoms of respiratory infections, like congestion. Some of the cats had fevers, rapid breathing and eyelid swelling, and one eventually had difficulty walking – a sign of neurological impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But nothing pointed to influenza until X-rays revealed two of the cats with rapid breathing had developed severe pneumonia. That’s when they tested for bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Your average person probably wouldn’t take them to the vet with a minor fever that comes and goes,” Knopp said. “Your average person might not notice a sudden increase of breath rate, especially for a cat that’s maybe more reclusive. So I wonder how many cases are also under-reported.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Knopp was concerned that she might become infected and spread the virus herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-19" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-19" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;after newsletter promotion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I don’t want to be known as ‘Bird Flu Mary’,” she said. Her local health department conducted daily symptom check-ins, she started wearing face masks when she went out in public, and she requested a test to see if she had gotten sick. The result was negative for influenza A and B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In 2016, cats in a New York City shelter &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6986351/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;transmitted&lt;/a&gt; H7N2 to at least one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We know that cats can at least transmit another strain of bird flu directly to people,” Valeika said. “I do think these cats potentially present some risk to humans. We don’t have any idea how big that risk is, but it’s definitely one that should be taken seriously until we know better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It is not clear how tainted poultry is entering the raw pet food supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All facilities processing meat for humans are inspected by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While some meat intended for pets flows through FSIS-inspected facilities, “obviously, a great deal of protein is produced outside of FSIS-inspected facilities and is never intended for human consumption”, said Eric Deeble, deputy under-secretary for marketing and regulatory programs at the USDA, on 16 January during the last call health officials held with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;US officials were investigating whether any of the H5-positive pet products had gone through such a facility, he said, though no results have been released to the public yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Birds from affected flocks that are depopulated as part of USDA’s efforts to control H5N1 are not permitted in any food product at all,” Deeble said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Valeika added that he had “no good idea as to why we’re seeing so many sick birds making it into the [pet] food supply – because this must just be the tip of the iceberg”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There are other steps pet owners can take to protect animals, and themselves, from bird flu, Valeika said: don’t let cats outside, and don’t let dogs hunt or play with birds, including in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19081209/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ponds and lakes&lt;/a&gt; frequented by migratory birds. Mice and rats, especially near dairy and poultry farms, have also tested positive for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Knopp has been posting about her experiences and holding “ask me anything” sessions about cats and bird flu on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I’ve channeled a lot of grief into work and into education,” she said. For the two cats who were euthanized, she said, “their death gets to mean something. It can save other animals. It can save some people grief.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE40MTFSRWJWcWpQOUJqS0l3aWJET05rUElwNDZqWml3cS13VFkxRDZwSjJLX2pDYnNKYkc3ekhRbXdGQTJyclFOSFNTbE9DbWlfc3RsVWZ2VGItbWFvSHBtYzZRUklUbmRCTklKUE5n</guid></item><item><title>Exclusive | CrossFit-loving dad, 42, gets transplant after flu-like symptoms turn out to be end-stage heart failure - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQRmR4dGhXRy1tNjVXYUtwMF9uWWNjX2NnTFRkd2E4SnN6MXdSM3JWZXQxQkNqMDU3V2pNX2E5WVF0SEgycGx1N2RLaXI3NXd5Q0FOZjdxWldjcWdOSy1PRXlEMFNQcmE0OUd0RjRmYV9zazZSaGFTNllpSUxkeEJ2TWJzMDFHSC1jaVlWTWhuRGtlRGQtdFdTUE9VWVFGY2xYWDBHUW5ISmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;A New York City dad who suffered sudden heart failure and nearly lost his life is sharing his story of survival after a successful heart transplant, encouraging all men to “go to the doctor right away if you feel like something’s off — life is too precious to sit idly by.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nycmuseumgallery.org/1248/news/time-for-a-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/a&gt; was a 40-year-old CrossFit-loving fitness buff and school principal enjoying summer vacation when something suddenly went terribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The father of two was with his kids in his native Portugal in August 2023 when he experienced alarming flu-like symptoms he had never felt before. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I just felt very sick — I never coughed as violently — it hurt,” Rodrigues, now 42, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rodrigues’ flu-like symptoms turned out to be signs of heart failure. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At five-foot-11 and 175 pounds, Rodrigues should have been the portrait of health in the prime of his life — a clean eater who took pride in exercising with an at-home rower. But he became a shell of himself as months went by without one good day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was shocking — there was no warning,” he said. “It came on fast and furious.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He sought answers from six different doctors “to try to get to the bottom of what was happening.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the array of antibiotics and nasal sprays for a diagnosis of pneumonia and an upper respiratory infection didn’t cut down the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The physical change was dramatic as he hit 190 pounds due to the fluid retention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What I noticed was completely abnormal,” said Rodrigues, adding that discovering the appearance of abnormally swollen ankles made him fear it was a heart issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After two months of mysterious symptoms — including constant shortness of breath and exhaustion — Rodriguez darted for the Mount Sinai ER, where he stayed for 12 days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of a cold or respiratory virus, he learned that it was severe heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rodrigues was a a clean eater who took pride in exercising with an at-home rower when he got sick. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There were a lot of really scary nights in the hospital,” he said, adding that “not seeing my kids grow up was my worst thought. It’s still my worst thought and fear.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said it was myocarditis, a condition &lt;a href="https://news.yale.edu/2023/05/05/yale-study-reveals-insights-post-vaccine-heart-inflammation-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;increasingly associated with young males&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-024-00893-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Covid shot&lt;/a&gt;, which led to his heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The cause of the myocarditis is unknown,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since he had no family history of it and “genetic testing cleared me of [anything],” the doting dad felt grateful that he wouldn’t pass it down to his son and daughter, ages 9 and 11.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HIs heart was functioning at 10%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The term they use is end-stage heart failure,” he said, noting that the normal rate is 50% or higher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But under the care of Mount Sinai’s Dr. Anuradha Lala, he tried a variety of medications aimed at improving function of the heart and minimizing the rate at which his heart was deteriorating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;He learned he was in end-stage heart failure, with his heart functioning at just 10%. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Though genetic testing yielded ”no genetic basis” for his condition, the doctor told The Post. “We don’t know the exact reason that Andre had heart failure. But to me, his journey is about recognizing symptoms, knowing when to ask for help, attuning your mind to your body and coming to terms with being sick.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Building trust and a personal connection is so critical — especially for younger folks, who may just want to run away from the issue,” added Dr. Lala, Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant Cardiologist at the Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He worked closely with his team, had regular blood work and various tests done under therapeutic care, but there was no improvement. Other organs, including kidney and liver, were affected because they weren’t getting enough healthy oxygenated blood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surviving for his kids was his biggest motivation. “I was motivated to play soccer with them again and run around with them and they kept me really motivated” to get through this ordeal, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But by the fall of 2024, he needed to pivot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;He had no family history it and “genetic testing cleared me of [anything].” He was at lead glad he wouldn’t pass it down to his son and daughter, ages 9 and 11. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My heart could not bounce back and I needed to be put on the transplant list” while in Mount Sinai’s ICU and an impella was used to help his left ventricle pump.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Under the care of a team that included cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Anelechi Anyanwu, Rodrigues matched with a viable heart and underwent a successful eight-hour surgery in late October.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back at his Museum School in Chelsea, Manhattan, staff and students sent hundreds of emails and letters of support for the fourth-year principal, who forced himself to let go of his fears and put his complete faith in his team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though he doesn’t know much about his donor, he’s grateful for the “gift” that gave him life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By early January, Rodrigues was ready to return to his beloved school, where staff and students lined the hallways to welcome him back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a wonderful community where students show so much empathy — towards one another and to me,” he said of the emotional reunion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rodrigues was ready this January to return to his beloved school, where he is the principal. Staff and students lined the hallways to welcome him back. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The future remains bright for Rodrigues, who noted life will be different “but also beautiful at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;And, yes, that includes CrossFit in his future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The road is still long, but nothing compared to what he was on,” added Dr. Lala, who urged the public not to write off anything that feels worrisome. “The intention isn’t to promote fear, but to instill awareness, around symptoms that should prompt further evaluation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rodrigues’ message to others is to seek medical help if something feels off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is your life. This is your life and life is too precious to sit idly and not have a proper diagnosis. And even when the diagnosis is scary, trust the medical professionals and move forward with courage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Have a positive mindset and trust the medical professionals. Keep advocating for yourself and your health.”&lt;/p&gt;

A growing body of research highlights the role &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/common-mineral-supplement-may-help-prevent-cold-and-flu-symptoms-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and minerals play in preserving cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a groundbreaking study suggests that magnesium intake could be a key factor in keeping the brain healthy and lowering dementia risk. Researchers are uncovering how this essential mineral might help slow cognitive decline, offering a simple yet powerful strategy for brain preservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-023-03123-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;European Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed data from the UK Biobank, a large-scale health database. Researchers focused on magnesium consumption and its potential impact on brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Dietary Mg intake trajectories in men and women corresponding to different subgroups of individuals identified by latent class analysis.

To estimate their daily magnesium intake, researchers used a dietary questionnaire administered five times over a 16-month span. This method allowed for a detailed assessment of each participant’s typical &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3tfwgXi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were striking. Individuals consuming more than 550 milligrams of magnesium daily had “brain ages” nearly a year younger by the time they reached 55. In contrast, those consuming the average intake of about 350 milligrams showed more typical patterns of brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study lead author Khawlah Alateeq, Ph.D., from the &lt;a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ANU National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health&lt;/a&gt;, highlighted the significance of these results. “Our study shows a 41% increase in magnesium intake could lead to less age-related brain shrinkage, which is associated with better cognitive function and a decreased risk or delayed onset of dementia in later life,” she stated in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alateeq also emphasized magnesium’s potential as an early intervention for brain health. She noted, “This means people of all ages should be paying closer attention to their magnesium intake.” Her statement underscores the importance of dietary choices long before cognitive decline becomes a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also indicated that the brain-protective benefits of increased dietary magnesium were more pronounced in women—especially those post-menopause—than in men. Alateeq theorizes that this might be attributed to magnesium's &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-explore-bioengineering-vegetables-with-anti-inflammatory-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-inflammatory properties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_vital_role_of_magnesium_in_our_diet"&gt;The Vital Role of Magnesium in Our Diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is magnesium, and why is it crucial for our brain's health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melissa Prest, D.C.N., R.D.N., a prominent national media spokesperson for the &lt;a href="https://www.eatright.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics&lt;/a&gt;, explains that magnesium, found abundantly in nuts, seeds, dairy, and leafy greens, plays a critical role in maintaining our body tissues. This includes the essential task of nerve signaling in the brain and preserving the blood-brain barrier's integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Dr Erin I.

As Prest elucidates, low magnesium levels have previously been associated with a heightened risk of brain inflammation and the onset of diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s, and multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Prest sheds light on the intricate relationship between magnesium and menopause, which might explain the gender-based differences observed in the study. “High magnesium intake in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-study-suggests-that-breastfeeding-may-help-prevent-cognitive-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;post-menopausal women&lt;/a&gt; correlates with reduced inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein, indicating reduced inflammation,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="optimizing_daily_magnesium_intake"&gt;Optimizing Daily Magnesium Intake&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults' magnesium needs can fluctuate based on factors such as age and biological sex, typically ranging from 310 to 420 mg/day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Bar graph of the associations (beta values) between dietary magnesium (Mg) trajectories and a the brain volumes including gray matter, white matter, left hippocampus, right hippocampus, and white matter lesions; and b blood pressure (BP) including mean arterial pressure (MAP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP) stratified by sex.

Before starting any supplement, consulting with a healthcare professional is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_bigger_picture_on_brain_health"&gt;The Bigger Picture on Brain Health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the potential of magnesium in brain health is promising, it's essential to understand the broader picture.

        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) today announced the &lt;a href="/publications/m/item/recommended-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2025-2026-northern-hemisphere-influenza-season"&gt;recommendations for the viral composition of influenza vaccines for the 2025-2026 influenza season in the northern hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement was made at an information session at the end of a 4-day meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines, a meeting that is held twice annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO organizes these consultations with an advisory group of experts gathered from WHO Collaborating Centres and WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories to analyse influenza virus surveillance data generated by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). The recommendations issued are used by the national vaccine regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce, and license influenza vaccines for the following influenza season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The periodic update of viruses contained in influenza vaccines is necessary for the vaccines to be effective due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses, including those circulating and infecting humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO recommends that &lt;strong&gt;trivalent &lt;/strong&gt;vaccines for use in the 2025-2026 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Egg-based vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;an A/Croatia/10136RV/2023 (H3N2)-like virus; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cell culture-, recombinant protein- or nucleic acid-based vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;an A/District of Columbia/27/2023 (H3N2)-like virus; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommendation for the B/Yamagata lineage component of quadrivalent influenza vaccines remains unchanged from previous recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;As an outbreak of measles &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309800/texas-measles-child-death-vaccination" target="_blank"&gt;continues to spread&lt;/a&gt; in west Texas and New Mexico, many people are wondering, how bad could it get?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Well, the first thing to know is that measles is one of the most contagious diseases on Earth — more than Ebola, smallpox or just about any other infectious disease. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Before widespread vaccination eliminated the disease in the U.S., pretty much everyone got measles in childhood. And 400-500 children used to die from it each year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the vaccine's power to beat back measles outbreaks starts to crumble when vaccination rates drop low enough. We asked scientists to help us decipher how lower vaccination rates can affect spread and what that means for the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The math of measles spread&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To understand just how easily measles spreads, it helps to know a scientific concept known as the basic reproduction number, or R naught. That's the number of people, on average, that a single infected person can transmit a disease to.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The R naught for measles ranges from 12 to 18. In other words, if one person is infected, they will infect as many as 18 others on average. That's much higher than with other infectious diseases, such as Ebola with an R naught of 2.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, R naught is a theoretical number. "It's not some magical constant," says &lt;a href="https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/justin-lessler-phd/" target="_blank"&gt;Justin Lessler&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It assumes that &lt;a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/when-will-it-be-over-an-introduction-to-viral-reproduction-numbers-r0-and-re/#:~:text=The%20effective%20reproduction%20number%2C%20Re%2C%20sometimes%20also%20called%20R,and%20also%20as%20people%20die." target="_blank"&gt;no one has immunity to a given disease&lt;/a&gt;. That's what the "naught" refers to, as in zero immunity. It's useful for comparing the infectious potential of different diseases. But in the real world, a lot of different factors can alter how easily measles transmits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This brings us to a concept known as the&lt;em&gt; effective&lt;/em&gt; reproduction number. That's the number of people that a sick person can infect in a given population at any specific time. It changes as more people become immune through infection or vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It also changes depending on how people behave. Do infected people isolate? Are vulnerable, unvaccinated people clustered together, socializing with each other? That kind of situation "gives an opportunity for the virus to exist in a place," Lessler says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And, the most effective firewall against transmission is vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The graphic below shows how much a lower vaccination rate can affect measles' spread in a theoretical group of kindergartners who cluster together every weekday in a classroom.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;If a disease has a reproduction number under 1, infections will spread slowly and an outbreak will eventually die out, because each infected person spreads it to fewer than one other person on average.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the flipside, here's where exponential case growth can happen. Let's say a measles outbreak has an effective reproduction number of 3, like in the graphic above. That might not sound so bad, until you consider that those three people can go on to infect three others, and so on and so on. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In fact, the original strain of the virus that causes COVID had a reproduction number of around 3, and we all saw how that went, says &lt;a href="https://www.huck.psu.edu/people/matthew-ferrari" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of biology and the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Penn State University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's not unreasonable to think that measles could spread as fast as [pre-vaccine] SARS-CoV-2 in populations, particularly in school settings, where kids are vaccinated at 80-85%," Ferrari says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Vulnerable Texas counties&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The kindergarten vaccination rate for measles in Gaines County, the epicenter of the current outbreak in Texas, is just below 82%. That's well below the 95% vaccination rate threshold needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Nationwide, measles vaccination rates have been falling for years and are currently at 92.7%. In some communities, kindergarten vaccination rates are much lower, creating pockets of opportunity for measles to spread.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;About half of the counties in Texas have a kindergarten vaccination rate below that 95% threshold. In Foard County, Texas, the rate stands at just under 67%. In a classroom with that vaccination rate, one infected child would infect five other unvaccinated classmates with measles on average.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;You can find even lower vaccination rates if you drill down to the school level. One private school in Fort Worth, Texas, reported a kindergarten vaccination rate of just over 14%. That's not to say the outbreak will reach places like this, but if it did, they'd be very vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lessler says many factors will determine how far this outbreak spreads and how big it gets. That includes how many people get vaccinated in response to the outbreak, whether suspected cases are quarantined, and how well contact tracing works so exposed people don't infect others.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And that's critical, because a person infected with measles can be contagious from four days before the telltale measles rash appears, until four days after, says &lt;a href="https://www.childrens.com/doctor-profile/carla-garcia-carreno" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric infectious disease specialist with Children's Medical Center Plano in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So you can be spreading it without knowing you have the measles," Carreno says. A person with measles can emit infectious particles that linger in the air for up to two hours, long after they've left the room. "That's what makes it also difficult to control."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Lessler says in conditions where under-vaccinated people are grouped together — such as the close-knit rural community &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/first-measles-death-reported-in-west-texas-outbreak-thats-infected-more-than-120-people" target="_blank"&gt;where the current outbreak is largely spreading&lt;/a&gt; — measles has the potential to cause reasonably sized outbreaks. But he thinks the firewall provided by higher vaccination and immunity levels in the broader population will eventually tamp down the  outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Are we at risk of getting, like in the old days, thousands or tens of thousands of cases from this outbreak? That's probably pretty unlikely," Lessler says. "The [vaccination] firewall is still pretty strong at that sort of broad level."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But if measles vaccination rates continue their downward trend amid &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/12/06/nx-s1-5218574/rfk-vaccines-anti-vaccine-infectious-disease" target="_blank"&gt;rising anti-vaccine sentiment&lt;/a&gt;, he says the days when measles outbreaks involve thousands of cases could return within the next five to 10 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Gynaecology&lt;/a&gt;, then discovered the teen had no vaginal opening, a rare defect that only affects between 4,000 to 10,000 newborn girls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, this should have made it impossible for the teen to get pregnant without technologies like in vitro fertilization (IVF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition, called vaginal atresia, also made it impossible for her to give birth through her vagina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meant doctors had to perform a C-section to deliver the baby, which turned out to be a healthy 6.2lb boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case, which dates back to 1988, has recently resurfaced, following a &lt;a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/health/14160094/found-out-pregnant-going-into-labour-mum-minutes-later/" rel=""&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; of a Scottish woman who thought she had a burst appendix, only to discover she was pregnant - and gave birth 40 minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, medics treating the girl in Lesotho were puzzled as to &lt;span&gt;how the teen had become pregnant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl claimed that in the months leading up to the birth, she noticed her body changing shape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because she did not have a vaginal opening and had not engaged in penetrative vaginal sex, she “did not believe she was pregnant".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors learned that nine months before she had attended hospital for a stab wound to her stomach region shortly after giving oral sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="bc-video-6346858965112" class="brightcove"&gt;&lt;p class="brightcove__holder lazyload"&gt;&lt;video data-account="5067014667001" data-player="lYPa0anAF" data-video-id-pending="6346858965112" data-brightcove-id="video_6346858965112_5067014667001-193433" id="video_6346858965112_5067014667001-193433" data-application-id="Inline" controls="" class="brightcove__video" playsinline=""&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="recommended-videos-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="article__bc_video-caption"&gt;Dr Philippa Kaye answers the web’s most EMBARRASSING women’s sex questions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that time, she confided in a nurse that her ex-boyfriend had violently attacked her in was described as a "mini war" when he caught her giving oral sex to a new partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts decided the sperm she swallowed somehow made its way to her reproductive organs through her stab wounds, leading to the unexpected pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that the son resembled the father excluded it as an even more miraculous conception," they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this pregnancy even more surprising is that stomach acid is usually strong enough to kill sperm quickly, making it unable to fertilise an egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical team’s most "plausible" explanation is that the sperm survived because the girl had no food in her stomach at the time of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They believe this lowered the acidity in her stomach, allowing the sperm to travel through her stab wounds and reach her uterus, where it fertilised the egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-boxout"&gt;&lt;p class="article-boxout__header t-p-background-color"&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color"&gt;Other bizarre medical case reports&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The US Sun</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 11:08:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQcVNaUzhQczlsUW5sYWZLZDRhZFdVVFY4S2tEazBqVHpHYkswbUhnYlJCV3BXVC1MTG5rQnRaYmtuYnhMbmpFVHRZQnhyTElNcHgxTnduVU10MXVJY1RZTENLS3pWMDJlM2ZTZlg5QTlLZW1Sc2lkX3dnenlYbVdZVlMtZk9OSXhiM2JB</guid></item><item><title>Woman's Mysterious Burning Feet Traced to Worms in Her Brain - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxQelllSTlQYlI2N1hwSWgtRi1uR2hRaGZaTktTcC11ZmFCbGdaZTdLM01Pam1Jdm5WT1BHT3cwVHJtUjNkc3RaRUlmUU9DNXNoWktqZ1hQOUVwOVJyUmRCZXFDMVRBVFhZTHg0dkxDc1c3UDRnMWg3SFpXQWR3ZHUzWlp0aEZQNTNmdk1aUThSb2NVdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A 30-year-old woman in the United States was told by doctors she had parasites in her brain after presenting to the hospital with a burning sensation in her feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worms seem to have been unlucky souvenirs the &lt;span&gt;woman &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;unknowingly  picked up while traveling in Thailand, Japan, and Hawaii. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embedded in her central nervous system, the quiet invaders didn't 'make a peep' until 12 days after the woman had returned home. Only then did their presence cause an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4312175/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;intense immune response&lt;/a&gt; that took a further week to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over several days, hot pain in the woman's feet crawled up her legs, trunk, and arms, before erupting in a splitting headache that even frequent doses of pain relief medication couldn't alleviate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Ul1QjBYxQU?start=122&amp;amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An initial visit to the emergency department turned up only a mild increase in disease-fighting white blood cells. But after days of unrelenting discomfort and a mild  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="153305" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;, the woman returned to a different hospital looking for answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following treatment with intravenous anti-inflammatories and an anti-anxiety medication called lorazepam, her headache finally abated and she was discharged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once again, the symptoms persisted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, when the woman woke, she began to pack for a vacation that she had not planned. Her roommate noticed her strange behavior and encouraged her to lie back down in bed. Hours later, when the woman was still showing signs of confusion, her partner took her to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The development of confusion in this patient with sensory symptoms, headache, and possible intermittent fever suggests the possibility of encephalitis and further increases concern about a central nervous system infection," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412514?logout=true"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; infectious disease specialist Joseph Zunt from the University of Washington.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing her blood, her doctors found no sign of parasites, and a CT scan of her head showed no red flags beneath her skull. Yet when medical staff performed a lumbar puncture, they found the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which bathes the brain and spinal cord, contained markers of &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/meningitis/eosinophilic-meningitis"&gt;eosinophilic meningitis&lt;/a&gt; – a rare form of brain infection that can be caused by parasites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the patient's recent travel and her symptoms, her doctors agreed she met the criteria for a presumptive diagnosis of angiostrongyliasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This insidious disease is also known as &lt;a href="https://www.biisc.org/pest/rlw/"&gt;rat lungworm &lt;/a&gt;because it is caused by the parasite &lt;i&gt;Angiostrongylus cantonensis&lt;/i&gt;, which starts its life cycle in the lungs of a rodent before spreading to slugs and snails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people aren't &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-australian-man-died-eight-years-after-eating-a-garden-slug-in-a-dare-gone-wrong"&gt;eating uncooked slugs or snails&lt;/a&gt;, but if we bite into a &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/rat-lung-worm.aspx"&gt;fresh, leafy vegetable&lt;/a&gt; that one of these creatures has slimed, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7887556/"&gt;parasite's larvae&lt;/a&gt; can end up in our bodies without us knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's one of the reasons why washing green produce is so important when staying in parts of the world &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/rat-lung-worm.aspx"&gt;where rat lungworm spreads&lt;/a&gt;, including Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Australia. Undercooked crab or prawns can also be a vector, as these animals eat slugs and snails, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153319" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153319" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/nejmcpc2412514_f1-642x845.jpg" alt="Rat Lungworm Cycle" class="size-medium wp-image-153319" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/nejmcpc2412514_f1-642x845.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/nejmcpc2412514_f1-315x415.jpg 315w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/nejmcpc2412514_f1-768x1011.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/nejmcpc2412514_f1-1167x1536.jpg 1167w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/nejmcpc2412514_f1-1556x2048.jpg 1556w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/nejmcpc2412514_f1-600x790.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153319" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Life cycle of &lt;em&gt;Angiostrongylus cantonensis&lt;/em&gt; and symptoms of infection.

&lt;p&gt;Only occasionally are the larvae able to be seen in the brain for a definitive diagnosis. Usually, brain scans &lt;a href="https://www.ajnr.org/content/21/6/1090"&gt;only hint&lt;/a&gt; at damage from these parasites. The image below, for instance, shows clear signals of lesions in parts of a 32-year-old's brain that are indicative of angiostrongyliasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153338" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153338" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/F1.large_-642x209.jpg" alt="Parasite Brain Markers " class="size-medium wp-image-153338" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/F1.large_-642x209.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/F1.large_-1024x333.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/F1.large_-768x250.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/F1.large_-600x195.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/F1.large_.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153338" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A 32-year-old man with areas of fuzzy hyperintense signal in parts of his brain due to angiostrongyliasis.

The patient was also given a high dose of a steroid called prednisone to help alleviate inflammation in her brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her symptoms abated with the combination treatment, and on her sixth day in hospital, she was able to go home &lt;span&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;this time without hidden passengers in her brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412514?logout=true"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

State officials told TPR they have not confirmed a case of either type of illness at the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legacy Traditional School - Cibolo said in a statement provided to TPR around 6:30 Thursday evening that the school was "taking all necessary precautions following the confirmation of a measles case in a first-grade classroom." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement was provided by the charter school's management company, Vertex Education. However, a letter that appears to have been sent to parents used the terms measles and rubella interchangeably. Rubella is sometimes called German measles, but it is not the same illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TPR contacted Sean Amir with the charter management company seeking clarification, and Amir told TPR the case was actually rubella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubella doesn't typically make kids as sick as measles can, but it poses a threat to women in the first trimester of pregnancy. It can cause miscarriage or stillbirth. Children are typically vaccinated against rubella, measles, and mumps at the same time when they get the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“School officials are working closely with state and local public health authorities to monitor the situation and ensure the well-being of the school community. School will remain open on Friday, Feb. 28, and as an added precaution, a thorough sanitization of the campus will take place after school hours,” school officials said in the original statement provided to TPR. “Families who have been directly notified should continue to follow the guidance provided. We appreciate our community's patience, trust, and cooperation as we navigate this situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State and local health officials have not confirmed the illness reported by the school. A spokesperson for the state health department &lt;a href="https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2025/02/28/state-health-officials-say-no-measles-case-at-cibolo-charter-school/" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;told KSAT News&lt;/a&gt; Thursday no measles case had been confirmed in the area. Texas Department of State Health Services spokesperson Chris Van Deusen provided the same statement to TPR.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are no confirmed cases in that area. Just because someone is being tested for measles doesn’t mean they have measles," Van Deusen said in an email. "There are a lot of different illness that cause a rash, and we want people to be thinking about measles, and we want doctors who see a patient with a rash that could be measles to have them tested. But at this point, no confirmed cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Deusen later told TPR his department has not confirmed a case of either measles or rubella in the San Antonio area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas health officials will update the statewide count of confirmed measles cases Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;County health officials notified the public of a &lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/public-health/2025-02-23/breaking-news-possible-measles-exposures-in-san-antonio" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;potential measles exposure in the San Antonio area on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, but it is unclear if that exposure is connected to the possible measles case at Legacy Traditional School – Cibolo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccination status of the person the school said has rubella is also unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce the risk of spreading measles, community vaccination rates need to be at 95% or higher. Dozens of San Antonio-area schools &lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/education/2025-02-25/dozens-of-san-antonio-schools-have-low-measles-vaccination-rates" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;are below that threshold&lt;/a&gt;, including Legacy Traditional Schools. 94.5% of Kindergartners at Legacy had received the MMR vaccine last year, placing it just under the level required for herd immunity. Other San Antonio schools have much lower vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;According to medical experts&lt;/a&gt;, the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is 97% effective against measles once a person has received two doses. Texas requires school-aged children to be vaccinated against measles, but families are able to request exemptions for both medical and conscientious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday&lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/bioscience-medicine/2025-02-25/state-reports-west-texas-measles-outbreak-cases-now-at-124" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;, 124 cases of measles had been confirmed in Texas&lt;/a&gt; by state medical experts, primarily in West Texas in and around Gaines County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, state and local officials reported that &lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/2025-02-26/a-child-has-died-in-the-texas-measles-outbreak" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;a school-age child had died&lt;/a&gt; of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly infectious among the unvaccinated, and causes fever, rash, and respiratory symptoms. It can also lead to more serious complications like pneumonia and swelling of the brain, which can sometimes be fatal. Young children and people who are immunocompromised are most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person can become sick up to 21 days after exposure, and the virus at first appears much like another respiratory illness. Tiny white spots may appear inside the mouth after two or three days, followed by a rash on the face, head, and body that lasts for five to six days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An infected person is contagious up to four days before the rash appears and four days after the rash appears, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bonnie Petrie contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I was a fit and healthy 32-year-old doctor who follows a good diet and exercises regularly - and suddenly I was living a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ghalili pictured above (left) as a doctor and while healing from his injuries (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After researching my symptoms, I realized they had been caused by a common antibiotic Ciprofloxacin - known as Cipro - that I had prescribed to patients myself countless times for urinary tract infections, persistent coughs, and skin infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I'd taken the drug to help treat a stomach infection and hadn't thought anything of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after just three doses taken twice a day, my body betrayed me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I was aware the drug could cause side effects, but my medical training had led me to believe they would be minor and subside in a few days. This couldn't be further from the truth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ciprofloxacin is part of a common class of medications called fluoroquinolone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than five million Americans are prescribed this class of antibiotic every year - yet most are completely unaware of the serious, and sometimes life-altering, complications they can cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs are subject to three black box warnings from the FDA - the most severe warning the drug agency can place on a medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2016 - shortly before I took Cipro - the FDA recommended that fluoroquinolone drugs should only be used as a 'last resort.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a notice, the agency said the antibiotic should only be used for patients with sinusitis, bronchitis or UTIs when there were 'no other treatment options' available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was because the 'risk of these serious side effects generally outweighs the benefits in these patients'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet despite the FDA recording more than 60,000 injuries linked to fluoroquinolones from the 1990s to the end of 2015, countless cases go unrecognized or misdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ghalili is pictured above with HHS secretary nominee Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As I desperately sought answers for myself, I found an online community of thousands of people suffering the same debilitating side effects. Their stories became my lifeline, confirming I was not alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the worst side effects I experienced was the impact on my brain receptors, which plunged my body in a relentless state of fight-or-flight - that felt like a psychological nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients who experience severe reactions to these medications call it being 'floxed'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms can be immediate, as in my case, or emerge weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most antibiotics work by targeting structures in the bacteria, such as its cell wall, to weaken and kill the pathogen in order to eradicate the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has shown fluoroquinolones, however, attack bacterial DNA and damage human mitochondrial DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since mitochondria are the energy producers of our cells, the damage may cause them to produce less energy, which disrupts many of the normal functions of cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To recover, I realized I needed to repair my mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To do this, I replenished magnesium in my body, taking more than 2,000 milligrams (mg) per day in the beginning to help restore my tendons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I also took supplements to reduce my body's oxidative stress. This is when there are too many free radicals - highly reactive unstable molecules - in the body that are damaging cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ghalili is pictured above using his wheelchair, which he was forced into after Cipro left him unable to use his legs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ghalili is pictured above receiving experimental stem cell therapy that he says healed him&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Determined to heal, I also explored regenerative therapies and the turning point came in February 2017 when I received a groundbreaking stem cell treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My doctor, the late Dr Mark Berman, who pioneered stem cell surgery in America, extracted tissue from my abdomen, isolated stem cells, and re-injected them into my abdomen in an attempt to revive my body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I was completely awake throughout the procedure, with the stem cells injected just below the skin. It wasn't painful but the treatment did take several hours to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stem cells have the unique ability to self-renew and develop into many different types of cells so can regenerate damaged tissues. They can also contain undamaged mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amazingly, it worked. And with the help of supplements, I began to regain my strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within weeks, I was standing and walking again. And against all odds, I made what I believe to be a near-total recovery from Ciprofloxacin toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today, I am healthier than ever and completely recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But my horrendous experience transformed my perspective on medicine.  I no longer work in a hospital and now focus on helping patients through regenerative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ghalili has now set up a clinic that aims to help others who say they were injured by ciprofloxacin (two patients pictured above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'I would never prescribe Ciprofloxacin again because of the harm it could do to patients'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Determined to help make a difference, I founded &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://regenerativemedicinela.com/"&gt;Regenerative Medicine LA&lt;/a&gt;, a clinic dedicated to treating individuals injured by fluoroquinolone antibiotics, as well as those suffering from autoimmune diseases, vaccine injuries, neuropathy, dementia, Parkinson’s, MS, and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I also launched &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://regenlabs.com/"&gt;Regen Labs&lt;/a&gt;, a biohacking supplement line offering natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Knowing what I know now, I would never prescribe Ciprofloxacin again because of the harm it could do to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Through my clinic, I am committed to helping others heal and ensuring no one else endures what I went through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medical community must do more to recognize the dangers of fluoroquinolones and exercise extreme caution before prescribing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I survived, I recovered, and now, I fight for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;As told to Luke Andrews, health reporter at DailyMail.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 07:14:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNY2ZEODduRnpjWkl2SjBSMXkxRV9sR2pKemg3c0VmU2VESzhjMGlhVXFiZzFHTndya3hXYU9yWXJyZTZ0eGpzZHpQR3pHcEdLQkx0Q2RjVWx6blRLbzJQVGpDMllhd3JzaHI5aWlrUEtjNERlemtjUXA1UzlIVzYtMUVZOU9SWU9BRGZkVWN0cXhacmFRQzlF</guid></item><item><title>HPV vaccine that RFK once called "dangerous" credited for precancerous lesions rate plunge -

&lt;p&gt;Nearly 1,100 people have fallen ill, with 60 deaths being confirmed, as health officials work to determine the cause of the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to the World Health Organization (WHO).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health authorities in the DRC, along with WHO experts, are investigating three clusters of illness and community deaths in the country’s Equateur province, according to a Thursday &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/democratic-republic-of-congo/news/democratic-republic-congo-deepens-investigation-cluster-illness-and-community-deaths-equateur"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; from WHO’s Africa Region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,096 cases and 60 deaths have been identified through increased disease surveillance, the update stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Symptoms identified under the broad case definition for increased disease surveillance include fever, headache, chills, sweating, stiff neck, muscle aches, joint pain, body aches, nasal bleeding or discharge, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bnone-in-content-4" id="bnone-1735467090"&gt;&lt;div class="advert-block"&gt;
	&lt;span class="mvp-ad-label"&gt;Article continues below the player&lt;/span&gt;
	
	&lt;p data-fuse="22691751352"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most recent cluster emerged in the Basankusu health zone, where 141 people fell ill last week, though no deaths were reported. Earlier in February, the same health zone recorded 158 cases and 58 deaths. In January, the Bolamba health zone reported 12 cases, including 8 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initial laboratory tests have ruled out Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus disease, according to the update. Approximately half of the samples tested positive for malaria, which is common in the region, with further tests planned for meningitis. Food, water, and environmental samples will also be analyzed to assess possible contamination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health experts from the DRC and WHO have been deployed to the affected areas to investigate any unusual patterns and to provide treatment for diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, and meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://bnonews.com/index.php/2025/02/unknown-disease-kills-53-and-infects-hundreds-in-drc/?swcfpc=1"&gt;earlier update&lt;/a&gt;, WHO Africa Region reported that preliminary investigations traced the initial cluster’s origin to three community deaths among children under five in Boloko Village between January 10 and 13. Reports indicated that the children had consumed a bat carcass before developing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The WHO Africa Region report raised concerns over the high mortality rate, the rapid progression of the illness, and the risk of further spread. However, it also noted that the lack of epidemiological links between affected health zones may indicate separate health events.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Very few painkillers are safe to use during pregnancy, and yet one of the only available options has become embroiled in an international debate in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is generally considered to be the safest painkiller to use during pregnancy, and yet emerging research that has linked the drug to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="153066" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="153066" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;) suggests there may be overlooked risks to early brain development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a small new study, researchers in the US tracked bloodstream levels of acetaminophen in 307 Black women during their pregnancy. They found those who used acetaminophen later gave birth to children more than three times as likely to receive an ADHD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For daughters, exposure to acetaminophen in the womb was linked to a more than six-fold increase in the risk of ADHD within the first ten years of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cBDOx85Ywck?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that sounds concerning on the surface, these initial results are not conclusive and should not scare off the large percentage of people who rely on acetaminophen during pregnancy for pain or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="153066" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;. Especially since robust evidence shows both of those symptoms can be &lt;a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aogs.14557"&gt;threats&lt;/a&gt; to a developing fetus if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any medicine, the benefits of acetaminophen must be balanced by the risks. Unlike its pros, however, the long-term cons are not as well researched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This medication was… approved decades ago, and may need reevaluation by the FDA," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/child-adhd-risk-linked-to-mothers-use-of-acetaminophen"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; pediatrician Sheela Sathyanarayana from UW Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Acetaminophen was never evaluated for fetal exposures in relation to long-term neurodevelopmental impacts."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, several other epidemiology studies have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41574-021-00553-7"&gt;found associations&lt;/a&gt; between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and ADHD outcomes in children, and yet some studies have produced &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406"&gt;conflicting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyt183"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;. All of these investigations are purely correlational and their findings are not a cause for alarm, some scientists &lt;a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/newsroom/news/2021/09/take-care-with-paracetamol-when-pregnant-but-dont-let-pain-or-fever-go-unchecked"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt;, but rather, alertness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the current study's small sample size, the data are probably not robust enough to change the minds of officials at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine – all of whom maintain that acetaminophen poses minimal risk when using the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9047911/"&gt;lowest dose&lt;/a&gt; as needed during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the current study does not account for factors "like the mother's reason for taking [paracetamol], such as headaches or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="153066" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fevers&lt;/a&gt; or pains or infections, which we know are risk factors for adverse child development," statistical geneticist Viktor Ahlqvist from Sweden's Karolinska Institute, who was not involved in the current research, &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2467761-using-common-painkiller-in-pregnancy-might-raise-adhd-risk-in-children/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Grace Wade at &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153079" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153079" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/p548-t4-642x325.gif" alt="AAFP" class="size-medium wp-image-153079" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/p548-t4-642x325.gif 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/p548-t4-821x415.gif 821w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/p548-t4-768x388.gif 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/p548-t4-1536x777.gif 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/p548-t4-600x303.gif 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/p548-t4.gif 1952w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153079" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Safety of over-the-counter drugs for pain.

&lt;p&gt;The last time the FDA did so was in &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-has-reviewed-possible-risks-pain-medicine-use-during-pregnancy"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;, when officials declared there was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjpain.2017.09.007"&gt;inconclusive evidence&lt;/a&gt; to connect acetaminophen use in pregnancy and ADHD in children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most of the prior studies asked women to self-report whether they had taken Tylenol or anything that contained acetaminophen," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/child-adhd-risk-linked-to-mothers-use-of-acetaminophen"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Baker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2753512"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2770802"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; (one led by Baker) measured acetaminophen levels in newborns and found that higher levels of the painkiller were linked with ADHD in childhood. One of these also found a link to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="153066" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="153066" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ASD&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of this initial data, an international team of 91 scientists, clinicians, and public health professionals came together to urge 'precautionary action'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[Acetaminophen] is an important medication and alternatives for treatment of high fever and severe pain are limited," they &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41574-021-00553-7"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a Consensus Statement for &lt;i&gt;Nature Reviews Endocrinology &lt;/i&gt;in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We recommend that pregnant women should be cautioned at the beginning of pregnancy to: forego acetaminophen unless its use is medically indicated; consult with a physician or pharmacist if they are uncertain whether use is indicated and before using on a long-term basis; and minimize exposure by using the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the 2021 commentary, officials at ACOG held firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Neurodevelopmental disorders, in particular, are multifactorial and very difficult to associate with a singular cause. The brain does not stop developing until at least 15 months of age, which leaves room for children to be exposed to a number of factors that could potentially lead to these issues," they &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-articles/2021/09/response-to-consensus-statement-on-paracetamol-use-during-pregnancy"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"ACOG's clinical guidance remains the same and physicians should not change clinical practice until definitive prospective research is done."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study on 307 pregnant people that needs to be replicated again is probably not going to cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The conflicting results means that more research is needed," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/child-adhd-risk-linked-to-mothers-use-of-acetaminophen"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Baker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-025-00387-6"&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="story_dl"&gt;Feb. 27 (UPI) --&lt;/span&gt; A measles outbreak in Canada's Ontario province continues to grow, with health officials reporting more than 140 cases on Thursday, making it the most severe outbreak in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Health Ontario said in &lt;a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/Documents/M/24/measles-ontario-epi-summary.pdf?rev=da3ffec26cc0471f83ed9de3ca356e1c&amp;amp;sc_lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;an update&lt;/a&gt; that so far this year, it has seen a total of 119 confirmed and 23 probable cases of the highly infectious disease, with all but two associated with an ongoing multijurisdictional outbreak that began in the fall.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The officials have traced the outbreak back to a travel-related case in New Brunswick on Oct. 18. While the maritime province has since declared its outbreak over, Ontario continues to battle transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 177 cases have been reported in Ontario going back to October, but infections have spiked since the middle of last month.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A breakdown of the cases shows that 141 patients are 19 years of age of younger. Among children and adolescents, 97.9% were unimmunized. Eighteen of the cases have required hospitalization, including one case that needed intensive care, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 90% of the cases are in the jurisdictions of Southwestern Public Health and Grand Erie Public Health&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak is an anomaly in Ontario where measles cases are generally rare.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the province saw between seven and 22 cases a year, Public Health Canada said, with 101 confirmed cases reported between 2013 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, there were 37 cases associated with the ongoing outbreak, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak in Ontario continues to grow as Texas battles one of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Texas health officials &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2025/02/26/Texas-measles-outbreak/5901740543998/" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; their first death to measles since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The school has not responded to KENS 5's follow-up questions Thursday evening. The spokesperson had said in a statement that the school would be open Friday and a "thorough sanitization of the campus" conducted. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are no confirmed cases in that area," DSHS officials said in an email. "Just because someone is being tested for measles doesn’t mean they have measles. There are a lot of different illness that cause a rash, and we want people to be thinking about measles, and we want doctors who see a patient with a rash that could be measles to have them tested."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How a measles case would be reported to DSHS depends on where a potentially diagnosed staff or student member lives. If they resided in Bexar County, a confirmed case would first be reported to Metro Health. If they lived in Guadalupe County, the school would have the burden of reporting directly to the state, DSHS said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Friday, the Texas Department of State Health Services was &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;reporting 124 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt;, mostly in the South Plains region of West Texas. Most of them affected unvaccinated children, although five people who are vaccinated have been among the cases, according to health officials. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KING COUNTY, Wash. — The first case of measles in Washington state this year has been identified in a King County infant. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County was notified of the confirmed case Wednesday and said the infant was possibly infected during recent travel abroad. Officials released a list of dates and locations where the infant was in the last few days. Anyone who was there in that timeframe could have been exposed to measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feb. 20 from 6-9 p.m.: Apple Store at Bellevue Square&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feb. 21-22 from 10:30 p.m. to 2:15 a.m.: Seattle Children's Hospital Emergency Department at Sand Point Way NE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feb. 24 from 1-4:15 p.m. Allegro Pediatrics in Bothell&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feb. 25 from 1-4 p.m.: Northwest Asthma &amp;amp; Allergy Center&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feb. 25 from 2:30-5:30 p.m.: Seattle Children's Hospital Emergency Department at Sand Point Way NE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anyone who was at the locations at the times listed above and is not immune to measles will &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;most likely become sick between Feb. 27 – and March 18.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infant was likely not fully vaccinated because the first dose of the rubella (MMR) vaccine is typically administered between the ages of 12 to 15 months and children are eligible for the second dose at 4 years old. Infants and young children are at risk for severe disease from measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles, mumps and MMR vaccine provides about 97% protection against getting infected by measles and that protection lasts a lifetime, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes days after an unvaccinated child in Texas died from measles. It was the first measles death in the country since 2015. Measles has now been reported in at least 10 states. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does this compare to last year?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, King County saw three confirmed measles cases. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to health officials, due to the current vaccination rate in the county it is likely there will be more frequent and larger breakouts of the highly infectious disease. Herd immunity, which helps prevent rapid spread of diseases among a large population, requires about 95% of people to be vaccinated against measles. According to King County records, 87% of 2-year-olds in the county are up to date on the MMR vaccine, and an estimated 72% of 4 to 6-year-olds have received a total of two doses of the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington state as a whole is seeing a decline in childhood vaccination rates as well. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/article/news/health/childhood-vaccination-rates-decline-inwashington-state-why-doctors-matters-everyone-healthlink/281-59219502-43eb-441a-b568-024ff895dede" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Data from &lt;/a&gt;the Washington state Department of Health's (DOH) school immunization data &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/data-and-statistical-reports/washington-tracking-network-wtn/school-immunization/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt; shows the percentage of enrolled K-12 students receiving complete immunization decreased from about 92.6 percent in school years from 2020 to 2021, down to 90.8 percent in the 2023-2024 school year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among kindergartners, the decline was slightly sharper, with 90% receiving complete immunization in the 2019-2020 school year down to 87% in 2023-2024.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Measles symptoms&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads through the air and is highly contagious, according to the Center for Disease Control. Measles has a characteristic rash; it is red and flat, and it first appears on the face. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, other initial symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes. Tiny white spots may appear inside the mouth two to three days after those symptoms begin and before the distinct rash forms. The rash usually begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline. They then spread downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups who are most likely to experience severe symptoms include children under age 5, pregnant people and people with weakened immune systems or underlying chronic conditions, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Those most susceptible to measles are pregnant women, immunocompromised people and those who haven’t been&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;vaccinated against it — including young children, since kids are normally given their first dose at 12 to 15 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TKCGNVCAUVEQXDD4DDWX7HGGLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Thanks in large part to widespread use of the measles vaccine, the disease&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;was considered to be eliminated from the United States in 2000, meaning it&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;had not spread domestically for more than 12 months. However, since the height of the covid&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/measles-outbreak-risk-in-us.html#:~:text=U.S.%20population%20susceptibility%20to%20measles,the%202020%2D2021%20school%20year." target="_blank"&gt;measles vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; for kindergarten-age children have decreased, according to the CDC.

&lt;p&gt;Folks may experience difficulty producing speech or finding the right words, Amin said. Words may come out slurred or jumbled, to the surprise of the speaker and their loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A TIA is an emergency, and anyone who experiences it should get medical attention right away. The good news is that “the risk of having a stroke can be decreased dramatically with targeted treatment,” explained Goldstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors can run scans of the brain and blood vessels, evaluate heart function, and screen for cardiovascular risk factors that increase the risk of stroke, according to Amin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Treating conditions like plaque in the arteries, heart arrhythmias, hypertension, diabetes and others can dramatically lower the risk of a future stroke, which could lead to significant disability or even death,” he noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mini-stroke-signs-symptoms_l_660d9427e4b09f580bc65ff5" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7827001"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Usually this may happen on one side of your body, said Dr. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fanikanayak%2Fmini-stroke-signs-symptoms-sc&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lmhospital.org%2Fphysicians%2Fhardik-amin&amp;amp;xcust=7827001%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hardik Amin;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Hardik Amin&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of neurology and medical stroke director at Yale New Haven Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss Of Vision &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person examining a pill bottle with a thoughtful expression, wearing a scarf and a sweater, highlighting focus on medication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Individuals may also experience “loss of vision in one or both eyes, or double vision,” Goldstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This doesn’t necessarily mean seeing nothing. Double vision, also known as diplopia, is when you may see two images of a single object while looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Face Drooping Or Numbness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An older woman in a blue shirt gently touches her face with a content expression, promoting skincare or self-care in a Goodful context&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another symptom is facial drooping, or losing muscle control on one side of your face. You may experience numbness, and it may be difficult to smile or move parts of your mouth. This can look similar to Bell’s palsy, a condition that causes the same type of facial paralysis. Though a stroke will typically lead to other symptoms as well, it’s still important to get checked immediately even if this is the only issue you’re experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arm Weakness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person in a white shirt gently holding their wrist, seated at a desk, suggesting a moment of reflection or mindfulness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Goldstein, arm weakness is another possible warning sign of a TIA. Lifting objects and holding up your arms may feel like difficult tasks, especially when you haven’t had trouble doing these things before.

&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., head of the Department of Health and Human Services, downplayed the seriousness of an ongoing measles outbreak in Texas, falsely claiming that people had been hospitalized “mainly for quarantine” and misleadingly stating that the situation is “not unusual.” The Texas outbreak is already larger than any single outbreak last year and has led to the first measles death in the U.S. since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfigf-zGdjA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;remarks&lt;/a&gt; on Feb. 26 were his first public comments about the outbreak, which appears to have already spread to New Mexico. During a Cabinet meeting, a reporter asked President Donald Trump whether he was concerned, given &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/R8XT-4XUB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the day that an unvaccinated school-aged child had died from the viral disease. Trump asked Kennedy, who was in the room, to respond.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kennedy, Feb. 26: &lt;/strong&gt;We are following the measles epidemic every day. I think there’s 124 people who have contracted measles at this point, mainly in Gaines County, Texas. Mainly, we’re told, in the Mennonite community. There are two people who have died. We’re watching it, and there are about 20 people hospitalized, mainly for quarantine. We’re watching it, we put out a post on it yesterday, and we’re going to continue to follow it. Incidentally, there have been four measles outbreaks this year in this country. Last year, there were 16. So it’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy made no mention of vaccination. During an outbreak, offering measles vaccines to susceptible people is an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6207419/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;important strategy&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/R8XT-4XUB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;limit the spread&lt;/a&gt; of measles, which is one of the most contagious diseases. Vaccination shortly after a measles exposure can also prevent illness or reduce the severity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A measles vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;first became&lt;/a&gt; available in the U.S. in 1963. By 2000, the disease was declared eliminated, meaning measles has not been continuously spreading for a year or more in a single area. Prior to a measles vaccine, there were 3 million to 4 million cases &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;each year&lt;/a&gt; in America, with 48,000 hospitalizations and 400 to 500 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has a long &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.factcheck.org/2023/08/scicheck-factchecking-robert-f-kennedy-jr/"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of sharing inaccurate information about vaccines, including the measles vaccine. He &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/AaronBlake/status/1894792427388498329/photo/1"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a forward to a 2021 book that Americans have been “misled … into believing that measles is a deadly disease and that measles vaccines are necessary, safe, and effective.” He added that measles outbreaks “have been fabricated to create fear” to “inflict unnecessary and risky vaccines on millions of children.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As recently as last month, while denying any responsibility for a deadly outbreak of measles in Samoa in 2019, Kennedy &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-samoa-measles-kennedy-vaccines-pacific-42a9cb583c71f165699b16710884c474"&gt;falsely&lt;/a&gt; said during a &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.rev.com/transcripts/rfk-jr-confiramation-hearing-day-one"&gt;confirmation hearing&lt;/a&gt; that “most” of the people who died in the outbreak didn’t have measles and “we don’t know what was killing them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several of Kennedy’s Cabinet meeting comments are incorrect or misleading. Only one death, not two, has been reported. Children were hospitalized because they needed treatment, not “mainly for quarantine.” And while Kennedy is correct that last year there were more outbreaks than there have been so far this year, that leaves out significant context.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We were unable to identify any Feb. 25 posts from HHS or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about measles. A day after Kennedy’s remarks, however, the CDC posted a &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/723P-AZLZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on the outbreak, saying: “Vaccination remains the best defense against measles infection.” The agency said it “continues to be in close communication with Texas health authorities about the measles outbreak in West Texas, following the death of a child. HHS sends its deepest condolences to the family.” The measles death is the first in a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/woman-dies-measles-first-us-death-12-years-n385946" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt; and the first death of a child from measles in the U.S. since &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5331a3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked about the death toll discrepancy, any posts and whether Kennedy was encouraging measles vaccination, Andrew G. Nixon, HHS’ director of communications, told us in an email on Feb. 26, “CDC is aware of the death of one child in Texas from measles, and our thoughts are with the family.” He added that the agency “continues to provide technical assistance, laboratory support, and vaccines as needed” to the health departments in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services also confirmed the single death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are aware of one death associated with the outbreak,” Lara M. Anton, a senior press officer for the agency, told us in an email.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of Feb. 25, there were &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;124 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; of measles in Texas since late January, including 18 patients who have been hospitalized, according to state health officials. All but five cases have occurred in people who are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. Cases have been concentrated in and around Gaines County, a rural county with a large Mennonite population and &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lower&lt;/a&gt; measles vaccination rate. More than 100 of the cases have been in children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nine other measles cases, none of which have required hospitalization, have been reported in New Mexico as of Feb. 25, &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; the state’s health department. Officials suspect measles spread from Texas, as all the cases have occurred in a county bordering Gaines County, but the origin of the spread has &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/vaccine/2025/2/?view=2180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;not yet&lt;/a&gt; been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;False Hospitalization Claim&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not true, as Kennedy said, that the measles hospitalizations were “mainly for quarantine.” He likely meant to say isolation, which &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/answers/public-health-and-safety/what-is-the-difference-between-isolation-and-quarantine/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;refers&lt;/a&gt; to separating people who are sick from those who are healthy to prevent the spread of a disease. Quarantine refers to the separation of people who have been exposed but are not yet showing symptoms. But in either case, he’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="alignright size-full"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/measles-story.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-268562" srcset="https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/measles-story.jpg 400w, https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/measles-story-217x145.jpg 217w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Photo by weerapat1003 / stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“People in the hospital are there because they need treatment,” Anton told us. “We are not quarantining anyone in the hospital. People who are not vaccinated and have been exposed are asked to isolate at home.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paul A. Offit&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us the hospital is the “last place” someone with the measles should go, unless they need care, due to the extreme contagiousness of measles and its relatively high complication rate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You do everything you can to keep measles out of the hospital because it’s a highly contagious virus and there’s a lot of vulnerable children in the hospital who are immunosuppressed and can’t be effectively vaccinated,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lara Johnson, a pediatrician and the chief medical officer at Covenant Children’s Hospital, the hospital in Lubbock, Texas, that is caring for kids with measles, including the child that died, said in an &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-dies-measles-west-texas-outbreak-rcna193812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a Feb. 26 &lt;a href="https://www.wcjb.com/video/2025/02/26/watch-lubbock-officials-give-briefing-measles-death-west-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt; that all of the hospitalized children had been admitted because of breathing issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t hospitalize patients for quarantine,” she also said, noting that the hospital provides &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/covenant-health-hospital-lubbock-confirms-000220735.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;supportive care&lt;/a&gt;, including supplemental oxygen and medicine for fevers. No measles-specific treatments &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/01/scicheck-posts-mislead-about-measles-mmr-vaccine-amid-recent-outbreaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;exist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Johnson and other hospital officials said during the briefing that their children’s hospital had admitted “about 20” kids for measles, all of whom were unvaccinated. “Several” required intensive care. In addition, a “handful” of children with measles had been seen at the emergency room, but did not need further hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Summer Davies, a doctor who cared for the child who died from measles, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/26/measles-texas-unvaccinated-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Washington Post that the child who died had developed heart problems and was put on a ventilator. The child, she said, had been previously healthy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;Misleading Claim on Significance of Outbreak&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is correct that the U.S. typically has at least a few measles outbreaks each year, and that last year there were 16. According to the CDC, there were &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://perma.cc/W6DF-42FZ"&gt;285 measles cases in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, with 198 of those cases being outbreak-related. An outbreak is defined as three or more related cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, as of Feb. 20, CDC had recorded a total of 93 cases, 86 of which had occurred in three outbreaks. (Those statistics are now out of date, as just Texas and New Mexico together have at least 133 cases.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the comparison — and the suggestion that this is all par for the course — is misleading. Not only should outbreaks be rare, experts say, but 2024 was a relatively bad year for measles. And the current outbreak has several features that make it particularly concerning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Offit called Kennedy’s statement that the U.S. has measles outbreaks every year “a little glib … as if this is acceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We eliminated measles from this country by the year 2000. With a two-dose vaccine, we eliminated the most contagious disease,” Offit said. But in part because of false information that Kennedy himself has put out for several decades, he said, a critical percentage of parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children, making outbreaks possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most parents vaccinate their children, but measles is so contagious that 95% of a community needs to be vaccinated or have prior immunity to prevent spread of the disease. A single dose of the measles vaccine is 93% &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effective&lt;/a&gt; in preventing the disease and two are 97% effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although Kennedy suggests last year’s outbreaks were normal, 2024 had the &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/W6DF-42FZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fourth highest&lt;/a&gt; tally of confirmed measles cases in the U.S. since 2000. Only 2014, 2018 and 2019 were higher. The latter two &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6817e1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; included outbreaks in Orthodox Jewish communities in New York. In 2019, such outbreaks contributed to an annual total of more than 1,200 cases, making it the worst year for measles since 1992. 2014 is when there was a large outbreak at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6406a5.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Disneyland&lt;/a&gt; in California, which also caused cases in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The current outbreak, notably, is already larger than any single outbreak in 2024 — and is still growing. Health officials in &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; both say that additional cases are “likely.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The other concerning detail is the measles death, which, as the first pediatric measles death in 22 years, is highly unusual, and has occurred after only about 124 cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Offit said the typical death rate from measles is about 1 in 1,000. It could be a fluke, but such a high death rate at this point in the outbreak could mean that it is much bigger than is being recognized.&lt;/p&gt;

Kim Schrier (D-Wash.) tore into Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for downplaying a child’s death in a measles outbreak in Texas, saying she blames Kennedy for the tragedy because of his long record of spreading disinformation about vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;State health officials &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-west-texas-death-rfk-41adc66641e4a56ce2b2677480031ab9" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="confirmed Wednesday" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c0a705e4b0702663293e54" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-west-texas-death-rfk-41adc66641e4a56ce2b2677480031ab9" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;confirmed Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that an unvaccinated child in rural West Texas had died amid the outbreak, becoming the first U.S. death from measles since 2015. Measles is highly contagious but preventable with vaccines. Asked later in the same&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;day about the unnamed child’s death during the first Cabinet meeting of President Donald Trump’s new administration, Kennedy said only that measles outbreaks are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rfk-jr-dismisses-measles-outbreak_n_67bf5519e4b053f9e3997f53" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="“not unusual”" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c0a705e4b0702663293e54" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="67bf5519e4b053f9e3997f53" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“not unusual”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and that “we have measles outbreaks every year.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Schrier, who is a pediatrician, said she was stunned by Kennedy’s response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“He’s full of, you can put four letters there,” she told HuffPost. “Starts with an ‘S.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The fact that a child has died from a vaccine-preventable disease is “devastating,” Schrier said. “And by the way, I do blame him and others like him who, for the past 20 years, have been spreading lies about vaccines, which are safe and effective.

			&lt;p&gt;The progress of a human being through life might be thought of as a mostly gradual succession of changes from the ovum to the grave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you wake up one morning, look in the mirror, and wonder when you suddenly grew so much older, you may not be imagining things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to recent research into the molecular changes associated with aging, humans experience two drastic lurches forward, one at the average age of 44 and the other at the average age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're not just changing gradually over time; there are some really dramatic changes," geneticist Michael Snyder of Stanford University &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in August 2024 when the study was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It turns out the mid-40s is a time of dramatic change, as is the early 60s. And that's true no matter what class of molecules you look at."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging is complex, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-could-be-caused-by-brain-cells-that-age-too-fast"&gt;associated with growing risks of diseases&lt;/a&gt; of all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IGEEHb6gTy8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder and his colleagues have been investigating the biology of aging to better understand what changes occur and how, in order to better mitigate and treat these ailments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, they have been tracking a group of 108 adults, who have been donating biological samples every few months over several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They noticed that in&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-021-09910-5"&gt; some conditions&lt;/a&gt;, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="152619" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2308-3425/6/2/19"&gt; cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, risk doesn't rise gradually with time, it escalates sharply after a certain age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they wanted to take a closer look at the biomarkers of aging to see if they could identify related changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_132987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132987" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors.jpg" alt="An older male squatting with outstretched arms in a park" class="wp-image-132987 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132987" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The molecular changes associated with aging show that humans experience two drastic lurches forward. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEI-V1gZcw/"&gt;MixMedia/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the samples from their cohort, the researchers have been tracking different kinds of biomolecules. The different molecules studied include RNA, proteins, lipids, and gut, skin, nasal, and oral microbiome taxa, for a total of 135,239 biological features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each participant submitted an average of 47 samples over 626 days, with the longest-serving participant submitting 367 samples. This wealth of data resulted in more than 246 billion data points, which the researchers then processed, looking for patterns in the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several previous studies have found non-linear changes in molecular abundances that can be linked to aging in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(19)31091-5"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0673-2"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of fruit flies, mice, and zebrafish have also pointed to a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging/articles/10.3389/fragi.2024.1378351/full"&gt;stepwise aging process in those species&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snyder and his colleagues noticed that there's a very clear change in the abundance of many different kinds of molecules in the human body at two distinct stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 81 percent of all the molecules they studied showed changes during one or both of these stages. Changes peaked in the mid-40s, and again in the early 60s, with slightly different profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mid-40s peak showed changes in molecules related to the metabolism of lipids,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="152619" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, and alcohol, as well as cardiovascular disease, and dysfunctions in skin and muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early 60s peak was associated with carbohydrate and caffeine metabolism, cardiovascular disease, skin and muscle, immune regulation, and kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first peak, the mid-40s, is typically when women start undergoing menopause or perimenopause, but the researchers ruled this out as a main factor: men, too, also underwent significant molecular changes at the same age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that while menopause or perimenopause may contribute to the changes observed in women in their mid-40s, there are likely other, more significant factors influencing these changes in both men and women," &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html"&gt;explained metabolomicist and first author Xiaotao Shen&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of Stanford, now at Nanyang Technological University Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Identifying and studying these factors should be a priority for future research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144095" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144095" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1.jpg" alt="A young woman's face next to an older woman's face, both are smiling" class="size-full wp-image-144095" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144095" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Changes peaked in the mid-40s, and again in the early 60s.

&lt;p&gt;Future research could help delve further into this phenomenon, studying it in more granular detail, across a wider range of subjects, to better understand how the human body changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00692-2"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in August 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infant visited several King County public locations before the diagnosis, potentially exposing others. Measles can spread before symptoms appear, and the virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential exposure sites include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency is urging  those who may have been exposed at these locations to verify their vaccination status, and to a consult a healthcare provider if they develop a fever or rash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most symptoms of measles appear between 7 to 21 days after someone has been exposed, Public Health said. Some symptoms include a high fever that can last two to four days, cough, runny nose, pink eye, and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three medical facilitates listed above are notifying patients and families who may have been exposed, providing information about the exposure date and disease symptoms to watch for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A patient who came to the Seattle Children’s Emergency Department tested positive for measles," a Seattle Children's spokesperson said in a statement to KOMO News Thursday. "Emergency Department staff members followed appropriate screening processes of the patient and their family members at the visit and quickly implemented appropriate infection control procedures, which include isolating the patient and reporting to King County Public Health. We are notifying patients and families in the Emergency Department who may have been exposed, providing information about the exposure date and disease symptoms. For privacy reasons, we do not share information about specific patient cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can be confirmed with a sample of blood or saliva in a lab. The best way to prevent the spread of measles is by making sure you are up to date on the MMR vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid possibly spreading measles to others, do not go to a clinic or hospital without calling first to tell them you want to be checked for measles after an exposure. It is also important to limit contact with others, especially those without known immunity, and to wear a well-fitting mask if you do need to go to a healthcare facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/child-dies-measles-texas-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-deadly-illness-rfk-jr-department-state-health-services-snohomish-county-health-department-doh" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/child-dies-measles-texas-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-deadly-illness-rfk-jr-department-state-health-services-snohomish-county-health-department-doh" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Child dies in measles outbreak in Texas as Washington officials urge vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most likely period for symptom onset is Feb. 27 to Mar. 18  for those exposed and not immune. Measles is contagious from about four days before a rash appears through four days after a rash appears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health also emphasized the importance of the measles vaccine for the community at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles is easily spread from person to person. If one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected," said Dr. Eric Chow, Communicable Disease Chief for Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County. "We are seeing increases in measles cases within and outside the US. Talk to your doctor about checking your vaccination status and get vaccinated now if you aren’t already protected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency explained the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is highly effective, with two doses providing about 97% protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herd immunity requires approximately 95% vaccination coverage due to measles' high contagion rate. Currently, an estimated 87% of 2-year-olds and 72% of 4–6-year-olds in King County are up to date with their MMR vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, King County reported three measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information about measles and measles vaccination, including where to get measles vaccinations, can be found on King County's &lt;a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/measles" target="_blank" title="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/measles" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WEBSITE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can measles be fatal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It usually doesn’t kill people, but it can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven’t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis — which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s deadly “in a little less than 1% of cases, mainly in children,” said Scott Weaver, who works at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. “Children develop the most severe illness. The cause of death in these kinds of cases is usually pneumonia and complications from pneumonia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you need a booster if you got the MMR vaccine a while ago?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care professionals are sometimes tested for antibodies to measles and given boosters if necessary, Weaver said — even if they’ve already had the standard two doses as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may also want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I don’t think everyone needs to go and run out to their doctor right now if they did receive two doses as a child,” he said. "If people would just get the standard vaccination, none of this would be happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 23:45:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2wJBVV95cUxQYjBDOEZIckVIUktZOE1QaWpGREl1VzEtbXFPUlFwbHBZRDlILXk3ZUwwYVRudnV2b2M0VkVWYjRjSm1pZkdvYy1BdUFERU5uUUp5OHBZaVZSaVhXcE80QjdQaFdXVFpsTlo4RFlPT3dsb2JDNVFzQ2pzZlFnSFBJOWd4eUNUY0xjQVU2RFNOcHZqTGVkT2djOEZna2g2QmpDMUtlM21kbjY5VXJqZE44TGFqdnhhelQyTUh1aGIxdWl0bnYzbUoxU0ZWTnVmbW9VOHJ4UXNBc1J2UFpQbkdhRUJoZmVTdmNzZ3hvWUp5WUU2VFhlSkhmclNBeXlmWHZBaHoxNXVjenJpUHc0ZlVqV0JTWWl1NUtzbERWck9kcEdQZDUwb0ZuX0Rfei1YS01MSG45ODJNdEd1MnRkOXdrYmVNdTN4dWVFOVNRdER0RTloUnBXTDAzM1dTdw</guid></item><item><title>First measles case confirmed in San Antonio area from first-grade classroom, school says - KENS5.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi6gFBVV95cUxOR1A0YVpmbklLSldfbnc4N182Q0NBN2FTSE9oNnlCMVZqZlZyLWY1N3lHbGozazBMMUp2SjVnQXRKTWpOTl90RVNwSnlMQzRuWlZncDZnOHFWU2x5Q210Nlg3b0g1V2dCQUdpR1hLcXlLci1rSTRDS1R5a3pneU5tbnFCRFlmWGJfa2Q0TGlNV2dFQlZmWFNFXzVzeFUyX000c2p6cUlWUnluSjdXNUc2VmVRTXE3V0ZuM2ZQTEFjUWxoc2JKZDJQU3U5cnUzM19Hb3A5WTQ1Qy1tRzh0ak44N01WWUJQVGRMR2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;The Legacy Traditional School in Cibolo has confirmed with KENS 5 that there is a measles case in a first-grade classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

Vaccine exemptions among children in Gaines County, the epicenter of the outbreak, have grown dramatically in the past few years. Roughly 7.5% of kindergarteners had filed an exemption for at least one vaccine in 2013. 10 years later, that number rose to over 17.5% – one of the highest in all of Texas, state health data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As the response to the outbreak in Texas and New Mexico continues, with cases expected to significantly rise, public health experts like Hotez and Offit say they're watching Kennedy, as leader of the nation's health department, to encourage swift surveillance and widespread vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"I want him to say to the American public that there's a safe way to prevent these outbreaks from happening so that we don't have the tragedy like what just happened in West Texas," Offit said. "There's so much in medicine you don't know. There's so much we can't do. This we know.

UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washoe County School District is reporting a return to five schools on outbreak status and an increase to 23 classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five schools were initially reported on Tuesday before the number jumped to six on Wednesday afternoon and was dropped to four Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday afternoon the district announced that there are now five schools and 22 individual classrooms on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the five schools, two are on outbreak status for respiratory and gastrointestinal illness, one for gastrointestinal only, and two are for respiratory only. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEBRUARY 27, 6:25 A.M. UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northern Nevada Public Health is speaking out on the recent outbreaks in multiple Washoe County schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been trying to get answers and learned the number of schools impacted increased on Wednesday afternoon before the Washoe County School District reported a slight decrease on Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 6:42 p.m. on Wednesday four Washoe County schools are on outbreak status, down from six reported Wednesday afternoon and five reported on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two are dealing with respiratory illness outbreaks, one with gastrointestinal, and one is dealing with both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional 20 classrooms are now in outbreak status. 15 of them for respiratory and five for gastrointestinal illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've been pressing the school district all day, but they tell us they will not release the names of the schools affected at this time. Northern Nevada Public Health tells us that's due to HIPAA policies. However, they say the families of the schools impacted have been notified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liliana Wilbert, an epidemiologist for NNPH, says, "In order to protect the confidentiality of the schools and the families that are impacted we do not share that type of information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some of those affiliated with affected schools have reached out to 2 News Nevada to share that schools attended by their children have been affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An email obtained by 2 News Nevada that was sent to parents at Van Gorder Elementary School said that the school has seen an increase in the number of students and staff members who have been absent or sent home due to diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, muscle aches, and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another email obtained by 2 News Nevada confirms that a STEM Night planned for Van Gorder Elementary on Tuesday was canceled and will be rescheduled due to the school being placed on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents at Rollan Melton Elementary reached out to 2 News Nevada about multiple instances of children suffering gastrointestinal issues, with more than a dozen said to have been sent home. While parents have reported illness at Rollan Melton, we have not been able to obtain any notice from the district formally naming it as a school on outbreak status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washoe County School District wants to make it clear that if families have not heard from them about their schools, then that means those schools are not impacted by an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilbert says right now the respiratory illnesses they are seeing are RSV, influenza, and general influenza-like illnesses that are more commonly reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northern Nevada Public Health is practicing its clean-up procedures for these illnesses. That includes removing all nearby individuals, cleaning and sanitizing contaminated areas, and keeping sick students and staff away from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilbert says if your child is starting to show any symptoms of illnesses they should stay at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, region-wide and not limited to schools, NNPH is reporting there are 187 RSV cases reported, 36 hospitalizations due to flu, and 19 deaths due to flu, two of those deaths being under the age of 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEBRUARY 26, 3:15 P.M.

But drugmakers can’t actually start making the doses until the FDA selects the strains.

This year’s FDA flu meeting was scheduled for March 13, with a final decision from the agency on the strain expected shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Tan said that depending on the vaccine technology used, manufacturers can wait until late March for input from the FDA on strain selection to produce enough doses for the fall — but no longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If the strain selection happens much later than now, it’s going to be really, really tight, but the manufacturers will scramble and can make it happen,” Tan said. “If the delay is any longer than late March, it’s going to put manufacturers into a huge bind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The cancelation of the meeting comes amid a particularly bad flu season this year, with as many as 910,000 hospitalizations so far, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

Typically, the agency must provide two weeks’ notice of a meeting to allow for a public comment period, meaning any advisory committee meeting likely wouldn’t happen until mid-March at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, a committee member and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said agency officials offered no explanation for the canceled meeting, nor did they indicate whether it would be rescheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“What worries me about this, I think it’s part of the bigger picture, which is this sort of dissolution of public health infrastructure, that we don’t need experts anymore,” said Offit, who helped develop a vaccine for rotavirus that was later sold to drugmaker Merck. “We don’t need experts advising us at the CDC, we don’t need experts advising us from the FDA. We’ll just figure it out ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Earlier this month, federal health officials &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-vaccine-committee-meeting-kennedy-postponed-hhs-rcna191659" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:also abruptly postponed a CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;also abruptly postponed a CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Asked whether he’s concerned about next season’s flu shot supply, Offit said, “I think we’ll have a flu vaccine this year, although I guess I shouldn’t say anything because everything seems unimaginable, and yet it still happens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone over 6 months old. Data so far show that this year’s flu vaccine is 63% to 78% effective for preventing hospitalization in children and teens, and 41% to 55% effective for adults, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm?s_cid=mm7406a2_w" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC reported Thursday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC reported Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If drugmakers don’t have enough time to produce the vaccines because of the canceled meeting, “many lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost,” said Dr. Tin Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This decision — and other federal efforts to undermine well-established science about vaccine safety — puts everyone at risk, especially when we are currently experiencing the worst U.S. flu season in more than a decade,” Tin Tan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Flu vaccine manufacturers are still preparing for next year’s flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a statement, a spokesperson for Sanofi said it has “already begun production for the 2025-2026 flu season in the Northern Hemisphere and will be ready to support final strain selections in time for the season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A spokesperson for GSK, another flu vaccine manufacturer, said it’s aware of the canceled meeting and is continuing to work with the FDA on its flu strain recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-shot-supply-fall-short-year-fdas-canceled-meeting-sparks-worries-rcna194031" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NBCNews.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;NBCNews.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 23:01:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE0xSG0zbTVtS0FZdC00Q3R6ZDgxMUE3LURIUUFvTWxiaWR4dmE4OHVudU1vLUUxVGFqckRvejJHSEpSUGFVOVh5aXg1RXU1OXNEN2N3NWR3RUNTUVhvNF96S2I5d0t3VlFLVjNyUUFrM3NqeUk5YTlR</guid></item><item><title>Harsh flu season has health officials worried about brain complications in children - The Associated Press</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQcHQwU0ZwbkNPaFhHbFYxbFJ3VTVTaGNLM09IbURhb2hpUzlJWXIxMGo4R3RwY19KYnphLVNrOXlvUFlabnBDN0l1X2FRSW94STF6Y0tTaTlvU25lS25KU3NYMmRMX0NkVXAxZVBEV2NOaFFLa0JmYjFnTXZmWlJRNnF0YVBOWEpBbEpNZE1DNTBLMzlnVEJFUlEwekNYUGdlQWxN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Associated Press</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 22:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQcHQwU0ZwbkNPaFhHbFYxbFJ3VTVTaGNLM09IbURhb2hpUzlJWXIxMGo4R3RwY19KYnphLVNrOXlvUFlabnBDN0l1X2FRSW94STF6Y0tTaTlvU25lS25KU3NYMmRMX0NkVXAxZVBEV2NOaFFLa0JmYjFnTXZmWlJRNnF0YVBOWEpBbEpNZE1DNTBLMzlnVEJFUlEwekNYUGdlQWxN</guid></item><item><title>Brain Map Reveals Early Signs of MS Before Symptoms Appear - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXEFVX3lxTE9MNkhSMUFYU24yLXRlYXNQN0x0aGNRdHFpcG5LSm1GMVA3eS1ZWkhjTG5Mc0JUa0tUcG82NHZoemc1SlZRbW9RMnN4ZHBUOG1GSEhMOE5tMWJ0UV9q?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have created a four-dimensional brain map that reveals how MS-like lesions form, providing new insights into the earliest stages of the disease. Using a marmoset model instead of mice, they tracked lesion development in real time with MRI imaging, identifying vulnerable brain regions weeks before visible damage occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key finding was the role of a specific type of astrocyte expressing the gene &lt;em&gt;SERPINE1&lt;/em&gt;, which clustered near brain borders and influenced immune responses and myelin repair. These discoveries could help detect MS earlier and guide future treatments to slow or stop disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early MS Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; A new MRI signature reveals brain regions at risk for MS damage before lesions form.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astrocyte Role:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;SERPINE1&lt;/em&gt;-expressing astrocytes may contribute to both brain repair and disease progression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Research Model:&lt;/strong&gt; A marmoset model better mimics human MS, offering real-time tracking of lesion formation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NIH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have created a four-dimensional brain map that reveals how lesions similar to those seen in human MS form. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, provide a window into the early disease state and could help identify potential targets for MS treatments and brain tissue repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-107981"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ms-brain-map-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ms-brain-map-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ms-brain-map-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ms-brain-map-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ms-brain-map-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ms-brain-map-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ms-brain-map-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ms-brain-map-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ms-brain-map-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ms-brain-map-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ms-brain-map-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ms-brain-map-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ms-brain-map-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ms-brain-map-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/ms-brain-map-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The scientific teams are building a new model of a different autoimmune condition affecting brain borders. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by postdoctoral fellow Jing-Ping Lin, Ph.D., and senior investigator Daniel S. Reich, M.D., Ph.D., both at NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), combined repeated MRI imaging with brain-tissue analysis, including gene expression, to track the onset and development of MS-like lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They uncovered a new MRI signature that can help detect brain regions at risk for damage weeks before any visible lesions occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also identified “microenvironments” within affected brain tissue based on observed patterns of neural function, inflammation, immune and support cell responses, gene expression, and levels of damage and repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying the early events that occur after inflammation and teasing apart which are reparative versus which are damaging, can potentially help us identify MS disease activity sooner and develop treatments to slow or stop its progression,” said Dr. Reich.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS is caused by the body’s immune system attacking the protective covering of nerve fibers, called myelin. This leads to inflammation, loss of myelin, and formation of “lesions” or “plaques” within the brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of what is known about MS progression has come from analysis of postmortem human brain tissue, usually obtained decades after the initial onset of disease. This means missing early changes that occurred prior to the onset of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To mimic the conditions of the human brain, the researchers opted not to use a mouse model for MS, instead advancing a model that uses the marmoset, a nonhuman primate. Compared to mouse brains, marmoset and human brains have a higher ratio of white matter (the “wires” of the brain) to gray matter (neuronal cell bodies).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The marmoset model creates multiple lesions that closely resemble those seen in human MS and that can be tracked in real time using MRI imaging. Because these lesions can be induced experimentally, the model offers a look at the earliest stages of inflammation and immune responses that lead to MS-like demyelination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key player identified was a specific type of astrocyte, one of the support cell types in the brain, that turns on a gene called &lt;em&gt;SERPINE1&lt;/em&gt; or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (&lt;em&gt;PAI1&lt;/em&gt;). They found SERPINE1-expressing astrocytes in vulnerable brain borders before visible damage occurs, clustering near blood vessels and the fluid-filled ventricles of the brain and signaling future areas of lesion development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These astrocytes also appeared to influence the behavior of other cells near the lesion area, including the ability of immune cells to enter the brain and contribute to inflammation, as well as the precursor cells involved in myelin repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that SERPINE1-expressing astrocytes accumulated at the edges of growing lesions, where damage happens but healing also begins, their potential dual role in coordinating signals that could lead to either tissue repair or further damage was an unexpected wrinkle that will require further study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that the earliest responses could be a part of a protective mechanism that becomes overwhelmed as the injury progresses. It’s also possible that the same mechanism could itself become disease-causing.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If one imagines a fort under siege, initially the walls might hold off the attack,” said Dr. Reich. “But if those walls are breached, all the defenses inside can be turned against the fort itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings may also have implications for brain injuries beyond what is seen in MS. While there are different types of focal brain injuries, including traumatic brain injury, stroke, inflammation, and infection, there is a finite number of ways the tissue can react to injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, many of the reactions seen here to inflammation, stress, and tissue damage are likely to be common across injury types, and the brain map created in this study can act as a resource to allow comparisons to be made in a more human-like context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific teams are building a new model of a different autoimmune condition affecting brain borders. They are also looking to expand their data set to include aged animals, which could help improve our understanding of progressive MS, a disease state with a significant and unmet therapeutic need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was supported in part by the Intramural Research Program at the NIH with additional support from the Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

The precise cause of MS remains unclear, but the disease involves an inappropriate immune response and subsequent failure to repair myelin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although MS therapies have been effective in controlling peripheral inflammation, understanding the cellular dynamics of lesion progression during early phases is crucial for developing treatments that promote timely remyelination and repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RATIONALE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current understanding of MS pathology is largely derived from postmortem human tissue studies or rare brain biopsies, which capture disease at a single, often late, time point. To address this limitation, we used a clinically relevant model, the common marmoset (&lt;em&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/em&gt;) with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), to study MS-like lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model closely mimics MS lesion development and evolution, offering insights that are transferable to the clinical setting. Although structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is noninvasive and effective for monitoring lesion changes, it lacks the specificity required to reveal the cellular and molecular diversity within lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we integrated longitudinal MRI, histopathology, spatial transcriptomics, and single-nucleus RNA profiling to examine the signaling profiles involved in lesion development and resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified five microenvironment (ME) groups—related to neural function, immune and glial responses, tissue destruction and repair, and regulatory networks at brain borders—that emerged during lesion evolution. Before visible demyelination, astrocytic and ependymal secretory signals marked perivascular and periventricular regions, which later became demyelination hotspots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified an MRI biomarker, the ratio of proton density–weighted signal to &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; relaxation time, which was sensitive to the hypercellularity phase preceding myelin destruction. At lesion onset, we observed a global shift in cellular connectivity, particularly in extracellular matrix–mediated signaling. Early responses involved the proliferation and diversification of microglia and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As lesions developed, EAE-associated glia were replaced by monocyte derivatives at the lesion center, with persistent lymphocytes seen in aged lesions. Concurrently with demyelination, reparative signaling modules appeared at the lesion edge as early as 10 days after lesion establishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also noted an overrepresentation of genes involved in the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) at the brain borders and the formation of concentric glial barriers at the lesion edge, prompting perturbation analysis to contextualize EAE-associated changes and identify potential therapeutics to protect tissue and enhance repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified a SERPINE1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; astrocytic subtype, acting as a secretory hub at the perivascular and periventricular zones, which underlies the onset of lesions in both marmoset EAE and MS. Our work offers a spatiotemporally resolved molecular map as a resource to benefit MS research and to guide identification of candidates for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 22:21:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTE9MNkhSMUFYU24yLXRlYXNQN0x0aGNRdHFpcG5LSm1GMVA3eS1ZWkhjTG5Mc0JUa0tUcG82NHZoemc1SlZRbW9RMnN4ZHBUOG1GSEhMOE5tMWJ0UV9q</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Say Eating This Nut At Breakfast Could Boost Your Brain Power All Day - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOTWxwVzBiNkFCekRQOWo1N3l6RXF2Q2VXaFpKQUI1MFZDQmxGZ3VTQWpOQXJHNVZiMlFMbUc0LWk0eUhYcjA4M1p4MDhUblhOQjAzQ3ZueFpnNDd3MWZCMmdHenJwbFR6aVZ1MUdGb0M4UnlkSXpvSk1aUTFzSGpMMWcyVjFPTGpUaXdlSC1CUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-j4k1z9 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a29329090/0122-0131-brain-power-state-of-the-brain-union-turn-on-autopilot-qa-is-brain-candy-legit-cycle-pit-stop-when-youre-in-overdrive-november-2019/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a29329090/0122-0131-brain-power-state-of-the-brain-union-turn-on-autopilot-qa-is-brain-candy-legit-cycle-pit-stop-when-youre-in-overdrive-november-2019/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="brain" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; may feel naturally fired up in the morning, making you feel ready to tackle the day, it’s easy to hit a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g19957045/afternoon-slump-fixes/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g19957045/afternoon-slump-fixes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="mental slump by the afternoon" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;mental slump by the afternoon&lt;/a&gt;.

But Whyte says more research is needed to figure out the right amount. “There has been no ‘dose response’ investigation to date,” he says. “This makes it difficult to give any clear guidance on how much to consume.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In the meantime, there’s no harm in adding walnuts to your breakfast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Mostly, it’s important to eat a healthy overall diet to support brain health, Dr. Sachdev says. “A healthy and balanced diet is important for all elements of body function, including good brain function,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If your diet isn't the best, Segil says adding a multivitamin to your routine can support good brain health too.

        &lt;p&gt;TORONTO — Ontario identified 78 new measles cases over the course of two weeks, public health officials said Thursday, calling it the largest outbreak the province has seen in almost 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new cases bring Ontario's total this year to just over 140, far surpassing the 101 total infections recorded in the province between 2013 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sarah Wilson, a public health physician with Public Health Ontario, said the last time there was a sizable outbreak in the province was 2008 when there was a total of 58 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the largest measles outbreak that we've experienced in the province of Ontario since measles was eliminated from Canada in 1998," Wilson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all of the new cases are connected to an interprovincial outbreak that began in October, which has sickened 177 people in Ontario and also saw the virus spread in New Brunswick and Manitoba. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The epicentre of Ontario's outbreak has been in neighbouring Southwestern and Grand Erie public health regions. Wilson said the concentration of cases in unvaccinated people could explain how quickly the outbreak spread over the last two weeks. Quebec has also reported an outbreak of 27 cases that began in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the outbreak, 18 kids have been hospitalized in Ontario, including one who required intensive care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly contagious — but preventable — airborne disease has primarily infected children and teenagers who are unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the cases reported Thursday was in an unvaccinated child who acquired measles outside of Canada and required hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the country, Public Health Agency of Canada is reporting 77 cases this year, but its latest data is outdated and only spans to Feb. 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is also seeing measles spreading, marking its first measles death in a decade Wednesday after an unvaccinated child died in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. Each patient with measles can transmit the virus to another 16 to 18 people, said Janna Shapiro, a post-doctoral fellow at the Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases affiliated with the University of Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason, it usually serves as a sign of what's to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Whenever vaccination rates start to go down, we get worried about measles because it's the first thing that's going to come back because it's so, so, so contagious. That is also what allows these outbreaks to grow faster than other types of outbreaks," Shapiro said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It usually begins with a fever, cough, runny nose and red watery eyes, followed by a red blotchy rash that starts on the face and spreads to the body and limbs. The virus can lead to pneumonia, inflammation of the brain and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada eliminated measles in 1998, which required a low level of transmission for at least a year and 90 to 95 per cent vaccination coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're now at risk of losing our elimination status in Canada if these outbreaks continue," Shapiro said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With March Break around the corner, she said airports and planes are opportune places for the virus to spread, and vaccination is the best path of protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's a misconception for some people that measles is not a serious disease. And measles very much is a serious disease," Shapiro said.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Drugs can't stop Alzheimer's disease yet. But sometimes, they can slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Things have just plateaued," says Myra Solano Garcia, 66, who developed memory problems in her 50s, and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I can drive. I can take care of the house, I can cook," she says, "all of that normal stuff that people do."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia credits the drug &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/10/g-s1-3818/fda-advisors-back-alzheimer-drug-donanemab-despite-risks" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;donanemab&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which she began taking as part of a clinical trial at the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, now marketed as Kisunla, in July of 2024. It's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5300930/did-an-alzheimers-drug-give-sue-and-ken-bell-more-time-maybe" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one of two drugs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; approved since 2023 that can clear the brain of sticky amyloid plaques, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But there is no way to know whether Kisunla is the reason Solano Garcia can still do so much.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We don't have the ability to say because you've taken the medication, you haven't declined," says &lt;a href="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/lon-schneider/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Lon Schneider&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at USC's Keck School of Medicine who oversaw the donanemab trial there.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both Kisunla and the other approved drug, Leqembi, have been shown to slow down the mental decline of Alzheimer's by more than 25%. But that's in a group of patients—an individual may do much better, or not be helped at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A life, interrupted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia grew up in New Jersey as part of a Cuban-American family with lots of singers. She studied piano and voice in college. As a young adult, she made singing her career.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I played Maria in West Side Story in summer stock," she says. "I performed at Carnegie Hall and Fisher Hall."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Later, she moved to California and ran fundraising campaigns for colleges and universities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was in her early 50s that Solano Garcia began noticing problems with her memory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A doctor told her she had attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and for years she mistakenly thought that was the problem. But her memory kept getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The turning point came during COVID, when she started a new job.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Three months in, I realized I couldn't do the work," she says. "I couldn't remember the people's names. I couldn't do the technology."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So Solano Garcia went to a neuropsychiatrist, who diagnosed her with Alzheimer's disease and referred her to doctors at USC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They asked, 'Would you like to be part of the [donanemab] trial?' and I said, you bet I would," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A brain cleared of plaques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia began going in for monthly infusions, which she didn't mind, and mental tests, which she found frustrating. When the trial ended, she opted to continue taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It hasn't restored her memory or thinking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Solano Garcia says she isn't getting worse, at least not very quickly. Also, scans show that the beta-amyloid plaques that had built up in her brain are mostly gone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That means she may be able to stop getting infusions of Kisunla.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studies showed that it's safe for doctors to "treat until plaques are down to normal and then stop, and perhaps re-treat if plaques begin to grow back," USC's Schneider says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This option is one of the key differences between Kisunla and Leqembi, which was administered throughout its clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So at USC, doctors have a weekly meeting to discuss how patients are doing on Kisunla, and whether they might be candidates to stop taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia says doctors told her she's one of those patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm almost done with the infusions, so it's really exciting," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Still no cure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia knows her brain is not what it once was.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I don't do well with numbers," she says. "I have difficulty remembering names. My poor husband, I forget what he tells me."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She's not able to return to her fundraising career. And she has lost much of her command of the piano.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So Solano Garcia maintains her household, runs errands, and volunteers with the Alzheimer's Association.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She also makes a weekly visit to a local memory care, where she sings for, and with, the residents.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We start out with the Star Spangled Banner, and we do some movie songs," she says, and "Coming 'Round the Mountain."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia says she's learned a lot from people in the unit, most of whom have advanced Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's humbling because they used to know all of this music," she says. "And I know that as time goes, I'll be just like them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But she's hoping that Kisunla will postpone that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The strangely adorable and resilient tardigrade, or water bear, just might hold the key to making cancer treatment a lot more (water-) bearable. That’s because a team of researchers just found evidence that a protein produced by these microscopic creatures could protect our healthy cells from the ravages of radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at MIT, the University of Iowa, and elsewhere conducted the new study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01360-5"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this Wednesday in &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;. In experiments with mice, the research team observed that the protein reduced radiation damage in normal cells, while still allowing the radiation therapy to target cancerous cells. The findings could someday lead to an invaluable add-on treatment for many cancer patients, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tardigrades are extremophiles, notorious for their remarkable ability to survive some of the most inhospitable conditions on Earth (and space). One of the conditions the hardy critters evolved to withstand is extreme doses of radiation—thousands of times more than a human can handle—and one of the tricks they use to resist that radiation is the production of something called the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6773438/"&gt;damage suppressor protein&lt;/a&gt;, or Dsup. This protein, as the name implies, is thought to suppress radiation-induced DNA damage by binding to DNA strands and preventing them from breaking apart as usual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research team decided to test whether it was possible to safely transfer the tardigrade’s body armor against radiation to other animals, starting with mice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using mRNA technology, the team made it possible for certain cells in its mice to temporarily produce Dsup (only a few hours), then they exposed the cells to radiation. The researchers specifically chose cells lining the mouth and rectum, since radiation is commonly used to treat cancers in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Just as with tardigrades, the team’s mice appeared to have added protection against radiation damage, the researchers found. In experiments with mice that had oral cancer, they also demonstrated that the mRNA therapy didn’t impair radiation’s ability to kill off nearby tumor cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The strategy may be broadly applicable to the protection of healthy tissue from DNA-damaging agents,” the researchers wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Of course, this research still is a long way from being applicable to human cancer patients, and it will take more study and tweaking to make this technology safe and practical for medical use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scientists plan to create an upgraded version of the protein that’s less likely to provoke an unwanted response from our immune system, for instance. Researchers elsewhere have also &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/new-species-of-tardigrade-displays-superhero-like-healing-ability-2000516253"&gt;recently discovered &lt;/a&gt;tardigrades that are even more resistant to radiation, suggesting that Dsup isn’t the only radiation-proofing tool we can borrow from them. But if the team’s work does continue to progress, it could eventually provide widespread benefits to the roughly &lt;a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/01/17/radiation-therapy-for-cancer-pain-relief/#:~:text=%22Radiation%20therapy%20is%20typically%20used,helping%20to%20ease%20agonizing%20aches."&gt;50 to 60% of cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; who undergo radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The protein could even possibly be used to protect astronauts from space-related radiation or to protect cancer patients from other sources of treatment-induced DNA damage, such as chemotherapy drugs, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Radiation can be very helpful for many tumors, but we also recognize that the side effects can be limiting,” study co-author Giovanni Traverso, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT and a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, told &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/tiny-tardigrades-protein-may-help-cancer-patients-tolerate-radiation-therapy-0226"&gt;MIT News&lt;/a&gt;. “There’s an unmet need with respect to helping patients mitigate the risk of damaging adjacent tissue.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tardigrades have long been one of the most fascinating animals around because of their manifold invulnerabilities. If we’re lucky, we might one day harness a bit of that superpower for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers analyzed data from over 73,000 individuals using wearable devices to track their activity levels, providing objective measurements of movement and sedentary behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with higher energy expenditure were 14% to 40% less likely to develop these conditions, while more time spent sitting increased disease risk by up to 54%. These findings suggest that promoting physical activity could be a key strategy in reducing the burden of neurological and mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower Disease Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; People with higher physical activity levels were 14% to 40% less likely to develop dementia, stroke, anxiety, depression, or sleep disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sedentary Behavior Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; More time spent sitting increased disease risk by 5% to 54%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective Tracking:&lt;/strong&gt; The study used wearable devices for accurate measurements, reducing reliance on self-reported activity data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who get moderate to vigorous physical activity may be less likely to develop dementia, stroke, anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders, according to a preliminary study released today, February 27, 2025, that will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s 77th Annual Meeting taking place April 5–9, 2025, in San Diego and online.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the more time people spent sitting, the more likely they were to develop one of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research highlights the role of physical activity and sedentary behavior as modifiable factors that may enhance brain health and reduce the incidence of these diseases,” said study author Jia-Yi Wu, MD, of Fudan University in Shanghai, China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is promising to think that encouraging people to make these lifestyle changes could potentially lessen the burden of these diseases in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt; &lt;iframe title="How Exercise Protects Your Brain from Aging and Disease" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/01Yh8fPpUDw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video Credit: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a large United Kingdom database, researchers looked at data from 73,411 people with an average age of 56 who wore accelerometer devices continuously for seven days to measure their physical activity, how much energy they used on their activities and how much time they spent sitting each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic equivalents (METs) were used to quantify energy expenditure. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was defined as activities with an energy expenditure of at least three METs, where walking or cleaning was three METs and more intense exercise like cycling could be around six METs, depending on speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who had moderate to vigorous physical activity energy expenditure were 14% to 40% less likely to develop the five diseases than those who had lower energy expenditure, depending on how active they were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people who did not develop any of the diseases had an average daily moderate to vigorous physical activity energy expenditure of 1.22 kilojoules per kilogram, compared to 0.85 for the people who developed dementia, 0.95 for those who developed sleep disorders, 1.02 for stroke, 1.08 for depression and 1.10 for anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more time people spent sitting, the higher their risk of developing one of the diseases, with the increase ranging from 5% to 54% higher than those who spent the least amount of time sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some previous studies have relied on people reporting on their own levels of activity,” Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With our large number of participants and the use of devices that provide objective measurements of activity levels, these results will have implications for assessing risk factors and developing interventions to prevent the development of these diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that 96% of the participants were white people, so the results may not apply to other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was supported by grants from the Scientific and Technological Innovation 2030 – “Brain Science and Brain-inspired Artificial Intelligence” Major Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this exercise and brain health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f381879680809e929db392929ddd909c9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Renee Tessman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Renee Tessman – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s 77th Annual Meeting&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 21:39:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE0wSDBWam5ULUVZOGVhQ3oxeDk3Wnd3Y25UTllzMUptcGZaMWFoNWNTV0E0WFVweEZUdjVIU1Ztb3pUWDg2cTBzWTB2RFo2OTRZSnlnSWlYNXMwbTJaeVNveEtwUmNsaFFiMFBHVWdUWFROQ05MUFBF</guid></item><item><title>Early mRNA vaccine trial results show potential breakthrough in fighting one of the deadliest cancers - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxNdnFKQnRMQVpyZU9FcDlnRk1LNVlabnVWSjgyZnRLWW84ZW1scjZuREx3UTREZmhnRVN5ck05Zk1iMUIxR2d0WWw3WE9mdGxORUIyRlIzOXVEQzVxa1EyUFFzaHZ0SjZRekFyNF8tNnVUYnRUaWRmQ1R2cDIzX3ZUZ3VIWG9ldUVjNEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-cy="article-image" class="sc-1b197338-7 iqAtsy"&gt;&lt;img alt="A woman wearing a head wrap gets a vaccine from a masked doctor" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=320&amp;amp;q=75 320w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=384&amp;amp;q=75 384w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=480&amp;amp;q=75 480w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=576&amp;amp;q=75 576w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=768&amp;amp;q=75 768w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;q=75 1024w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=1280&amp;amp;q=75 1280w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=1440&amp;amp;q=75 1440w" src="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=1440&amp;amp;q=75"&gt;&lt;p data-cy="caption" class="sc-13b6974d-9 dKtuAn"&gt;Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers.
