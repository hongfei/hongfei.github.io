Most of them were unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e16186" class="body-graf"&gt;That's why some doctors are hoping that the first nasal flu vaccine available for use at home can improve vaccination rates among people, especially children, who are afraid of needles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2af093" class="body-graf"&gt;AstraZeneca's FluMist Home, which was approved last fall, is now available with a prescription for children ages 2 and over, and adults up to age 49.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-32cf81" class="body-graf"&gt;A 2019 review from researchers at the University of Michigan found the majority of children and up to 30% of young adults are &lt;a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/147205/jan13818.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;afraid of needles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e6326" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Zachary Hoy, board-certified pediatric infectious disease specialist at Pediatrix Medical Group in Nashville, Tennessee, said many children are scared because they aren't old enough to understand what vaccines are and why they are important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8da693" class="body-graf"&gt;“Most of the time, the anxiety and worry before the shot is scarier than the actual shot,” Hoy said.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-df85f1"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1667" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/250814-flumist-syringe-se-353p-01c9cf.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250814-flumist-syringe-se-353p-01c9cf.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/250814-flumist-syringe-se-353p-01c9cf.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250814-flumist-syringe-se-353p-01c9cf.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250814-flumist-syringe-se-353p-01c9cf.jpg" alt="FluMist Home is only available online.

However, after the &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html" target="_blank"&gt;2009 swine flu pandemic&lt;/a&gt; introduced the new H1N1 strain, several studies found the nasal spray was less effective than other flu vaccines. This prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flumist-nose-spray-vaccine-doesn-t-work-experts-say-n597411" target="_blank"&gt;recommend against using the nasal spray in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, the CDC said the nasal spray accounted for &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/media/releases/2016/s0622-laiv-flu.html" target="_blank"&gt;one-third of all flu vaccines &lt;/a&gt;given to children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f075ed" class="body-graf"&gt;In response, FluMist’s manufacturers reformulated it to more closely match circulating strains, including H1N1, and the nasal spray returned in 2018. Like injectable flu vaccines, FluMist is updated each season based on recommendations from global health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-41bf7f" class="body-graf"&gt;“FluMist’s efficacy is comparable to injectable flu vaccines and is a safe and effective needle-free option for flu protection,” AstraZeneca spokesperson Andrew Leone said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e7bcca" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts say it’s too early to tell how bad the upcoming flu season will be.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59fbe1" class="body-graf"&gt;Typically, flu vaccines are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-vaccines-work/php/effectiveness-studies/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;40% and 60% effective&lt;/a&gt; in preventing severe illness, and FluMist Home should be equally protective. The doses for the 2026-2027 season contain three virus strains: an A/H1N1 strain, an A/H3N2 strain and a B strain from the B/Victoria lineage, according to the drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-452946" class="body-graf"&gt;The FluMist Home vaccine contains a weakened form of a live virus to stimulate the immune system. Pregnant women or people with compromised immune systems are advised to talk with their doctor before using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-9064fb" class="body-heading"&gt;Does insurance cover it? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59db30" class="body-graf"&gt;FluMist Home is available only online. People ordering the nasal spray will need to complete a medical screening questionnaire at &lt;a href="https://www.flumist.com/" target="_blank"&gt;FluMist.com&lt;/a&gt; that is reviewed by a health care professional, according to the drugmaker. FluMist Home’s online pharmacy will then collect the insurance information and bill the health plan directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2b34b7" class="body-graf"&gt;A temperature monitor on the packaging will verify that the vaccine has been maintained at the appropriate temperature during shipping and delivery. Green means it's safe to use. Red means it's not.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-283a97" class="body-graf"&gt;Christina Aungst, senior pharmacy editor at GoodRx, estimates people with insurance will likely only have to pay an $8.99 shipping fee for the nasal spray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-40d601" class="body-graf"&gt;“Currently, if you don’t have insurance, FluMist is only available in a health care setting,” AstraZeneca's Leone said. “We hope to provide a cash pay option for FluMist Home in future seasons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-be6052" class="body-graf"&gt;When FluMist is given in a health care office or clinic, most insurance plans — including &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/insurance/medicare/does-medicare-cover-flu-shots" target="_blank"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/health-topic/vaccines/medicaid-vaccine-coverage" target="_blank"&gt;Medicaid&lt;/a&gt; — will cover it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3496b8" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director of infection prevention at Yale School of Medicine, worries people may not administer the nasal spray vaccine properly without a doctor's supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c35fb" class="body-graf"&gt;“What if they have a runny nose? How far back do they need to spray in the nose? What if they store it incorrectly in their house?” Roberts asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-adf462" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Kristina Bryant, pediatric infectious diseases physician at Norton Children’s in Louisville, Kentucky, and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, said the bottom line is that all the available flu vaccines offer comparable protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-237101" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“The most important thing to know is that vaccines only work if they are actually administered,” Bryant said. “Hopefully, the availability of a vaccine that can be administered in the home will make it easier for some people to be protected against flu.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 20:00:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQVlNtNXA3UE5jNEhsNXZ6aWZjZVBqT1IyY1FRTnk5enB2NlQ1T0o2LXJQUXd4TXVMN21pVjIyZTZjeWotcFIzMlRFdHJqVUNNTEpYd0h3dHhuUGVlRmpxY2lCTlNCdjFGeU5vaDc1TjhuT2t3enZFbWYzUVNvdGFvRkozcnBOYzVIekV3ZXg4RWNGYWItVmVvd250c01oSzNJWFc2Q0pNRHJQZ9IBVkFVX3lxTFBNTFZNSzlpaHdNLTRNU04xM0lmbWFIeF9fQm9FUEllYVZWZGV1SDlXOEFGNWhvTGRKQWZNdjF0N2FKOEJHX0NWODVQNFhSVkNTMDVIaml3</guid></item><item><title>纽约军团病集群增至99例， 4人死亡- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNbHpPRzczQmFjdEgxVVFqU3VzN25IZng0bC12NGNsSnZyRlhHYmxFTEoyZGR0ZTA4MGxiSl9rTmptZjVpU1VNWHZjQXpyY01HR1VWS19Ha0xYaTZWVk5wLXl5YmZsTG4talVJUk9ZWDdXbUVqeExWS2JkM2tTZFBSNzlmV0vSAYoBQVVfeXFMTVJpd0ZRLXA0OGQ2YzNtTTBoMDlLLUxyRjdxRWstWjBocjQySnFIbks0TmtVcHc2VVNNVWU3NHFCUHdSVFYtRkV0S3U0NUVYNy0yTEtPeXFmM0t3TVp0VGw5R25aVVFIc1kzeWprSnpBRDhreHNwb3pmQjUxRnRYZmdqREtuRmJ2U1pB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Health officials in New York City say a cluster of Legionnaires’ disease in Central Harlem has grown to &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fsite%2Fdoh%2Fhealth%2Fhealth-topics%2Flegionnaires-disease.page&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CAmanda.Sealy%40cnn.com%7C8ee77209fc3646fca65708dddbff5e5a%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638908612143625370%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=BFfVpeWuCjffe2%2B5W%2B%2F%2F0OZDo86Iq8C35QLlPbHeaLE%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;99 cases, including four deaths&lt;/a&gt;.

            Health officials suspect the bacteria that causes the disease, Legionella, originated cooling towers — devices that uses water to cool large buildings and then disperse mist into the air. If the water inside becomes too warm, stagnant, or isn’t properly disinfected, Legionella can grow and sicken people who inhale the mist.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The Department of Health says 11 of the 12 cooling towers have already been repaired and the final tower should be remediated by Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed0unzu00073b6oh1h9ib2b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health officials emphasized that plumbing systems are separate from cooling tower systems in affected buildings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed0unzu00083b6o11jftlw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This community outbreak is not related to a building’s hot or cold water supply. Residents in these ZIP codes can continue to drink water, bathe, shower, cook, and use their air conditioner,” it said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed769e500003b6qc3mzqvdt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The current Legionnaires’ cluster was first announced on July 25. Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said inspectors are working with building owners to ensure compliance with testing and remediation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmed7gqm500043b6qqrcamh34@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The good news is that new cases have begun to decline, which indicates that the sources of the bacteria have been contained,” Morse said. “New Yorkers who live or work in the identified ZIP codes and have flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible for timely diagnosis and treatment for the best chance at a good outcome.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Legionnaires’ disease causes flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, muscle aches, and shortness of breath. It is treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can lead to shock and multi-organ failure, according to the World Health Organization. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 10% of people who contract the disease die from complications, with older adults and people with weakened immune systems at higher risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Some people do this quickly by starting with a "loading" phase of 20 grams per day for a week and then lowering to 5 grams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Loading isn't necessary though, Professor Cooke said, because you get the same results by starting at 5 grams per day, it will just take a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;For most people it will result in more power and strength for explosive bursts of exercise and it improves recovery after exercise-related muscle damage as well as sarcopenia (loss of muscle as we age) if taken in conjunction with resistance training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Recently, researchers started delving deeper into the potential benefits of creatine among women and

which may negatively impact creatine metabolism so supplementation could be beneficial at this time, Professor Cooke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Research has shown creatine supplementation can help post-menopausal women with physical function when combined with resistance training and now experts want to explore how it might support bone health during perimenopause when bone density starts to decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;It's early days but research is also suggesting supplementation may benefit pre-menopausal women during their menstrual cycles when there's varying levels of creatine metabolism and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph_paragraph__iYReA"&gt;Some brands are now shamelessly trying to

Pregnancy was easy for Stevee Fazenbaker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-291149" class="body-graf"&gt;“I felt good the whole time. I was considered low risk,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “My last scan was at 20 weeks and she was measuring perfectly and looked great.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3e0e24" class="body-graf"&gt;During her remaining prenatal appointments, everything seemed as if it was going well and “there were no red flags,” Stevee Fazenbaker recalls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6f4417" class="body-graf"&gt;When Stevee Fazenbaker’s water broke, she went to the hospital, but labor didn’t progress as it should have. Doctors recommended  she undergo a cesarean section to deliver the baby, and Stevee Fazenbaker agreed. When Fletcher was born, the Fazenbakers knew she looked different than other newborns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c88abc" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was a complete shock when she was born that anything was wrong,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “Our initial thought was, ‘OK, her head’s really big. Maybe it’s hydrocephalus.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-401731" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hydroassoc.org/hydrocephalus-in-infants-and-children/" target="_blank"&gt;Hydrocephalus&lt;/a&gt; occurs when cerebral spinal fluid builds up in the brain, according to the Hydrocephalus Association. That can enlarge the head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cc69d8" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors took Fletcher to the neonatal intensive care unit to stabilize her, and the next day, she underwent an MRI, which revealed she had a brain tumor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c743a1" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was an extremely heavy time,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-60cdd9" class="body-graf"&gt;After about a week, doctors said the family could take Fletcher home for hospice care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-547c36" class="body-graf"&gt;“They prepared us for a two-week life expectancy,” Billy Fazenbaker, 30, tells TODAY.com. “They told us initially she would decline immediately. The meds would go up and up, and up and she would pass in her sleep.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2aefe0" class="body-graf"&gt;The tumor rested near Fletcher’s brain stem, and doctors thought  the mass would encroach on it, which could eventually stop the infant’s breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3511f3" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was a miracle in itself that we made it home,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “We came home and tried to live life with her.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d0b32f" class="body-graf"&gt;The couple prioritized showing their daughter as much as possible in what they thought would be her short life. When it rained, they took Fletcher — hooked to oxygen and a feeding tube — outside so she could feel the rain. Even though doctors thought Fletcher would never be able to suck, her parents gave her a pacifier, which she sucked. So, they gave her a bottle, and she drank it. Fletcher did many things that doctors told the Fazenbakers she’d never do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-634830" class="body-graf"&gt;“(By the first week's) end, she’s already doing a couple (of) normal baby things, which was amazing,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-29cf51" class="body-graf"&gt;About a month passed, and then Fletcher and the family returned to the hospital to see if the baby could undergo another MRI or they could receive “some form of clarity that we were doing the right thing,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c76a95" class="body-graf"&gt;“They said, ‘Just soak up your time. Sometimes when they’re in a home environment, a loving environment, they can do well for a little bit a time. But there’s nothing we can do,’” Stevee Fazenbaker recalls. “They wouldn’t even place a shunt in her.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d34c73" class="body-graf"&gt;Her parents had hoped a shunt, a surgically implanted tube that helps to drain cerebrospinal fluid from the brain, could reduce some of the pressure in Fletcher’s brain. Doctors didn’t believe the infant could survive the surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c05c52" class="body-graf"&gt;“She was alive, and we were loving it,” Billy Fazenbaker says. “But (we were) almost grieving her while she was alive.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-08a962" class="body-graf"&gt;When Fletcher turned 2 months old, the Fazenbakers wanted a second opinion and contacted a “reputable” hospital for a consultation. They were devastated by that meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-474e84" class="body-graf"&gt;“The doctor was like, ‘Look, I don’t even think it’s worth you driving here after seeing her through Zoom. I agree with (the hospital) where you delivered opinion, and I think you should enjoy your time,’” Stevee Fazenbaker recalls. “His exact words were, ‘You wouldn’t be doing something for her. You would be doing something to her.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-7a6710"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1875"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-3-te-250815-703ad0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-3-te-250815-703ad0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-3-te-250815-703ad0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-3-te-250815-703ad0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-3-te-250815-703ad0.jpg" alt="Doctors said their newborn would die within weeks.

They were “literally begging God for a walk-on-water miracle.” Soon after Fletcher turned 3 months old, their hospice nurse mentioned St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and asked if the couple had reached out to them. Immediately, they filled out an application for a second opinion. Forty-eight hours later, they received a call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb195a" class="body-graf"&gt;“She’s like, ‘So I think we can help you.’ How soon can you get here,’” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “(It) was the most exciting thing ever.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-417f1a" class="body-graf"&gt;The couple drove to Memphis and was stunned by what Dr. Aditi Bagchi told them when they met in November 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52ef52" class="body-graf"&gt;“She was like, ‘This is going to be a really bumpy road, but I think we can cure her,’” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “We went from hearing, ‘Go home on hospice and enjoy your time’ to ‘I think I can save your baby.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57eb25" class="body-graf"&gt;Bagchi believed that Fletcher had an infant-type hemispheric glioma, a tumor that she could treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-2c4f0c" class="body-heading"&gt;Infant-Type Hemispheric Gliomas &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11316d" class="body-graf"&gt;Until recently, doctors would sometimes see newborns, like Fletcher, with high-grade gliomas. Doctors thought that these brain tumors were the same as the aggressive brain tumor known as &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/men-s-health/glioblastoma-symptoms-migraine-rcna218836" target="_blank"&gt;glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt; that occurs in older children and adults. But clinical observations and ongoing research indicated that these gliomas found in infants behave differently. In 2021, doctors named them infant-type hemispheric gliomas to differentiate them from glioblastomas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a24e01" class="body-graf"&gt;“Research over the last decade or so has slowly given us hints that these tumors, which these little babies are getting, are different from the glioma that we see in older individuals,” Bagchi, a neuro-oncologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, tells TODAY.com. “It’s a relatively new … reclassification.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-76132a"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1406"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-4-te-250815-ad980b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-4-te-250815-ad980b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-4-te-250815-ad980b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-4-te-250815-ad980b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-4-te-250815-ad980b.jpg" alt="Doctors said their newborn would die within weeks.

With new DNA and RNA sequencing methods, experts were able to confirm that the infant-grade hemispheric gliomas have “different genetic drivers” than glioblastomas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-81d135" class="body-graf"&gt;“Their genome looks very different from the high-grade gliomas diagnosed in older children,” Bagchi explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-512f77" class="body-graf"&gt;As they are rare and newly classified, there’s a lack of awareness about infant-type hemispheric gliomas among doctors which could lead to delayed diagnosis, as in Fletcher’s case. It’s not uncommon for parents to hear the same devastating news the Fazenbakers did — that there is nothing doctors can do to help their infant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-38fa6a" class="body-graf"&gt;“When you look at these babies and their MRIs, these tumors are huge and they are scary looking,” Bagchi says. “They are misdiagnosed a lot of times.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-591c9f" class="body-graf"&gt;Bagchi says it’s important to raise awareness of infant-type hemispheric gliomas so that doctors in community hospitals can direct these patients to children’s hospitals for treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-883aeb" class="body-graf"&gt;“You don’t have to know how to cure it,” she says. “You just have to reach out to us.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-80be59" class="body-graf"&gt;Signs of infant-type hemispheric gliomas often are not present until birth. Though prenatal scans can sometimes identify a blood clot in the brain or detect that the head is larger than usual. In some cases, babies are born with normal-sized heads, but they begin growing larger. In babies who are not diagnosed at birth, they can experience signs including: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-00305d" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weakness on one side of the body&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-3ebecc" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not being able to eat or drink &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-65eacd" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bulging soft spot on the head&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8c60b9" class="body-graf"&gt;Treatment depends on the “molecular characteristics” of the tumor found upon biopsy of the tumor. Some tumors have genetic markers that respond to targeted therapy, while chemotherapy treats tumors without those markers. When the tumor shrinks, doctors can remove the mass from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-37a4d0" class="body-graf"&gt;Delayed treatment can lead to developmental delays for many babies. But still, their tumors can be treated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d32f2" class="body-graf"&gt;“It is life-saving for them to appropriately diagnose them and treat them,” Bagchi says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eedcf6" class="body-graf"&gt;In early 2026, Bagchi is launching a clinical trial to develop a standardized treatment protocol for infant-type hemispheric glioma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-8ef846" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Just Incredible’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52c292" class="body-graf"&gt;When Fletcher met Bagchi, the infant’s head was the size of a 5-year-old’s. Immediately, doctors scheduled a surgery to place a shunt in Fletcher’s brain to drain some of the excess fluid and reduce some of the pressure. Since the skin on Fletcher’s skull was very thin from “her head expanding,” doctors worried about the shunt staying in place — yet it did. Recovering from surgery was still tough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7b605b" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was a really bumpy road after that,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “She had sodium issues and really was unstable because she was draining so much fluid. Her head was changing so much, and her body was trying to adjust.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-2603bd"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1875"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-5-te-250815-6ade52.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-5-te-250815-6ade52.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-5-te-250815-6ade52.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-5-te-250815-6ade52.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-5-te-250815-6ade52.jpg" alt="Doctors said their newborn would die within weeks.

The tumor’s size meant that Fletcher’s eyes angled downward so she couldn’t look at her parents. Almost immediately after the shunt was placed, she could see better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-319c1c" class="body-graf"&gt;“The day after she had the shunt (implanted) is one of our very favorite days,” Stevee Fazenbaker says while crying. “That was really the first time she ever looked at us.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-33faac" class="body-graf"&gt;By Christmas, Fletcher stabilized, and Bagchi performed a biopsy, which confirmed Fletcher had an infant-type hemispheric glioma. The tumor had the markers that made it responsive to targeted treatment, an oral medication her parents gave her through a small tube that extended from her nose to her esophagus. From January to March, she took the medication twice a day, and it “shrunk her tumor in half.” In March 2023, Fletcher underwent surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e98bb" class="body-graf"&gt;“They were able to completely remove her entire tumor, which was just incredible,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4b971d" class="body-graf"&gt;Fletcher continued taking the targeted medication for the next seven months. This upcoming October will mark two years since she finished treatment. Since then, Fletcher’s scans have been clear, and she’s been thriving. She does have some developmental delays and spends her days in various therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-93d25a" class="body-graf"&gt;“Finally, she has control, holding her head completely on her own,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “She’s sitting on her own with a little bit of support around her.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a6329a" class="body-graf"&gt;Fletcher is a “very sweet, very, very happy girl,” who is sometimes “spicy,” especially when she’s over participating in therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f8359" class="body-graf"&gt;“She loves listening to music and stories. She loves being on the go,” Stevee Fazenbaker says. “She loves being outside. She loves all weather. She loves it when it rains. She loves it when it’s windy. She loves when the sun’s on her face.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf1f83" class="body-graf"&gt;The family hopes Fletcher’s story encourages people to seek second opinions if their child is sick. They also want to raise awareness of infant-type hemispheric gliomas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-589cf1"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="2634"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-7-te-250815-cad1c0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-7-te-250815-cad1c0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-7-te-250815-cad1c0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-7-te-250815-cad1c0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/hemispheric-glioma-7-te-250815-cad1c0.jpg" alt="Doctors said their newborn would die within weeks.

&lt;p&gt;Is your wallet getting as thin as your hair thanks to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/13/lifestyle/from-rogaine-to-robots-trendiest-hacks-balding-men-using-to-get-their-hair-back/"&gt;pricey pills and potions&lt;/a&gt; promising to save your strands?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’re not alone. In the US, more than &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/most-men-experience-hair-loss-it-isnt-inevitable" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;80% of men and nearly half of women&lt;/a&gt; will face significant hair loss in their lifetime, fueling a multi-billion-dollar industry selling quick fixes that don’t always work. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But before you empty your pockets, know this: There are a few simple everyday steps that one trichologist says can help protect your hair and keep it it looking fuller.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hair loss can lead to decreased self-esteem, anxiety and even depression in some people.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Rido – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;William Gaunitz, a certified trichologist and founder of &lt;a href="https://www.advancedtrichology.com/pages/william-gaunitz-trichologist-hair-loss-expert" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Advanced Trichology&lt;/a&gt;, shared five easy, effective ways to support scalp health and fight hair loss from home.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also gave The Post a heads-up about three popular hair hacks that could actually wind up doing more harm than good. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#1. Soak up some sunlight&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Get out in the sun for 15 minutes with no sunscreen to get a balanced amount of vitamin D3,” Gaunitz advised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is essential for creating the cells that develop into hair follicles. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34553483/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; a deficiency may contribute to issues like excessive shedding and female pattern hair loss. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if you’re staying out longer than 15 minutes, don’t forget the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/09/health/what-to-know-about-picking-sunscreen-including-2-key-ingredients/"&gt;SPF&lt;/a&gt; — even a small amount of time under a strong UV index without protection can lead to a sunburn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Up to 40% of women will experience some degree of female pattern hair loss by age 50. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Nadya Kolobova – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#2. Eat a balanced diet&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This one thing is more important than anything else,” Gaunitz stressed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you don’t eat animal protein or follow another special diet, he warned there’s an “extremely high” chance you’ll drain your nutrient stores unless you carefully replace them with other sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Discover your blood type and eat accordingly,” Gaunitz recommended. “That is a great way to understand what your body needs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;William Gaunitz, a certified trichologist, has been working in the hair loss industry since 2002. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instagram/williamgaunitztrichologist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#3. Check your gut health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have any consistent problems, like constipation, diarrhea or acid reflux, it is possible that your nutrient supply absorption may have been compromised,” Gaunitz said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means your body might not be absorbing nutrients properly even if you’re eating right — and those nutrient issues can impact your whole body, including your hair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#4 Don’t skip shampoo days&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Wash your hair at a minimum of every 48 hours with a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/best-shampoos-for-every-hair-type-review/"&gt;healthy shampoo&lt;/a&gt; that has some type of antimicrobial oil in it, like grapefruit seed, rosemary, tea tree or thyme,” Gaunitz suggested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keeping microbial overload in check gently and consistently is key to managing your scalp’s delicate microbiome without damage, he explained. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Studies have shown that regular scalp massage can lead to reduced hair loss and increased hair thickness.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instagram/mimada.beauty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;#5 Massage your scalp daily&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before you hit the shower, try the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoG8iygEecc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;scalp-over-skull massage technique&lt;/a&gt;. It’s believed to boost blood flow to hair follicles, break up mild calcification under the scalp and help clear out excess sebum, an oily substance crucial for hair growth that can be harmful if it builds up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This can drastically improve scalp health,” Gaunitz said. “You can also use a gua sha tool and massage the scalp with the edge, which requires less effort but is still marginally effective.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What to ditch from your routine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some “hacks” are doing more harm than good. Gaunitz said to skip these three.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1. Dermarolling daily.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This handheld microneedling device may seem like a quick fix, but “dermarolling at home daily is a bad idea because it can create scarring and trauma on the scalp, little micro infections, and in many cases will actually make your scalp worse,” Gaunitz warned. “Like anything, it should be done properly by a professional.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;While it’s often used to stimulate growth, incorrect or excessive derma rolling can worsen hair loss. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Mishy Skincare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2. Skipping wash day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The number of times I’ve heard somebody say that they were told by their stylist that they saw online that you shouldn’t wash your hair, and that’s why your hair is falling out, is absurd,” Gaunitz said. “If your scalp is unhealthy, or you are shedding in any way, you need to be shampooing regularly,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sebum on your scalp harbors bacteria, fungi and other bodily excretions. Removing this buildup is crucial to preventing further inflammation, Gaunitz said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Wash your hair daily or at least every 48 hours by scrubbing the surface of your scalp,” he advised. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#3. Slathering garlic juice, onion juice or undiluted rosemary oil directly on your scalp.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Although there are benefits to each of these, applying them directly to the scalp alters the microbiome,” Gaunitz said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You should not use them on their own except with a purpose, and they should not be used undiluted.”&lt;/p&gt;

That individual was hospitalized with the condition earlier this month, the health department said, but is now recovering at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said this person was likely infected in the southern half of the county in July, near the Jordan River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus is spread to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes, and both health departments urged people to protect themselves from mosquito bites to prevent contracting the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Salt Lake County Health Department said Thursday that 108 mosquito samples have tested positive for West Nile virus this year across the state, and because mosquitoes can travel several miles, everyone near any of those areas should take precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week's report from the Utah Department of Health and Human Services said mosquitoes have been found with West Nile virus in the Bear River Health District, Davis County, Salt Lake County, TriCounty (Uintah, Dagget and Duchesne) and in Utah County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reported that the percentage of mosquito pools testing positive at this point in the year, 1.53%, is higher than the last two years — 1.41% in 2024 and 0.99% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the Utah health department reported 14 cases of West Nile virus, 12 of which were the neuroinvasive form. It reported one Utahn died from the disease in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of West Nile virus, which appear between two and 14 days after a bite, include fever, headache, rash, vomiting, body aches and diarrhea. More severe cases can lead to neurological problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Salt Lake County Health Department said many who become infected may not even know; between 20% and 30% of infected people will not have symptoms and others will have only minor symptoms. It is estimated that less than 1% of people with West Nile virus develop the neuroinvasive form, which can lead to debilitating complications or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, there are likely many more than three Utahns who have been infected this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bear River Health Department suggested protection through "the 5 Ds": Drain standing water, avoid outdoor activities at dawn and dusk, use bug spray with DEET, dress in loose, long clothing and ensure door and window screens are repaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

(That's US$2,600 and US$6,500, or £2,000 and £4,900.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Ozempic vulva' is the latest unsightly and uncomfortable side effect being reported by women taking GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro (stock image posed by model)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The term labia puffing is a marketing term, not a formal medical one,' explains Dr Justin Perron, a specialist plastic surgeon and board member of the Australasian Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The labia majora, like other fatty areas, can lose volume after substantial weight loss.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These changes are more pronounced with rapid weight loss and in women over 35, where natural collagen and elastin reserves are already reduced,' adds Dr Perron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Effects may include deflation (a wrinkled appearance) and diminished elasticity, resulting in sagging or folds that make activities such as cycling, running or sex less comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 79,000 Australians are estimated to be using Ozempic, the GLP-1 injectable drug used both to treat diabetes and weight loss. The average patient loses an estimated 10-15 per cent of their body weight on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these drugs have transformed many bodies, the toll of rapid weight loss shows up from head to toe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'GLP-1 receptor agonists (semaglutide, tirzepatide) and other effective weight-loss interventions have created a new subset of patients experiencing rapid, significant weight loss,' Dr Perron says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Loss of subcutaneous fat is global – including the mons pubis and labia majora – sometimes giving the area a deflated or "aged" look. This can be due to ptosis of soft tissue, or atrophy of the fat in this area.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds that while formal registry data is limited, some ASAPS members have reported a rise in requests for vulvo-vaginal aesthetic procedures, including labia majora augmentation, over the past five to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This parallels trends in America and Britain, where it's often bundled under "genital rejuvenation",' he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Requests for 'labia-puffing' treatments to restore volume are on the rise (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perron notes that, anecdotally, he has seen an increase in genital rejuvenation consultations as a direct result of post-weight loss changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I personally see these requests several times a week,' he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Non-surgical labia puffing requires little downtime - light activity can resume almost immediately, though sex and intense exercise are usually off-limits for up to a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Risks can include bruising, swelling, asymmetry, overcorrection, infection, filler migration and rare vascular compromise,' notes Dr Perron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgical options - such as fat grafting or dermal fat grafts, occasionally with skin removal - require significantly greater downtime, and include risks such as 'swelling, bruising, infection, seroma, fat necrosis, oil cysts, asymmetry or partial fat loss requiring revision.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-7ff086d0-798b-11f0-b25e-05c31ac3b316" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14998721/I-Ozempic-vulva-latest-bizarre-effect-miracle-jabs-no-one-talks-theres-one-treatment-fix-it.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;READ MORE FROM DAILYMAIL+ &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;EXCLUSIVE NEWS AND FEATURES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14778367/Zoran-Vidovic-Zagi-Kozarov-Bali-hotel-death-development.html"&gt;When Zoran plunged to his death at a Bali hotel, his heartbroken fiancée begged for answers.

West Nile virus is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year, West Nile virus activity in mosquitoes has been detected in seven southern Idaho counties and neighboring Malheur County, Oregon. Not all counties collect and test mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We strongly encourage Idahoans to fight the bite of mosquitoes to protect themselves and their families,” said Deputy State Epidemiologist Dr. Kathy Turner. “This tragic death from West Nile virus is a good reminder for all of us to take protective measures against mosquito bites. Wear long sleeves and pants outside and use insect repellent. Around your home and yard, reduce standing water where mosquitoes can lay their eggs.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most people who are infected with West Nile virus do not experience symptoms. About one in five people who are infected with West Nile virus experience fever and other symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, swollen lymph glands or a rash. About one in 150 people who are infected experience severe illness affecting the brain and spinal cord, leading to hospitalization; about one in 10 people with severe West Nile virus die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Older adults and people with certain medical conditions are at greater risk of severe illness. Recovery from severe illness might take several weeks or months. Some effects might be permanent. Talk to your healthcare provider if you think you might be sick from West Nile virus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To protect against West Nile virus infection, avoid mosquitoes, particularly between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active. In addition, everyone should:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Wear loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and pants when outdoors.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Apply EPA-registered insect repellents to exposed skin. Carefully follow instructions on the product label, especially for children.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Find the repellent that is right for you by using EPA’s search tool at &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you"&gt;https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you&lt;/a&gt; or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Insect Repellent Chatbot at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/prevention/index.html"&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/prevention/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Wear clothing and gear treated with permethrin.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cover strollers and baby carriers with mosquito netting.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Insect-proof your home by repairing or replacing damaged screens. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reduce standing water on property. Check and drain toys, trays or pots outdoors that can hold water.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Change bird baths, static decorative ponds, and animal water tanks weekly to prevent mosquito larvae that are in the water from becoming adults.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information, visit &lt;a href="https://westnile.idaho.gov"&gt;https://westnile.idaho.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 16:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNdmo4UUJJTWZFb1Q3U3pTUUVhalV0LV9ZZ2tqV19RTGduS0thOHlOMjR6WkktR0pXempqek9FVGJoWU11UlJIaEdFYmNJZ2hBWUJyVHl0eEpVR014eWFpOFFHY1ZkOGJTSHhwWTBvYUVscDQzUkczSDdZaHpSMDJIdGJfdk1VMjU5d1ZqQnRweTdIT3Vm</guid></item><item><title>泛美卫生组织表示，北美麻疹疫情恶化，今年迄今已有18人死亡-路透社</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3gFBVV95cUxQblBGMUdpaTVJcHc5UUcybnlYYjhMa2N5cGg5dFh1TnhSVXBtM21GX1Vsa0ltM2RRWFk5cm02Y29jaTd0Ym81NW9RUlZDeUtHOVBKbVVtSGxpbUlPUm9OMW9BWk5FcEFXMGJqVExKVjdla2M2aFlHOURxODBwaUZvdGg2Nl9XT2IyYnVYUGNyem9udnR4RFR0M3lGOC1HYkFaTGMybnFyRlAzREJobzBoNm02UXp1dTFFS1RUQXJ0a0IxTGliYVJZS1JkalEyVlBiMWg2S2YzYjBJOURkdHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 15:38:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3gFBVV95cUxQblBGMUdpaTVJcHc5UUcybnlYYjhMa2N5cGg5dFh1TnhSVXBtM21GX1Vsa0ltM2RRWFk5cm02Y29jaTd0Ym81NW9RUlZDeUtHOVBKbVVtSGxpbUlPUm9OMW9BWk5FcEFXMGJqVExKVjdla2M2aFlHOURxODBwaUZvdGg2Nl9XT2IyYnVYUGNyem9udnR4RFR0M3lGOC1HYkFaTGMybnFyRlAzREJobzBoNm02UXp1dTFFS1RUQXJ0a0IxTGliYVJZS1JkalEyVlBiMWg2S2YzYjBJOURkdHc</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现人类思维中的一个新故障- Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNWHhsRklZTXBPMnMyR3BvMmNNTFNTaWY3cFZidDBJMko0dENTNkUxUnZSQ3duZlFIdzFDMEdlS2NnQnk2Q21zeW1reHljVjFWaTBTRmpLMVRzQ3lKTXJKeV9MNUFScGJMQ1dLYkt6NUhFbmFDZGlyMkJkVjVjOFBveElpdWVYejVY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none "&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Good news, everyone! Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have coined a new term to describe our brains being dumb. In a recent study, they provide evidence for a distinct but common kind of cognitive bias—one that makes us reluctant to take the easier path in life if it means retracing our steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers have named the bias the “doubling-back aversion.” In several experiments, they found that people often refuse to choose a more efficient solution or route if it requires them to double back on the progress already made. The findings suggest that people’s subjective fear of adding more to their workload and their hesitance to wipe the slate clean contribute to this bias, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Participants’ aversion to feeling their past efforts were a waste encouraged them to pursue less efficient means,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976251331053"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this May in Psychological Science.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Psychologists have detailed all sorts of biases related to digging our feet in when faced with important new information. People tend to stick to the status quo in choosing dinner at a favorite restaurant, for example, even when someone recommends a potentially tastier option. There’s also the sunk cost fallacy, or the reluctance to veer off a disastrous path and choose another simply because they’ve spent so much time or resources pursuing it. The researchers argue that their newly named bias is certainly a close cousin to the sunk cost fallacy and similar biases, but that it ultimately describes a unique type of cognitive pitfall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You’re going the wrong way!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In their paper, they provide the example of someone whose flight from San Francisco to New York becomes massively delayed early on, leaving them stuck in Los Angeles. In one scenario, the traveler can get home three hours earlier than their current itinerary if they accept the airline’s offer of a new flight that first stops in Denver; in the second, the person is instead offered a flight that will also shave three hours off, but they’ll first have to travel back to San Francisco. Despite both flights saving the same amount of time, people are more likely to refuse the one that requires going back to their earlier destination, the paper explains (some people might even refuse the Denver flight, but that would be an example of the status quo bias and/or sunk cost fallacy at work, they note).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, the researchers ran four different types of experiments. The experiments collectively involved more than 2,500 adults, some of whom were UC Berkeley students and others who were volunteers recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. In one test, people were asked to walk along different paths in virtual reality; another asked people to recite as many words starting with the same letter as possible. Across the various tests, the researchers found that people routinely exhibited this aversion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In one experiment where people had to recite words starting with “G,” for instance, everyone was asked midway through if they wanted to stay with the same letter or switch to reciting words starting with “T” (a likely easier letter). In the control condition, this decision was framed as staying on the same task, simply with a new letter, but in the other, people were asked if they wanted to throw out the work they had done so far and start over on a new task. Importantly, the volunteers were also given progress bars for the task, allowing them to see they would perform the same amount of work no matter the choice (though again, “T” would be easier). About 75% of participants made the choice to switch in the control condition, but only 25% did the same when the switch was presented as needing to double back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Backwards feels wrong&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When I was analyzing these results, I was like, ‘Oh, is there a mistake? How can there be such a big difference?'” said lead author Kristine Cho, a behavioral marketing PhD student at UC Berkely’s Haas School of Business, in a &lt;a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/2025-aug-doubling-back-aversion.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; to the Association for Psychological Science, publishers of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Other researchers will have to confirm the team’s findings, of course. And there are still plenty of questions to answer about this aversion, including how often we fall for it and whether it’s more likely to happen in some scenarios than others. But for now, it’s oddly comforting to know that there’s another thing I can possibly blame for my occasional stubbornness to take the faster subway train home.&lt;/p&gt;

It's Fisherman's Feast weekend in the North End. WBUR's Hanna Ali has &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/08/01/italian-feasts-north-end-boston-fishermans-st-anthonys-newsletter"&gt;a guide on what to expect&lt;/a&gt; (the CliffsNotes: &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fishermansfeastboston/video/7269119175522618666"&gt;meatballs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDtAH-biY20"&gt;flying children&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But first, the news:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calling their own shots:&lt;/strong&gt; Massachusetts is eyeing a potential breakup with national vaccine guidelines, as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overhauls federal policy. As part of &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-healey-files-245-billion-supplemental-budget-to-close-fiscal-year-2025"&gt;a larger supplemental spending bill filed yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, Gov. Maura Healey proposed giving the state’s Department of Public Health authority to "decouple" local immunization recommendations and requirements from federal standards. If passed, Healey's office said DPH could set independent standards for Massachusetts, "if the federal government fails to maintain a robust schedule of vaccine recommendations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;ul&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Why it matters: Typically, health insurance companies only agree to cover shots that have been recommended by &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5429604/cdc-rfk-acip-vaccine-committee"&gt;an important advisory panel for the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. In June, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428533/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-committee-acip"&gt;dismissed the entire panel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5430870/cdc-vaccine-experts-rfk-jr"&gt;appointed a new slate of members&lt;/a&gt; who have already given credence to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5438485/cdc-acip-rfk-thimerosal-vaccines"&gt;debunked fears&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines. The panel has also yet to release guidelines for COVID vaccines this fall, after the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/03/nx-s1-5421292/covid-vaccine-cdc-pregnant-kids-recommendations"&gt;dropped its recommendation for healthy adults&lt;/a&gt; under the age of 65 in May.&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Healey's proposal came a day after The Boston Globe &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/13/metro/vaccine-kennedy-massachusetts-inoculations-shots-children-covid-flu/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that state health officials have been talking to peers in Connecticut, Maine, New York and Rhode Island about coordinating vaccine guidelines. The states would base their recommendations on advice from national professional groups, like the American Academy of Pediatrics, instead of the CDC. The coordinated guidelines could increase the odds that insurers cover the shots without federal approval, experts told the Globe. (While people could also still get shots without insurance paying for it, the COVID vaccine can cost up to $200 per shot.)&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;The concern: Massachusetts Department of Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein stressed that any potential break from federal policy must be a group effort, adding he's "incredibly worried" about individual states separately coming out with their own recommendations. "Even if those recommendations are fully based in science, the fact that they're coming out differently from different states is going to infuse the pretense of politicization into the recommendation process," Goldstein said during a meeting this week. "And so I've really encouraged the other state health officers — in particular in the Northeast, but anyone who will listen — to look to [groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics]."&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Zoom out: The debate comes as many Americans pass up vaccines. This past respiratory virus season, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html"&gt;less than half&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. adults got a flu shot and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/index.html"&gt;less than a quarter&lt;/a&gt; got a COVID booster, according to CDC data. Meanwhile, DPH &lt;a href="https://www.wwlp.com/news/massachusetts/flu-covid-19-vaccination-rates-falling-among-health-care-workers/"&gt;reported this week&lt;/a&gt; that vaccination rates among Massachusetts health care workers are falling. For both flu and (especially) COVID shots, not one health care sector (e.g., hospitals, nursing homes, EMS) met the state's 90% vaccination goal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New perk: &lt;/strong&gt;The Boys and Girls Club of Boston is waiving membership fees for families this school year. Currently, the annual fees are $25 dollars for children between ages 6 and 12, and $5 for teens. BGCB President and CEO Robert Lewis Jr. said it can add up for the families the club serves in Boston and Chelsea, most of whom live below the poverty level. "We don't want the finances to be a burden in a time when parents are trying to figure out how to stretch a dollar," he told WBUR's Amy Sokolow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;ul&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;In other youth sports news: &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/braintree-little-league-world-series-loss-irmo-south-carolina/"&gt;Things did not go great&lt;/a&gt; for the Braintree boys baseball team during their Little League World Series debut yesterday. They lost 13-0 to South Carolina (thanks in large part to a &lt;a href="https://x.com/espn/status/1956089622577950951"&gt;grand slam hitting&lt;/a&gt;, 75 mph-throwing pitcher on the opposing team). But it's not over yet. Braintree plays the team from Lamar, Texas, tomorrow at 3 p.m. in the elimination bracket.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stamp acts: &lt;/strong&gt;The U.S. Postal Service unveiled yesterday two new Boston-themed stamps. One depicts Old North Church and the other shows a Paul Revere-esque midnight rider. They're meant to commemorate both 250 years since the American Revolution and the Boston 2026 World Expo, a major international stamp show coming to the city next May. (Coincidentally, the official stamp release came on &lt;a href="https://store.usps.com/store/product/boston-2026-world-stamp-show-stamps-S_487304"&gt;the 260th anniversary of the start of the Stamp Act protests&lt;/a&gt; in Boston.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heads up: &lt;/strong&gt;The MBTA is shutting down the entire Lowell commuter rail line this weekend and next (starting each Friday at 10 p.m.) due to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CzHDVaJuffW/"&gt;a bridge replacement project&lt;/a&gt; in Somerville. Riders have &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; different shuttle bus options for backup, all of which are free. Here's a look at &lt;a href="https://x.com/MBTA_CR/status/1955584374881038846"&gt;the shuttle routes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cdn.mbta.com/sites/default/files/media/route_pdfs/2025-08-12-cr-lowell-line-shuttle-bus-schedule.pdf"&gt;schedules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;P.S.— What sea creature was recently spotted off the coast of Massachusetts for the first time in almost a decade?

While the city is not required to regularly inspect cooling towers, health department spokesperson Chantal Gomez said the agency aims to inspect every tower annually. She added that staff shortages have made that difficult in recent years, but the agency is continuing to recruit inspectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="4pif4"&gt;Harlem Hospital, a city-run medical center where many Legionnaires’ patients in the current outbreak have been treated, also tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="f5fcq"&gt;City officials said they are still working to confirm which specific cooling tower caused the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fadhi"&gt;Legionella bacteria can grow in buildings’ water-cooling towers and then get spewed into the air with the mist the towers emit. If it’s inhaled, Legionella can cause Legionnaires’ disease, a severe form of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6nunu"&gt;The city previously said 11 cooling towers in the area had tested positive for Legionella through an initial screening process, but declined to share their addresses at the time. City officials said they have now completed a more rigorous form of testing and found 12 cooling towers that tested positive. All but one have already undergone remediation and the final one will undergo remediation by tomorrow, city officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="c3od2"&gt;The number of new cases of Legionnaires’ being reported has begun to decline, suggesting that the bacteria's source has been contained, acting city Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said at a press conference on the outbreak at Harlem Hospital Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7fmev"&gt;“I want to assure everyone the air is safe to breathe,” Mayor Eric Adams said at the press conference, held hours before the fourth death was announced. “I know the Central Harlem community and so many New Yorkers are anxious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1qthm"&gt;In recent weeks, the city has advised people who live and work in the ZIP codes affected by the outbreak (10027, 10030, 10035, 10037 and 10039) to seek medical attention immediately if they experience symptoms associated with Legionnaires’, including cough, trouble breathing, fever, chills or muscle aches. Legionnaires’ can be treated effectively with antibiotics if it’s caught early, city health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fvq1o"&gt;Morse said she and other city health workers have been busy spreading the word about Legionnaires’ to keep people safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5iqm5"&gt;But some Harlem residents criticized the city for not previously releasing the addresses of the water-cooling towers that initially screened positive for Legionella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7ksqn"&gt;Morse &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/acting-nyc-health-commissioner-defends-citys-communications-on-legionnaires-disease" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;defended&lt;/a&gt; the move on WNYC earlier this week, saying, “The reason we have yet to release the building locations, again, is because of this concern that we’d be giving people a false sense of security before our investigation is really fully complete.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="a587t"&gt;At the time, Morse said that because Legionella can travel through the air, everyone in the five affected ZIP codes should be vigilant about Legionnaires’ symptoms, regardless of whether they live near the buildings that tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ajh70"&gt;State Sen. Cordell Cleare, a Harlem Democrat, said she plans to push for new state legislation to improve cooling tower regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3t202"&gt;“As much as we’ve responded to this, three lives is too many,” Cleare said. “Our communities cannot continue to serve as the canary in the coal mine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="69hpi"&gt;A Gothamist analysis of public data found that city &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/legionnaires-inspections-sank-to-near-record-low-ahead-of-nyc-outbreak" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;inspections have dropped off&lt;/a&gt; significantly since they started in 2017.

By adjusting the diameter of nerve fibers, longer retinal axons transmit signals faster, ensuring they arrive in near-perfect sync with shorter ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process reduces timing differences to just milliseconds, preserving a unified visual experience. The finding challenges the long-held assumption that such synchronization occurs only in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built-In Synchronization:&lt;/strong&gt; Longer retinal nerve fibers are thicker, enabling faster conduction to match shorter pathways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Millisecond Precision:&lt;/strong&gt; Timing differences are reduced to just a few milliseconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond the Brain:&lt;/strong&gt; Visual timing coordination starts in the retina, not solely in the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;IOB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perception depends not only on what we see, but also on when we see it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signals initiated by light-sensitive cells in the retina travel through nerve fibers of varying lengths before converging at the optic nerve and continuing to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even neighboring cells in the central retina can transmit signals over very different distances – raising the question of how the brain avoids receiving a scrambled or delayed picture of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture decoding="async" class="wp-image-112235"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/retina-vision-neurosicnce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/retina-vision-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/retina-vision-neurosicnce-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/retina-vision-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/retina-vision-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/retina-vision-neurosicnce-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/retina-vision-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/retina-vision-neurosicnce.jpg" alt="This shows neurons in the retina." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/retina-vision-neurosicnce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/retina-vision-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/retina-vision-neurosicnce-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/retina-vision-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/retina-vision-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/retina-vision-neurosicnce-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/retina-vision-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;onger axons of retinal ganglion cells have larger diameters and faster conduction speeds, which helps align signal arrival times. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published by researchers of the Institute of Molecular and Clinical Ophthalmology Basel (IOB) in Nature Neuroscience shows that differences in the speed and distance of nerve signals are actively balanced within the human eye itself to support a unified and temporally accurate visual experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key findings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Axonal tuning in the human retina&lt;/strong&gt;: Longer axons of retinal ganglion cells have larger diameters and faster conduction speeds, which helps align signal arrival times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision in milliseconds&lt;/strong&gt;: This mechanism helps align the timing of signals from different parts of the retina, reducing differences in arrival time to just a few milliseconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple layers of compensation&lt;/strong&gt;: Alongside axon speed, other factors like the initial response time of retinal cells and further adjustments in the brain contribute to synchronization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;IOB researchers reveal that the fine-tuning of visual timing in humans begins not in the brain but in the retina, thus challenging previous assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They show that this built-in compensation helps maintain the clarity and consistency of what we see – despite structural differences in how signals are routed through the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings raise important questions about how nerve fibers are adjusted during development – for example, how their diameter is regulated and how their membranes help control the speed of signal transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these mechanisms could reveal fundamental principles of temporal coordination in the brain, with relevance well beyond the visual system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#690c051a08471a000e050c2900060b470a01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elsa Sigle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://iob.ch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IOB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Elsa Sigle – IOB&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02011-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Synchronization of visual perception within the human fovea&lt;/a&gt;” by Felix Franke et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synchronization of visual perception within the human fovea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human brain constructs a model of the world by processing sensory signals with distinct temporal characteristics that may differ in generation and transmission speed within a single sensory modality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To perceive simultaneous events as occurring at the same time, the brain must synchronize this sensory information, yet the mechanisms underlying such synchronization remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining human neural recordings, behavioral measurements and modeling, we show that in the human visual system, this process begins in the fovea centralis, the retinal region used for reading and recognizing faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaction times to foveal single-cone photostimulation were similar across the central visual field, although visual information from neighboring foveal cones travels along axons of highly different lengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From direct measurements of action potential propagation speeds, axon diameters and lengths in the human fovea centralis, we found that longer foveal axons have larger diameters and increased propagation speeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conclude that the human brain orchestrates axonal conduction speeds of unmyelinated axons in the retina to synchronize the arrival times of sensory signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest a previously unknown mechanism by which the human brain synchronizes perception.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Charles Gerba, a professor of microbiology and public health at the University of Arizona, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/brain-eating-infections-could-become-more-common-scientists-warn"&gt;Live Science&lt;/a&gt;: 'What you might see is spikes in these organisms after an extreme weather event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So the more nutrients in the water, the more bacteria you'll get. We're seeing it creeping up to states further and further north all the time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Missouri lake where the latest case has emerged is a man-made reservoir created in 1931 with the completion of Bagnell Dam on the Osage River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today, it draws tens of thousands of visitors with dozens of picturesque swimming spots, along with fishing and watersports activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There had been no prior warnings about the lake being contaminated with bacteria or other harmful organisms and health experts say that despite the recent incident, there is not an elevated risk associated with the body of water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To reduce the risk of infection in warm freshwater health officials have advised swimmers to hold their noses shut, to keep their heads above water, to avoid activities in the water during periods of high temperatures and to avoid digging sediment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US only suffers a handful of deaths from brain-eating amoebas each year, usually among people swimming &lt;a class="" href="/health/article-11062301/Brain-eating-amoeba-hiding-rivers-lakes-America-summer.html" target="_self"&gt;in warm water lakes and rivers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-282400b0-792e-11f0-a137-95e9d181ae1e" class=""&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; is among the states that have suffered the largest burden of brain-eating amoeba cases, with 39 of the 164 cases recorded in the US occurring in the Lone Star state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The single-cell organism, which thrives in warm waters, kills 97 percent of the people it infects as it causes a disease called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, also known as PAM or amebic meningitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initial symptoms include a headache, vomiting and nausea. A person can then suffer cognitive issues and a stiff neck as things progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes severe swelling, and eventually rotting, of the brain and spinal cord. This will almost always eventually lead to death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no known effective treatments for PAM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A total of 157 Naegleria fowleri cases were reported in the US from 1962 to 2022, the latest map available, with a state-by-state breakdown shown above.

If water containing the amoeba enters the nose, it will likely lead to infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingesting water through the mouth is ok because stomach acid is strong enough to kill the amoeba. The nose is its only route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once a person's olfactory nerve is exposed, it can take around one to nine days to start experiencing symptoms. They will usually die within five days of symptoms first appearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's quite rapid, it's very progressive. It literally eats the brain tissue,' Dr Anjan Debnath, a parasitologist at the University of California San Diego, explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of the rare infection, doctors also often misdiagnose symptoms as meningitis - wasting valuable time that could be used to treat the parasite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Debnath describes the infection as taking part in two stages. The first is relatively minor, with the person experiencing a headache and other flu-like symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means that unless a doctor knows that a person has been swimming in untreated water they may not even suspect the amoeba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once symptoms reach the second stage, a person will start experiencing severe neurological issues like seizures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A doctor will then likely find out about the infection through a spinal fluid test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;America suffers around three cases of the amoeba each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They will almost always occur over summer, when many families flock to local lakes and ponds for a daytime outing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Debnath still advises against swimming in untreated water over summer, especially in places like Florida and Texas where temperatures get exceptionally high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because the amoeba only resides in fresh water, swimming in the ocean is generally safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If families do choose to visit a freshwater beach, anyone entering the water should wear a nose clip to prevent water from entering their nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Debnath also recommends against kicking up dirt or sand from the bottom of the lake as warmer areas deep down are where the microscopic beings usually lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study checked the blood of about 300 firefighters from four departments across the country who were exposed to high levels of Pfas. The chemicals are the main ingredient in most firefighting foam, and are frequently used in “turnout gear” worn by firefighters because of their heat repelling properties&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Furlong said she was surprised to find the number of genes and biological pathways that were impacted by Pfas, which suggests the chemicals may cause or contribute to a broad range of health problems. The study did not prove the chemicals cause certain diseases, but findings point to biological changes that might precede disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Genes play a range of roles in developing or preventing disease, and Pfas essentially change the way the genes are supposed to act, Furlong said. A gene may act as tumor suppressor, but the Pfas interferes with how it expresses, which affects whether cancer develops, or the type of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For example, PFOS, among the most common and dangerous Pfas compounds, reduces levels of miR-128-1-5p, a gene tied to cancer development. Branched forms of PFOS were linked to changes in five other genes, including some that regulate cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Detox Your Kitchen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"detox-your-kitchen","successDescription":"A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries."}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Vitamin B12 deficiency isn't too common. Still, there are a few situations where supplemental vitamin B12 should be considered, and two of them are specific for people with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People with Type 1 diabetes, which usually presents itself during childhood, are at a high risk for other autoimmune diseases, including pernicious anemia — an autoimmune destruction of the cells in the stomach that make a protein called intrinsic factor. This protein is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. Multiple autoimmune diseases are often diagnosed in the same person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; R&lt;a href="/story/life/advice/2025/08/13/dr-roach-rash-and-hives-develop-after-taking-an-aramotase-inhibitor/85507213007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/life/advice/2025/08/13/dr-roach-rash-and-hives-develop-after-taking-an-aramotase-inhibitor/85507213007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ash and hives develop after taking an aramotase inhibitor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People with Type 2 diabetes who take metformin are at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency due to poor absorption. I recommend testing vitamin B12 in people who have been on metformin for a long time. Proton-pump inhibitors (like omeprazole) may also reduce B12 absorption to the point of deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People who are very strict with avoiding any type of animal products will develop B12 deficiency over the years unless they use supplements. Finally, people who can't absorb nutrients for a variety of reasons (such as bariatric surgery, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, bacterial overgrowth, fish tapeworm, and disease of the pancreas) may all become B12-deficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Treatment of B12 deficiency depends on the underlying cause. For example, a vegan only needs about 1 mcg a day to avoid B12 deficiency. By contrast, people with pernicious anemia need 1,000 times the usual oral dose of B12 or B12 injections. Measuring B12 levels to ensure adequate supplementation is wise in people who have difficulty absorbing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For healthy people (apart from the above and a few other rare conditions) with a non-vegan diet, it is not necessary to supplement B12, nor is testing necessary. B12 toxicity is essentially unheard of since the body simply excretes the B12 that you don't need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Apart from severe absorption problems like pernicious anemia, the dosing of B12 supplementation is the same whether a person has diabetes or not. Fifty micrograms a day is almost always more than enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; Is the Naltrexone shot (for alcohol abstinence) more effective when given on one side of the body compared to the other? A person I know who receives the shots feels that it's only effective when they receive it on their right buttock. Is this possible, or could they be noticing a placebo effect?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— C.M.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear C.M.:&lt;/strong&gt; Naltrexone is an effective treatment for people with alcohol dependence. The exact effectiveness depends on the setting, but people who use naltrexone are less likely to relapse on their drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Of course the drug will be absorbed just as well from the left side as the right. However, our expectations can have a huge influence on the effectiveness of a treatment. When there is an expectation of benefit, there is a placebo effect. (When there is an expectation of harm, it's called a nocebo effect.) The placebo effect isn't as critical in a situation like antibiotics for pneumonia but can be of immense importance when the desired effect is a decrease in alcohol cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If I were this person's doctor, I would keep giving the injection on their right side.&lt;em&gt; Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 11:39:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxNNWVkY05RV25zUEFuYXlIb1hzM0Zja294V0N2b005RmJiRmU3aUZNZlV4aE1memRSNkRCMGpEa1RBRW81RmY0ZU1NZkNWdXphSDFZOVM0NVJNTG5WbVc1VE92WWlURGN1M1Z4dzlScW9xOWV6c1Nzc2t4bDJTbmxMZndaeHFhZ1kxR20wZzVwQUpEaEFrUGNfRWM1N2RUaDhHRXU5d3VORlBmMTZBQ3BnSWx5Z3BRWEROUW9KSUY5ZHR2Ml9yajJ1SHlWVHI5MGtBRWU1Sg</guid></item><item><title>“只是时间问题” ：海水变暖将使感染科德角游泳者的食肉细菌更常见-波士顿环球报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxOUWh0MGw4WGdrTm9JUmw2elU0SlBpTlVUbVF5ZlpNdVVnWmhqSVlieXoxNXJtdGhSbVdvSFBQUXhOUHVEYkNSTl8wQUZLWkhPbTVmSzdSY1EtcVJ5eEFpeW10eTRTRHRScnF3eGtib09yZkI2Q2N3VVoyUjdnZzN4cjk4cklCMlhmNkctVm9Pa21sRkw0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That’s where climate change comes in, making New England waters friendlier for the potentially deadly bacteria.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“With warmer water temperatures moving further north, it allows Vibrios to survive, during summer months in particular, at higher latitudes than it had previously,” said Hamer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And the water is warmer. Midsummer ocean temperatures were about 2.75 degrees warmer in the period from 2021 to 2025 than they were 20 years ago, according to data from an &lt;a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/physocean.html?bdate=20250715&amp;amp;edate=20250815&amp;amp;units=standard&amp;amp;timezone=GMT&amp;amp;id=8447930&amp;amp;interval=6" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/physocean.html?bdate=20250715&amp;amp;edate=20250815&amp;amp;units=standard&amp;amp;timezone=GMT&amp;amp;id=8447930&amp;amp;interval=6"&gt;ocean temperature monitor&lt;/a&gt; in Woods Hole, near where the swimmer contracted the virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“A couple degrees difference will allow greater growth” of the bacteria, said Hamer. “And if it continues to rise, we’re going to see even more over the next five to 10 years.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The oceans absorb more than 90 percent of the extra heat created by climate change, leading to sea level rise as water molecules expand and glaciers melt; supplying&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;extra energy for hurricanes, which are fueled by heat at the surface of the ocean; and providing a more hospitable place for certain kinds of bacteria. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Scientists has been watching as Vibrio vulnificus infections have climbed northward as the planet warms. Between 1988 and 2018, wound infections from the bacteria increased eight-fold (from 10 to 80 cases per year) in the eastern United States, and the northern limit of reported cases moved north by roughly 30 miles each year, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-28247-2" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-28247-2"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Nature. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;By the middle of this century, between 2041 and 2060, the authors of the study projected that Vibrio vulnificus would be occurring as far north as Boston, and found that in a scenario where the world does not sufficiently rein in greenhouse gas emissions, caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels, it could extend into southern Maine toward the end of the century. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The good news is, as of now, this kind of infection is very rare in Massachusetts. The state has recorded seven cases of Vibrio vulnificus in the last several years, of which just four were likely exposed in Massachusetts. But Department of Public Health officials want to &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/department-of-public-health-alerts-public-to-rare-vibrio-vulnificus-bacteria-in-coastal-waters" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/news/department-of-public-health-alerts-public-to-rare-vibrio-vulnificus-bacteria-in-coastal-waters"&gt;get the word out&lt;/a&gt; because, when people do contract an infection from the bacteria, the stakes are high. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;One in five people with a Vibrio vulnificus infection die, sometimes within a day or two of getting sick, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;. Others may end up needing an amputation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There are increasing numbers of people who are immunocompromised by disease or by medication, and people in those categories are at higher risk of both contracting the disease and developing severe complications of the disease,” said &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/ceid/about-the-center/team/larry-madoff-md/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bu.edu/ceid/about-the-center/team/larry-madoff-md/"&gt;Larry Madoff&lt;/a&gt;, medical director of the state Department of Public Health. “And this is the time of year, right?

The 10-year low was in 2016, when there was less than a quarter of what there is now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year’s total of&lt;a class="link" href="https://public-usa.mkt.dynamics.com/api/orgs/24ac4e14-c54e-4da4-af0e-09805e16f9b9/r/PbwjSQQkx0ykda8GlWUBAAYAAAA?msdynmkt_target=%7B%22TargetUrl%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fwww.cdph.ca.gov%252FPrograms%252FCID%252FDCDC%252FPages%252FValleyFeverDashboard.aspx%22%2C%22RedirectOptions%22%3A%7B%225%22%3Anull%2C%221%22%3Anull%7D%7D&amp;amp;msdynmkt_digest=eFsqi8wNqejgxkE4PU11oNV%2Fdj%2FNAJUbCpHANLakILc%3D&amp;amp;msdynmkt_secretVersion=a3955a744d9049f88dd8bdc1907bf2bf" target="_blank"&gt; nearly 12,500 cases&lt;/a&gt; is the most on record for California and far more than the 7,000 to 9,000 cases per year the state averaged between 2016 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“California had a record year for Valley fever in 2024 and, so far, case counts are high in 2025. Valley fever is a serious illness that’s here to stay in California,” said Erica Pan, director of the state public health department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials say the current count is likely to be revised upward as there are often delays in reporting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valley fever is most prevalent in the San Joaquin Valley and southern part of the state where the fungus, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;occidioides&lt;/i&gt;, thrives in dry, arid soil. Case numbers are also climbing in the northern Central Valley, though, and along the state’s Central Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(22)00202-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;Researchers speculate&lt;/a&gt; the rise is tied to patterns of drought and precipitation. Periods of severe drought followed by wet winter and dry summer seem to coincide with more people getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also suspect &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-04-04/how-climate-change-is-making-valley-fever-worse"&gt;climate change has expanded the fungi’s range&lt;/a&gt; into areas where it was previously rare. For instance, since 2023, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx#notes" target="_blank"&gt;Monterey County’s case numbers have exploded&lt;/a&gt;. There were 47 cases in 2023 and 348 this year as of July 31. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases also doubled since 2023 in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx#notes" target="_blank"&gt;Contra Costa, Fresno, San Luis Obispo and Merced&lt;/a&gt; counties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People contract Valley fever by inhaling the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;occidioides&lt;/i&gt; spores, released when wind, wildfire, tractors, bulldozers, digging or even dancing disturbs the soil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, at least 19 people who &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-10-02/the-threat-of-valley-fever-is-growing-in-central-california"&gt;attended Lightning in a Bottle, a five-day music and art festival held at Buena Vista lake in Kern County&lt;/a&gt;, got sick — including several with pneumonia-like symptoms, rashes, headaches and exhaustion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most people infected won’t get symptoms and will fight off the infection naturally. Those who do feel sick may be hard-pressed to know what they have, since the symptoms are similar to COVID or the flu, further complicating efforts to address the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to remind Californians, travelers to California and their healthcare providers to watch for signs and symptoms of Valley fever to help detect it early,” Pan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, the fungus can spread to other parts of the body and cause severe disease or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valley fever is not contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pan urged people to seek help from a medical provider if they’ve had a cough, fever, trouble breathing and tiredness for more than 7 to 10 days — especially if they’ve been outdoors in dusty air in the Central Valley or Central Coast regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pets are also susceptible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said people can reduce their risk while traveling in the San Joaquin Valley and much of the southwestern United States by staying indoors and keeping doors and windows closed when it’s windy; keeping car windows closed and using recirculated air instead of fresh; wetting soil before digging or disrupting; and wearing a properly fitted N95 mask if the outdoors can’t be avoided.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNQ3psRE80ZUNMZThUczQ2UmlZT3hPRjFhdTJFbFVQNk02ZE5pQlo4S0JGV2N0LUVuXzhudktvNUFjRzc4cDA5NnJmSTB5T0xtTDZRaGdiaWxkVzhobUJHZDEyeVhVOGNwM2t0NW1wT2xiUldtdUlSOC1HM1lXY3FZVFZLZnh3LXBwVTgw</guid></item><item><title>根据心脏外科医生的说法，纯素食者和素食者的5种最佳蛋白质来源-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigJBVV95cUxNazN1THlCUjFFYUNBUVVtR2RtSGtiS1M0Q21CazREUjZSTnNKaW5udXpvMl9MU0YxQnBWVURNbHUtd2M5NVJ1SGNRY0pEeklhd0ZUWEVDQ1dRNnlUOU5GdXJ5LU4wNmNKQktTUFVnTjU3T3BscXBvVklya1JrVmphSmNiVGpPNGpLRGRZZGlHSUNPWmRjc19FODRrS01hOWF3emVIWjVYelJfWWdOWEJfTmJkZ1BLTjExbHBZWGdhTlQ5eXdWRFFEM2g1N0szNWFXRzc0Mm90WDlsdmhNcHJjT3JPalFUWXRiVmFDcGlHQlM0MEk4MTdBTUl2TjRMLVZ1TzhnQ19Xck9IZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is essential for many body processes. It is the building block for muscles, bones, cartilage, skin, and blood. Protein also plays a crucial role in the production of enzymes, hormones, and antibodies. It also helps in cell repair, growth, and various metabolic processes. You are supposed to get 10% of your daily calories from protein. But does that necessarily mean consuming a lot of meat every day? Higher amount of meat intake is also linked to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34587250/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000210286" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, and even &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27597529/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Also, what about vegans and vegetarians? How do they get their protein? Dr. Steven Gundry, MD, a former cardiac surgeon and bestselling author, has recently shared some of the high-protein sources that involve no animal meat. Take a look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Lentils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lentils are of the best sources of plant-based protein you can get. One cup (198g) of cooked lentils contains 18 g of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/172421/nutrients" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. It is also low in calories and is rich in resistant starch and prebiotic fiber, which is good for the gut microbiome. Your gut is going to thank you because a single cup of lentils will give you half of your recommended daily fiber. “Soak or pressure-cook lentils to reduce lectins, which can impact or slow down nutrient absorption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can add lentils to soups, stews, or homemade veggie burgers,” the cardiac surgeon told CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Flaxseeds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the most underrated protein source. They are an excellent source of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4375225/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, omega-3s, and lignans, which have hormone-balancing benefits. The doctor recommends consuming ground flaxseeds because the whole ones are difficult to digest, and the bioavailability of their beneficial compounds suffers. The doctor revealed that he keeps a bag of organic whole flax in the refrigerator and grinds it as needed to ensure freshness. You can add them to smoothies, sprinkle them on salads, or oats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Barù nuts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another good protein source, Dr. Gundry suggests, is Barù nuts. They are native to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20564449/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and are loaded with protein. It has more protein than any other nut. Also rich in antioxidants and fiber, these nuts have an earthy flavour. They are available in grocery stores and online. The doctor reveals that he munches on a handful of nuts daily. “They taste like a cross between peanuts and almonds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Spirulina&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, spirulina, the blue-green algae, is a protein-dense food. About 70% of it is protein. Also rich in iron, B vitamins, and a powerful antioxidant called phycocyanin, spirulina can boost brain and immune function. “Try adding spirulina to your smoothies or juices. You can also substitute it with chlorella, another nutrient-rich alga, in powder or tablet form,” he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;6 Foods that help you poop better and relieve constipation in the morning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sorghum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are sick of eating quinoa or couscous, try &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666833524000297" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;sorghum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. This ancient grain is an excellent source of protein. One cup of sorghum has about 21 g of protein, which is about twice what quinoa can provide! You can also grind it into flour and use it to bake, and also make pasta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 08:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigJBVV95cUxNazN1THlCUjFFYUNBUVVtR2RtSGtiS1M0Q21CazREUjZSTnNKaW5udXpvMl9MU0YxQnBWVURNbHUtd2M5NVJ1SGNRY0pEeklhd0ZUWEVDQ1dRNnlUOU5GdXJ5LU4wNmNKQktTUFVnTjU3T3BscXBvVklya1JrVmphSmNiVGpPNGpLRGRZZGlHSUNPWmRjc19FODRrS01hOWF3emVIWjVYelJfWWdOWEJfTmJkZ1BLTjExbHBZWGdhTlQ5eXdWRFFEM2g1N0szNWFXRzc0Mm90WDlsdmhNcHJjT3JPalFUWXRiVmFDcGlHQlM0MEk4MTdBTUl2TjRMLVZ1TzhnQ19Xck9IZw</guid></item><item><title>使用这6种最佳维生素和补充剂改善眼睛健康- CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPZnI5ZnQ5aEpXZkk2WlBOQ196NlM1R1NTYWktZm1mT2Y3OXNqSFV3WUtqUnljSUtpWk1PclBBeUptSjNnR2xESWJkakRfSEVTb2wxXzBZWXNxTlF3WEpybmVtN1dCbU5hRVVaRXcyWmdHNHpaUWZhU1B3d2Q2aG83cGVqZ0tzYlB5aW5IVExOQXpUZkJpdDRKblV0YjNPNXhIVDF0RjRfTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;The bright summer sunshine can do wonders for your &lt;a target="_self" data-id="53926bae-a8b2-465f-b67a-46217aa92fcd" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/spring-into-mental-wellness-8-hobbies-that-can-boost-your-happiness/" class="editor-rtfLink"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, but the increase in allergens and &lt;a target="_self" data-id="53926bae-a8b2-465f-b67a-46217aa92fcd" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/personal-care/how-to-protect-your-eyes-from-the-suns-uv-rays/" class="editor-rtfLink"&gt;harmful UV rays&lt;/a&gt; is not as kind to your eyes.

    &lt;p&gt;When you order a coffee, do you ask for it to be “extra hot”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you enjoy tea, coffee or something else, hot drinks are a comforting and often highly personal ritual. The exact temperature to brew tea or serve coffee for the best flavour is &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-11-30/ordering-extra-hot-coffee-does-it-change-flavour/101708102"&gt;hotly debated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there may be something else you’re not considering: your health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, hot drinks can be too hot – and are even linked to cancer. So, let’s take a look at the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What’s the link between hot drinks and cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence for a link between hot drinks and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20395127/"&gt;throat&lt;/a&gt; cancer and the evidence for a link between hot drinks and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22296352/"&gt;stomach cancer&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2363606/pdf/84-6691561a.pdf"&gt;unclear&lt;/a&gt;. But there is a link between hot drinks and cancers of the “food pipe” or &lt;a href="https://www.canceraustralia.gov.au/cancer-types/oesophageal-cancer"&gt;oesophagus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the International Agency for Research on Cancer &lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pr244_E.pdf"&gt;classified&lt;/a&gt; drinking very hot beverages, meaning above 65°C, as “probably carcinogenic to humans” – this is the &lt;a href="https://monographs.iarc.who.int/list-of-classifications"&gt;same risk&lt;/a&gt; category as emissions from indoor wood smoke or eating a lot of red meat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agency’s report found it was the temperature, not the drinks, that were responsible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is based mainly on evidence from &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3947123/"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;, where studies found a link between drinking a lot of maté – a traditional herbal drink usually drunk &lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pr244_E.pdf"&gt;at around&lt;/a&gt; 70°C – and a higher risk of oesophageal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar studies in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7477845/"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35768549/"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19123468/"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; have also supported the link between drinking very hot beverages and developing oesophageal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, until recently we didn’t have substantial research exploring this link in Europe and other Western populations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41416-025-02953-2"&gt;a large study&lt;/a&gt; of almost half a million adults in the United Kingdom confirmed drinking higher amounts of very hot drinks (tea and coffee) was associated with oesophageal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study found that someone who drank eight or more cups a day of very hot tea or coffee was almost six times more likely to develop oesophageal cancer, compared to someone who didn’t drink hot drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How do hot drinks cause cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drinking a lot of very hot drinks can damage cells in the oesophagus lining, and it’s believed over time this can lead to cancer developing. Researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.24445"&gt;first proposed&lt;/a&gt; this link almost 90 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we know about how hot drinks can damage the oesophagus mainly comes from animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very hot water may accelerate cancer growth. One &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexmp.2016.02.005"&gt;animal study&lt;/a&gt; from 2016 studied mice that were prone to developing cancer. Mice given very hot water (70°C) were more likely to develop precancerous growths in the oesophagus, and sooner, compared to mice given water at lower temperatures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpgi.1999.276.6.G1322"&gt;Another theory&lt;/a&gt; is that heat damage to the oesophagus lining weakens its normal barrier, increasing the risk of further damage from gastric acid reflux (from the stomach). Over time, this chronic damage can increase the chance of oesophageal cancer developing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does how much you drink matter?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of cancer may depend on how much hot liquid you drink in one sitting and how quickly. It seems drinking a lot in one go is more likely to damage the oesophagus by causing a heat injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.13.1.24"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers measured the temperature inside the oesophagus of people drinking hot coffee at different temperatures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found the size of the sip the person took had more impact than how hot the drink was. A very big sip (20 millilitres) of 65°C coffee increased the temperature inside the oesophagus by up to 12°C. Over time, large sips can lead to sustained heat injury that can damage cells. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The occasional small sip of coffee at 65°C isn’t likely to result in any long-term problems. But over years, drinking large amounts of very hot drinks could very well increase the risk of oesophageal cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So, what’s a safe temperature?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1750-3841.14699"&gt;brewing temperatures&lt;/a&gt; for drinks such as coffee are very high – often close to the boiling point of water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, takeaway hot drinks &lt;a href="https://foodsci.oregonstate.edu/sites/agscid7/files/foodsci/attachments/hot-bev-temp.pdf"&gt;may be sometimes&lt;/a&gt; be served at very high temperatures (around 90°C) to allow for cooling when people drink them later at the office or home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18226454/"&gt;One study from the United States&lt;/a&gt; calculated the ideal temperature for coffee, factoring in the risk of heat injury to the oesophagus while preserving flavour and taste. The researchers came up with an optimum temperature of 57.8°C. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tips to consume hot drinks safely&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slow down, take your time and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing time for a very hot drink to cool is important and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.14699"&gt;research has shown&lt;/a&gt; a hot drink’s temperature can drop by 10–15°C in five minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things that may help cool a hot drink: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, small sips are a good idea to test the temperature, given we know having a large amount has a significant impact on &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1411981/"&gt;the temperature inside the oesophagus&lt;/a&gt; and potential damage to its lining.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A new test helps predict which kids face the largest genetic risk of a high body mass index (BMI) later in life. That could help parents establish healthy habits early on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new test, put together by a large team of international researchers, is what's known as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygenic_score"&gt;polygenic score&lt;/a&gt; or PGS. These scores are used to group genetic variations to predict a certain characteristic, which in this case is BMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-5-days-of-junk-food-can-trigger-obesitys-hold-on-your-brain"&gt;Just 5 Days of Junk Food Can Trigger Obesity's Hold on Your Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What makes the score so powerful is its ability to predict, before the age of five, whether a child is likely to develop obesity in adulthood, well before other risk factors start to shape their weight later in childhood," &lt;a href="https://cbmr.ku.dk/news/2025/genetic-test-predicts-obesity-in-childhood/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; genetic epidemiologist Roelof Smit, from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Intervening at this point can have a huge impact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that the test isn't quite as straightforward as it might sound. For one, genetics only accounts for a relatively small proportion of risk for high BMI. And secondly, a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/two-weeks-ago-the-bmi-was-quietly-wound-back-as-the-go-to-weight-measure-in-the-us"&gt;growing body of research&lt;/a&gt; is suggesting we move away from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-obesity-definition-shifts-focus-from-bmi-heres-the-science-behind-it"&gt;BMI as a measure of obesity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bmi-is-an-awful-predictor-of-early-death-weve-had-a-better-option-for-decades"&gt;health in general&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the researchers claim the new PGS test is up to twice as accurate as others of its type. It was built from a database of genetic information collected from more than 5.1 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After compiling the test, the researchers then tried it out on several separate health databases, covering hundreds of thousands of individuals. In these datasets, both genetic data and BMI over time had been recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers added the PGS to other predictors of BMI, and found that h&lt;span&gt;igher PGS scores were associated with greater adult weight gain. The accuracy of the PGS at predicting BMI variation depended on age and ancestry.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;PGS scores at the age of 5 explained 35 percent of the BMI variation at age 18. For middle-aged Europeans, it accounted for 17.6 percent of the variation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other groups it was much lower: just 2.2 percent for rural Ugandans, for example. This is probably down to underrepresentation in the training data, and the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-with-an-african-ancestry-also-have-a-few-neanderthal-genes-after-all"&gt;greater genetic diversity&lt;/a&gt; in African populations, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170426" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170426" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BMIPredictor.jpg" alt="BMI predictor" class="wp-image-170426 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BMIPredictor.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BMIPredictor-636x415.jpg 636w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BMIPredictor-600x392.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170426" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The test prediction scores in different populations (top row), and comparison with a current PGS (bottom row, new test in blue). (Smit et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another interesting finding from the study: those with stronger genetic predisposition towards having a higher BMI actually lost more weight during the first year of weight loss programs, although they were also more likely to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-probably-won-t-lose-weight-on-a-reverse-diet-but-it-might-help-you-feel-better"&gt;regain weight later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings emphasize that individuals with a high genetic predisposition to obesity may respond more to lifestyle changes and, thus, contrast with the determinist view that genetic predisposition is unmodifiable," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03827-z"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thinking is that if BMI can be predicted more accurately at an early age, that gives those kids and their parents a bigger window of time to instill healthier habits regarding diet or activity levels, which have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-six-exercises-can-keep-weight-down-even-with-genetic-tendencies-for-obesity"&gt;the potential to influence BMI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This new polygenic score is a dramatic improvement in predictive power and a leap forward in the genetic prediction of obesity risk, which brings us much closer to clinically useful genetic testing," &lt;a href="https://cbmr.ku.dk/news/2025/genetic-test-predicts-obesity-in-childhood/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; geneticist Ruth Loos, from the University of Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03827-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Fertility cycle&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study by &lt;a href="https://www.unm.edu/~gfmiller/cycle_effects_on_tips.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the amount of tips lap dancers receive is directly tied to their fertility cycle. Compared to a menstruating lap dancer, who made on average $35 an hour, women who were ovulating made $70 per hour. Researchers speculate that men may respond to subtle changes in body odor, lip color, pupil dilation, and skin tone that can occur due to &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/2016298663/what-happens-when-you-ovulate"&gt;hormone changes during ovulation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for non-lap dancers? If you want to meet a man: "Men are programmed to seek out women who are more fertile," says Trees. "Always make sure to schedule dates around ovulation if you can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Body odor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-08/factors-make-someone-intesely-attracted-odor.png" alt="Person attracted to other person's odor" title="Factors make someone intensely attracted odor" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;View Apart via Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Smell is a way to determine genetic compatibility," says Trees. Because modern society emphasizes good hygiene, bodily smells that were once used to detect genetic compatibility are masked. What's worse, "birth control appears to reverse a woman's usual smell preferences," says Trees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When a woman is on the Pill, she tends to choose men who smell similar to her father or brother." Women who take birth control may be more apt to choose someone with a similar genetic profile, even though a man with a different genetic profile would be better for her offspring, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/health/surprising-way-body-odor-predicts-who-youll-get-along-with"&gt;The Surprising Way Body Odor Predicts Who You'll Get Along With&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Height&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short men are at a disadvantage when it comes to the dating game. "Height is valued in the marketplace, and tall men do make more on average," says Trees, which doesn't bode well for a shorter man's dating possibilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study of more than 20,000 online daters by the University of Chicago and Dan Ariely of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a man who is five feet tall would need to make $325,000 more than a six-foot-tall man to be as successful in the online dating market. A 5'4" man would need to make $229,000 more, while an average-sized man of 5'6" would need to take in $183,000 more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Adrenaline&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time you plan a date, you may want to do something a bit more adventurous than dinner and a movie. A study performed b&lt;a href="https://sanlab.psych.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/03/Dutton-Aron-1974-arousal.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;y social psychologist Arthur Aron&lt;/a&gt; found that adrenaline can enhance feelings of attraction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trees describe Aron's study in his book. An attractive woman waited for men to cross Vancouver's Capilano Canyon Suspension Bridge, which was constructed with wooden boards and cables that tilt and sway in the wind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a man crossed the precarious bridge, the woman would walk up to him, explain she was conducting a study about attractive scenery, and give him her name and number. Compared to results from a control group that operated nearby on a safer bridge, men who crossed the Capilano were eight times more likely to call the woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/strange-moment-turned-midlife-into-adventure-not-crisis"&gt;The Strange Moment That Turned My Midlife Into An Adventure, Not A Crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Facial symmetry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your left side mirrors your right side, you have a better chance of scoring a date, says Trees. "If you take a face and compare it to a composite face, the composite is always judged as more attractive," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason? The more faces you use to make one composite face, the more symmetrical it becomes. "As you become more symmetrical, the attractiveness ratings go up," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-94160-015" rel="nofollow"&gt;A report from The American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt; (APA) found that women are more likely to enjoy intimacy when their partners are symmetrical. A possible explanation is that symmetry acts as an indicator of good genetic health, and the more diseases and illnesses someone has, the less symmetrical they tend to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Sense of humor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-08/factors-make-someone-intesely-attracted-humor.png" alt="Couple attracted by humor" title="Factors make someone intensely attracted humor" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Krakenimages.com via Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter is not only the best medicine, but it can also help you score a date. "People use humor as a proxy for intelligence and creativity," says Trees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/pmc/pmc10480874" rel="nofollow"&gt;2015 study,&lt;/a&gt; personality and sense of humor are rated higher than physical appearance when it comes to choosing a date. However, it seems that what men and women mean when they say they're looking for "someone with a sense of humor" differs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women are more apt to want someone who makes them laugh, while men want someone who will laugh at their jokes, according to &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-21361-000" rel="nofollow"&gt;research from the International Society for Humor Studies&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers posit that a woman uses humor as an indicator of intelligence and creativity, while a man uses his wit for seduction. "That's not always the case," says Trees. "But there's something aggressive in humor, and men can get intimidated when women are too funny or sharp-tongued."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/amazing-things-happen-when-you-laugh"&gt;7 Amazing Things That Happen To You And Your Body When You Laugh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Love hormones&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love can make people do strange things, but it can do even stranger things to your brain. &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/experts/the-anatomy-of-love"&gt;Dr. Lucy Brown&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the department of neurology and neuroscience at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-07225-013" rel="nofollow"&gt;found that people's brains &lt;/a&gt;were flooded with dopamine, a neurotransmitter that affects pleasure and motivation, when they were shown photographs of their lovers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, love seems to trigger the same kind of &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/falling-love-like-being-on-this-drug-according-research"&gt;euphoric effects&lt;/a&gt; achieved by certain drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Musical taste&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, music is said to soothe the soul. But did you know rock music can help boost your level of attractiveness? A &lt;a href="https://medienportal.univie.ac.at/media/aktuelle-pressemeldungen/detailansicht/artikel/wenn-musik-maennliche-gesichter-attraktiver-macht/" rel="nofollow"&gt;study by North Adams State College in Massachusetts &lt;/a&gt;found that women judging photographs of men found them to be more physically attractive when they were listening to rock music as opposed to when they were listening to jazz or no music at all. "[Rock music] doesn't strike me as romantic," says Trees. "But that's just one more of the strange foibles of the science of attraction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/always-need-music-brain-trying-tell-something-important"&gt;If You Always Need Music On In The Background, Your Brain May Be Trying To Tell You Something Important&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Hair&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-04250-005" rel="nofollow"&gt;study by the Evolutionary Psychology Research Group&lt;/a&gt;, men rated the physical appearance of long-haired women higher than short-haired women, regardless of their facial attractiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/powerful-abilities-people-naturally-long-hair"&gt;Men described women with long hair&lt;/a&gt; as determined, intelligent, independent, and healthy individuals. But short-haired ladies, don't start growing out your tresses yet.

And if you like a glass of wine with dinner or a cocktail on the weekends, brace yourself: New guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/guidelines/high-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:released Thursday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;released Thursday&lt;/a&gt; suggest you abstain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committees from the heart organizations continuously assess the latest research so they can help medical providers figure out the best approach to &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the first new set of guidelines since 2017. Heart disease has long been the No. 1 killer in the world and blood pressure is one of the most easily modifiable ways to avoid such a death. Keeping your blood pressure in check can also reduce your risk of kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of all adults in the US have higher than normal blood pressure. The goal numbers for adults haven’t changed, according to the guidelines: Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg, elevated blood pressure is 120-129/80 mm Hg. If you are at 130/80 mmHg or higher, according to the new guidelines, your medical provider will want you to make some changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury, which is abbreviated as mm Hg. The measurement has an upper number, or systolic reading, and a lower number, a diastolic reading: Systolic pressure measures the force of blood as it pumps out of the heart into the arteries, and diastolic is the pressure created as the heart rests between beats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure doesn’t have any symptoms typically. But when your blood pressure is high, the force of your blood pushes against the walls of your blood vessels, making your heart less efficient, so both the vessels and heart must work harder. Without treatment, high blood pressure will eventually damage your arteries, raising your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How high blood pressure is treated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new blood pressure guidelines say that if your systolic blood pressure is in the 130 to 139 range, your medical provider should first encourage you to adopt healthy lifestyle changes. After three to six months, if the lifestyle changes alone don’t lower your blood pressure to the goal range, then medication is recommended, the new guidelines say. That’s a shift from 2017 recommendation that anyone with systolic blood pressure above 140 should be prescribed lifestyle changes and medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So just trying to more aggressively control blood pressure, for it to be better for more people, to prevent cardiovascular disease, strokes, kidney disease, and now we know lowering blood pressure actually helps reduce the risk for dementia as well. So that’s really big news out of this guideline,” said Dr. Daniel Jones, American Heart Association chair of the writing committee for the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes, according to the new guidelines, include maintaining or achieving a healthy weight, eating a heart-healthy diet, reducing the amount of salt in what you eat and drink, managing stress, at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and resistance exercise like weight training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s another shift from 2017: The new guidelines also recommend forgoing alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines used to say that if people chose to drink, it should be one drink or less a day for women, and two or less a day for men. Jones said there’s just too much evidence now that alcohol negatively impacts your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people enjoy drinking, but because the evidence is there, we want you to make an informed decision,” said Jones, who is also dean and professor emeritus of the University of Mississippi School of Medicine. “There’s a lot of individual variability with the relationship between alcohol and blood pressure, but we put forward the ideal as abstinence, and for those who choose to drink, less than one for women and less than two for men.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a growing body of evidence, there’s also more emphasis on how important it is to lower blood pressure to reduce the risk of developing dementia, Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more studies about women having trouble with &lt;a href="https://www.goredforwomen.org/en/mom-life/for-moms-with-babies-and-toddlers/expert-advice-about-high-blood-pressure-and-pregnancy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure during pregnancy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;high blood pressure during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, Jones said, the guidelines also newly emphasize how important it is for people who want to become pregnant or those who are pregnant to monitor their blood pressure. High blood pressure can hurt the pregnancy and can raise a person’s risk of having elevated blood pressure even long after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary recommendations still include the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan#:~:text=Description%20of%20the%20DASH%20Eating,sugar%2Dsweetened%20beverages%20and%20sweets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DASH diet &lt;/a&gt;which is a diet high on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils and and low on fat, sugar, and tropical oils like coconut and palm oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also harp on sodium again and we know salt and alcohol are favorites for lots of people, but we do recommend limiting salt intake, increasing potassium intake,” Jones said. One easy way to do that is if cooking at home to use potassium-enriched salt substitutes. Sodium intake should be less than 2,300 mg per day, moving toward a more ideal limit of 1,500 mg per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with overweight or obesity, the guidelines recommend losing at least 5% of body weight. For people with more severe obesity, the guidelines recommend what Jones says are clinically proven interventions: diet and exercise, and weight loss medications &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:including GLP-1s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;including GLP-1s&lt;/a&gt;. For people with very severe obesity, the guidelines also suggest surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones said he knows it can be difficult for people to keep their blood pressure in check, but taking these steps can help a person’s health significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reality is the first line of things we recommend for both prevention and treatment of high blood pressure have to do with eating and we live in a very difficult environment for food. It’s hard for people to have a low sodium intake. It’s hard for people to eat enough potassium. It’s hard for people to take in a small number of calories, but the good news is that all that stuff works if you’re willing to do it,” Jones said. “It’s hard, but it works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For

class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Companies appear reluctant to carry out trials despite the fact that three previous studies all found that the drug shows promise as a way of slowing down the growth of cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mifepristone’s role in medical abortions and fact that access to abortion is restricted in some countries is preventing much-needed research being done, the experts claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/tests-and-treatments/abortion/what-happens/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one of two drugs, alongside misoprostol&lt;/a&gt;, that women in the UK take when ending a pregnancy that began up to 10 weeks earlier. They take a mifepristone tablet, then wait for 24-48 hours and then take the misoprostol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is deeply disappointing that the successful application of mifepristone in one area of clinical medicine is hindering more extensive research into other indications that could benefit public health,” the opinion piece written by eight co-authors and published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Women’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; says. All are experts in reproductive health or reproductive cancer working in London, Edinburgh, Stockholm and Erbil in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The time is long overdue to give mifepristone the opportunity it deserves to be investigated as a non-surgical option for primary prevention [of breast cancer],” they add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Breast cancer is the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/breast-cancer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;most common female cancer in most countries&lt;/a&gt; in the world and kills an estimated 670,000 women globally every year, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Although small-scale, the three previous studies offered evidence mifepristone can limit the effect of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/breast-cancer-in-women/causes-of-breast-cancer-in-women/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the hormone progesterone, which drives the cell growth found in breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;. They were published in 2008, 2022 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mifepristone is a type of drug known as a selective progesterone receptor modulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If proven to work, it could help women who are at high risk of breast cancer, such as those who carry a variant of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Currently they are offered surgical options for their treatment, such as a mastectomy, or drugs that are of “low efficacy”, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;UK cancer charities endorsed the plea for drug companies to look seriously into the role mifepristone could play in breast cancer care and for governments to enable that to happen by easing regulations that restrict its use to abortion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Simon Vincent, the chief scientific officer at Breast &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Now, said: “More risk-reducing treatment options for women with a high risk of developing breast cancer, that also protects their quality of life, are desperately needed. And we need to explore all avenues, including existing drugs, to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“So early research into mifepristone is an important step forward and we need further studies to understand if these drugs are safe and effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Marianne Baker, Cancer Research UK’s science engagement manager, said the 57,900 new diagnoses a year of breast cancer in Britain showed that “it’s vital we invest in research exploring new ways to prevent the disease”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She added: “Cancer develops when cells grow uncontrollably. Early studies showed that mifepristone slowed down cell growth in breast tissue, so it might be useful in delaying or preventing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“But we need more research to understand whether it’s effective, how it works and who would benefit most from it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Kristina Gemzell Danielsson, the piece’s lead author, and who heads the department of women’s and children’s health at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said: “Stigma around mifepristone used for abortion is describing part of why mifepristone is not more extensively researched for prevention of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Taken together, our data support the use of mifepristone for prevention of poor prognosis breast cancer. All studies were randomised controlled trials using a low dose of mifepristone for two or three months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 01:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxNbV9yQ2tXMEtKUVpNLUd5UHRXX1VVX0NMcEdiWUp4SU5CSzBBbHY1R2l6NW5lU0FNQ01rVGdVV2VQY1FqYWVtNXNya21LNnBmWHdwZ3lwOUxpdDQ3N2l0eU5rOV83RktFQkdBVHdFU0I3Y19kT21ySXo4aF9GbjlRMTlDZWRqUzZ2LXlSUXhuazhSZ3lSOU1UYnlmNVRnLUpYZEZPQ3FpWXQ2RzV1UkdNVVR4dXc0MnRrZlJfVGFvZw</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，这种蔬菜可以延长您的寿命- EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE9Cc2ZKeTZ5aHFWM3ZEdmhFMkhzR2JNeWREWFpwWVFudnQtVUpFM1JWRlhocUI4Tk5fZDNKby1pXzcyRjlIRFRJWExaWUFKeENIYzl4ZFN3NkpaczJNMFp6bTRJYVM5YmtZeC0wMmhqUHlSUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You probably know you should eat your veggies, but did you know they can add years to your life? Research shows that eating plenty of fruits and vegetables can help you live longer by preventing or delaying the onset of chronic diseases like heart disease or certain cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While all vegetables are great for you, one stands out for its potential longevity benefits—and it’s one that you probably already have in your fridge. That superstar is spinach, a nutrient-packed leafy green worth adding to your plate. Here’s why dietitians recommend eating more spinach to add years to your life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-spinach-is-a-longevity-star"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Spinach Is a Longevity Star &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Rich in Antioxidants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
If you want to live a longer and healthier life, keeping inflammation in check is a top priority. Fortunately, antioxidant-rich foods like spinach can help with this. According to &lt;a href="https://wellrootedhn.com/about-us/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Umo Callins, M.S., RD, CSSD, LD, CPT&lt;/a&gt;, spinach is rich in vitamin C and carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin, all of which help to fight free radicals and reduce inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Lower Your Chronic Disease Risk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Helping to delay or prevent chronic disease is a good reason to eat more spinach. Regularly eating spinach and other dark leafy greens is linked to a lower risk of many chronic conditions. For example, eating spinach may benefit heart health. “Spinach is high in nitrates, which have been shown to help blood pressure levels,” says &lt;a href="https://thebalancednutritionist.com/about-jamie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jamie Nadeau, RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She adds that spinach may also reduce the risk of certain types of cancer thanks to its cancer-fighting compounds, including beta carotene, vitamin C, flavonols and other phytochemicals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Supports Your Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;A growing body of research suggests that your gut health is an important predictor of longevity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One way to show your gut some love is to regularly eat more leafy greens like spinach, which contains fiber to support healthy digestion. For the most benefit, eat it cooked—one cup of cooked spinach has over four grams of fiber compared with less than one gram in the same amount of raw spinach.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s not where the gut benefits end, either. Spinach is also rich in carotenoids like beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin, which research has linked with greater diversity in the gut microbiome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Protect Your Brain As You Age &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Your brain’s biological age is one of the strongest predictors of longevity,” says &lt;a href="https://maggiemoon.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Maggie Moon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s why reaching for spinach more often is a no-brainer for supporting your brain health. Moon adds that spinach is a longevity star since it’s high in folate, antioxidants and other phytochemicals that help with age-related cognitive decline. In fact, one study found that a high intake of green leafy vegetables such as spinach was associated with better cognitive function and slower cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-add-spinach-to-your-diet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Add Spinach to Your Diet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To score the most longevity benefits, you’ll want to add dark leafy greens like spinach to your plate a few times a week. The good news? Spinach is a versatile ingredient, making it easy to incorporate into meals. Here are a few of our favorite ways to add more spinach to your diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sautéed&lt;/strong&gt;. One of the simplest ways to prepare spinach is to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252947/simple-sauteed-spinach/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sauté it in a skillet&lt;/a&gt; with some garlic until it wilts. Moon likes to add a quick-cooking protein like eggs or shrimp to her sautéed spinach for a fast and versatile meal. For a well-rounded meal, try adding some complex carbs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blend into Smoothies&lt;/strong&gt;. Adding a handful of spinach to your morning smoothie can help you reach your daily vegetable goals while also supporting longevity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use as a Salad Green&lt;/strong&gt;. Fresh spinach makes a great base for salad. Since it has a subtle flavor, it pairs well with many different toppings. To maximize iron absorption from spinach, add vitamin C-rich foods to your salad, like bell peppers or citrus fruits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Color to Sandwiches or Wraps&lt;/strong&gt;. Fresh baby spinach makes a great addition to your favorite sandwich or wrap to add color and nutrition, says Nadeau.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try Frozen Spinach&lt;/strong&gt;. If you struggle to use up a whole package of fresh spinach before it gets slimy, try stocking up on frozen spinach instead. It still offers just as much nutritional value as fresh and can be easily incorporated into a variety of cooked dishes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-veggies-that-promote-longevity"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Veggies that Promote Longevity &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re not a fan of spinach or just want to mix things up, there are plenty of other vegetables that can promote longevity. “All leafy green vegetables, from arugula to romaine, are longevity heroes”, says Moon. Beyond greens, Callins notes that red and purple vegetables like cabbage and beets are also excellent additions to your diet. “They are rich in betalains and anthocyanins, which are natural pigments that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that support cardiovascular health, metabolic health and brain function”.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to choosing vegetables for longevity, variety is key. Moon suggests aiming for at least five to nine different vegetables each week to ensure you get a wide range of longevity-supporting nutrients. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regularly eating more vegetables is a small, sustainable habit that not only supports your day-to-day well-being, but it may also add years to your life. Vegetables are packed with nutrients your body needs to combat inflammation, oxidative stress and support chronic disease prevention. Spinach is one standout veggie thanks to its nutrient-rich profile and versatility—its mild flavor makes it easy to add to dishes like smoothies, soups and stir-fries. Fresh or frozen, it’s time to stock up!&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet and others like it have been extensively linked to reducing the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mediterranean-diet-could-protect-against-a-common-form-of-liver-disease"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/12-year-study-reveals-how-the-mediterranean-diet-might-affect-your-brain"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-mediterranean-lifestyle-really-can-help-you-live-longer-study-shows"&gt;premature death&lt;/a&gt;. Now a new study provides more evidence that this choice of foods can protect against dementia – as well as giving us some clues as to why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from Rush University Medical Center in Chicago wanted to look specifically at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIND_diet"&gt;the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet&lt;/a&gt;, which combines elements of the Mediterranean diet with the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's a lot of acronyms, but it essentially means lots of vegetables, whole grains, fish, and poultry, and not so much dairy, red meat, and fried food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ask-yourself-these-4-questions-before-you-start-a-new-diet"&gt;Ask Yourself These 4 Questions Before You Start a New Diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers investigated links between this balance of food items and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampal_sclerosis"&gt;hippocampal sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; – a condition linked to dementia and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170804" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, where neurons die off in the brain's hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the postmortem brains of 809 people for whom diet information had been logged for several years before their death, the study found that those who stuck closest to the MIND diet were less likely to show signs of hippocampal sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest that consuming a healthy diet, such as the MIND diet, may decrease the likelihood of hippocampal sclerosis and may support hippocampal health," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.26089"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170808" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170808" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainScan-1.jpg" alt="Brain scan" class="wp-image-170808 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainScan-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainScan-1-600x362.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170808" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers connected certain types of brain damage to diet choices.

This latest study offers fresh insight into a significant part of the reason why that link is there: the foods in the MIND diet appear to protect the hippocampus in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucial to remembering, learning, and navigating, damage to the hippocampus is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-one-isolated-brain-change-may-signal-alzheimers-study-finds"&gt;closely tied to dementia&lt;/a&gt;. While not everyone with hippocampal sclerosis has dementia, or vice versa, there's a significant overlap between the two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research accounted for a variety of demographic and genetic factors, but isn't enough to prove direct cause and effect. What it does show, together with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-say-this-one-particular-diet-may-slow-the-decline-of-the-brain"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt;, is a strong probability that dementia risk is to some extent affected by what we eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To our knowledge these are the first findings in human studies to report that the association of diet and dementia is partially mediated by hippocampal sclerosis," nutrition epidemiologist Puja Agarwal told Hannah Millington at &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/alzheimers-dementia-mind-diet-food-disease-prevention-2110316"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear how hippocampal sclerosis gets started, but scientists are continuing to discover more about it, and its connections to dementia. It's not the first time it's been shown that the health of this part of the brain could be &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2024.03.015"&gt;affected by diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies may endeavor to understand why this link exists. It's possible that the anti-inflammatory and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant"&gt;antioxidant effects&lt;/a&gt; of the foods in the MIND diet are helping to guard the brain's neurons from damage in some way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To further understand the mechanisms linking diet and nutrients with the overall brain health, investigating diet's relationship with other biomarkers of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the brain will be critical," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.26089"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.26089"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

No gym membership required. Just a pair of shoes and a willingness to alternate between brisk and slow-paced walking in three-minute bursts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubbed “Japanese walking,” the latest viral fitness trend is &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/japanese-walking?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;all over TikTok&lt;/a&gt; and has people wondering whether this short-interval workout can improve health more efficiently than a traditional stroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend has spread across social media and beyond, with bloggers, online articles and major media outlets all jumping in on the walking routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocol traces back to a&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025619611613037" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; 2007 Japanese study&lt;/a&gt; that tested the effects of high-intensity interval walking on middle-aged and older adults. But the recent buzz started with a punchy video from Australian content creator and fitness coach Eugene Teo that surpassed 10 million views on TikTok and 17 million views on YouTube. Known to his over 426,000 TikTok followers and 1.22 million YouTube followers as “Coach Eugene,” Teo rebranded the science-backed routine into an accessible, algorithm-friendly idea: “Japanese walking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People don’t like fitness jargon,” Teo, 33, said in a recent interview with The Times. “They don’t like scientific terms … and if I want to impact millions globally … I like to make fitness advice and scientific jargon a lot more accessible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his video explainer, Teo describes the method: Walk fast for three minutes, slow down for three minutes and repeat the cycle five times.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;div id="breaking-news-signup-form" class="email-form rounded my-3 px-4 py-3"&gt;
                &lt;div class="row"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-2 mb-md-0 text-center text-md-start"&gt;
                        &lt;h6 class="fs-4 mt-0 mb-1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't miss out on what's happening!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the small study of 186 women and 60 men, participants who followed this routine four or more days a week saw greater improvements in blood pressure, leg strength and aerobic capacity than those in the moderate-intensity continuous walking group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s that cardio work that a lot of people are missing,” Teo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teo, a longtime coach and nutritionist, didn’t invent the protocol, but he did help it reach millions. He said his viral video resonated with people overwhelmed by the pressure to hit 10,000 steps a day — a goal Teo himself often finds out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s been following this protocol on and off for years, ever since he came across the study. Usually, he does his walking on a treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people have this all-or-nothing approach where they think, ‘Oh, I can’t hit 10,000 steps. I’ve failed,’” he said. “It’s about just changing the stigma people have and that all-or-nothing mentality … of what fitness should be about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He emphasizes effort over perfection: Walk fast enough to get out of breath, but not so fast that you can’t finish the three-minute interval. The recovery periods are as slow as needed to reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is the science behind the trend as strong as the messaging?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Helga Van Herle, a cardiologist with Keck Medicine of USC, noted flaws in the original study’s design — namely, that only the high-intensity walking group was monitored with accelerometers, not the moderate intensity group, a bias that could have skewed results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This creates a major bias in the monitoring and compliance and could potentially skew the results in favor of the high-intensity training group,” she said in an email, pointing to &lt;a href="https://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/hawthorne/09.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Hawthorne effect&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenon in which people alter their behavior because they know they’re being watched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Parveen Garg, also with Keck Medicine of USC, said he doesn’t see intense interval walking as a standout recommendation among physicians. The study, he said, was small and meant to be thought-provoking and encourage further research, not to support sweeping conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He supports any activity that gets people moving but cautions against over-hyping Japanese walking benefits or ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s kind of onerous,” he said, explaining that remembering to switch gears every three minutes, walking fast and slow and navigating technology isn’t easy for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said it’s possible to get similar benefits by walking continuously at a vigorous pace for a shorter time. But there isn’t enough evidence to confirm that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts agree that vigorous activity, even in short spurts, is beneficial. David Raichlen, professor of biological sciences and anthropology at USC, said short intervals of increased effort — even just walking briskly for a few minutes — can yield meaningful health effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s something to the idea that small amounts of vigorous activity are really beneficial,” Raichlen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raichlen also noted that calling high-intensity interval walking “Japanese walking” simply because of the study’s origin is problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yasuyuki Suzuki, a cardiac imaging specialist from Tokyo, is aware of the trend and the associated study. He said that while there is some new interest in the topic, it is not trending in Japan the way it appears to be in other parts of the world. He also said he does not feel any discomfort or concern about it being referred to as “Japanese walking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for whether this method is better than 10,000 steps or continuous walking, Raichlen is hesitant to say — the research just isn’t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher walking cadence has been linked to lower dementia risk, Raichlen said. Also, walking in general has been tied to lower mortality, reduced cancer risk and improved cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do think there’s a lot of good from encouraging people to think about walking as exercise,” Raichlen said. “Finding ways to sort of make walking work better for you is, you know, not a bad thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the simplicity and catchy name may be why it took off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pretty much anybody in Los Angeles can go outside and walk around,” said Sarah T. Roberts, a UCLA associate professor and internet culture expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberts sees the trend as a reflection of broader social forces, including medical mistrust and the rising cost of health care and fitness. “We’re in a moment of economic uncertainty,” she said. “For most people, a $300-a-month membership at Equinox is not a reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, she said, makes low-barrier trends like “Japanese walking” especially appealing. But Roberts cautioned against the risks of turning to TikTok and other social media platforms for medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stuff doesn’t happen in a vacuum,” she said. “There’s a bigger social and political context to all of these things, and the backdrop to these kinds of trends is not great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberts encourages viewers to critically evaluate where their health advice comes from and who profits from it. “People with big followings often have something to sell,” she said. “They’re not really acting in the public interest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Roberts said, with every health trend, social media companies are profiting. Although some platforms have tried to crack down on medical misinformation, Roberts said such content moderation has fallen out of favor because it affects revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Devaluing expertise means devaluing the collective knowledge that people have in certain domains,” Roberts said. “If I try to fix my own car, my car is probably not going to run very well. Now apply that to my body.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teo said fitness trends should be approached with discernment. He’s not claiming to replace traditional walking — just to offer a stepping stone for cardio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if a viral name is what it takes to get people walking, he’s OK with that. “As long as you’re not misleading people,” he said, “and there’s legitimate substance behind it, it’s a great way to spin things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teo, Raichlen, Garg and Roberts all agree on one thing: Talk to your doctor before starting any new exercise routine, especially one that reaches vigorous intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

His wounds healed quicker, and his skin was less red and inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His skin was also less itchy, which also reduced his scratching. His sleep was also less disturbed as he didn’t need to have his special wound dressings changed as often, so this was a great benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Cekaviciene said the trial has given her son more freedom than before, but he still needs to be careful in any activity to avoid falling over or being bumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabrielius was referred to GOSH as a baby after medics spotted a wound when he was born, and he was diagnosed with RDEB when he was two weeks old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, the condition can lead to severe complications and many patients with the condition develop a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma when they are young adults – this is the most common cause of death for RDEB patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 hMfEaO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/14/10/53/01K2KJH2PQS1FCDSBC7S1RA06J.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/14/10/53/01K2KJH2PQS1FCDSBC7S1RA06J.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/14/10/53/01K2KJH2PQS1FCDSBC7S1RA06J.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Gabrielius is one of 30 children who took part in the new clinical trial at GOSH and Birmingham Children’s Hospital, in which he received certain stem cells via an intravenous drip" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-54867"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Gabrielius is one of 30 children who took part in the new clinical trial at GOSH and Birmingham Children’s Hospital, in which he received certain stem cells via an intravenous drip&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Family handout/PA Wire)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Cekaviciene said: “The first two years were really hard as you had to watch him constantly – even rubbing his eyes could cause painful blistering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He couldn’t even tell us how much pain he was in or where he was hurting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabrielius is one of 30 children who took part in the new clinical trial at GOSH and Birmingham Children’s Hospital, in which he received certain stem cells via an intravenous drip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the trial, medics assessed whether regular infusions with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) improved symptoms for children with the condition, after studies suggested that this treatment could promote wound healing, reduce inflammation and stimulate tissue regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients would go into hospital and have a drip which delivers the cells over 10 to 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the trial, funded by NHS England, the National Institute for Health and Care Research and the charity Cure EB, children were given a treatment called CORDStrom, manufactured by INmuneBio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INmuneBio has agreed to provide CORDStrom free of charge for a year for all children who took part in the trial, so researchers can continue to study them, and patients are expected to get two infusions of the treatment every four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is seeking regulatory approval for the treatment so it can be approved for use in the UK and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 23:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxQaUN4eUdsaXJ5SXp1YkU1MjkxTG5sRUtEV0V0ekxIeHZrYnF1a0o5Nk9jQTg4TmpsZ19nR0pheVU3X1JGWUg1OVFRQVR0b1BqRWF1RDF3T2ZzaXFRUVc0VzFmekN4REQ4TEJjcEtVbE1fb0xoTHluY1pjLXFLc2pDSjBmWl9kNEZlYU5JYkstaF9MdEpCUDFlcUoyX3dob2hYWi1YemdBdUpJeWZSS0RNT0cxQWV2aVlMS2FfTE9ZX2I</guid></item><item><title>未来阿尔茨海默氏症的信号可能隐藏在你说话的方式中- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPRkR5UVktbV9XUU1qWnY5Wk8zaWwtV1VyWklZY3EtWVJXLXFIZEVFV0xydlQtRVNaXzJLX2NhSWRiZmFsOFhvX1Y4RGVCVk5MV3pBOFRWUU1GNTZ6R2tLOVp4aFB1ZHhyU19YdV9reGxfRVdnbGh0LWFBYWJvOHB0QnpQRVdVdGtLSmF2dGhVcXZxSlZr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We're still not sure exactly what causes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, but we know what its effects look like, and we're getting better at detecting the early signs of it – including, perhaps, those in our speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from Boston University have developed a new AI ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73092" data-postid="170777" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/Types-of-AI-algorithms-and-how-they-work"&gt;algorithm&lt;/a&gt; that analyzes the speech patterns of those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6O1cNKoCPw"&gt;predict a progression&lt;/a&gt; from MCI to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170777" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; within six years with an accuracy of 78.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-early-speech-related-signs-youre-at-risk-of-alzheimers-disease"&gt;5 Early, Speech-Related Signs You're at Risk of Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team's study, published in 2024, continues their &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.064029"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt;, where they trained a model – using voice recordings from over 1,000 individuals – to accurately detect cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their new algorithm was trained on transcribed audio recordings of 166 individuals with MCI, aged 63–97.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the team already knew who had developed Alzheimer's, a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning"&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; approach could be used to find signs in &lt;span&gt;their transcribed speech&lt;/span&gt; that linked the 90 people whose cognitive function would decline into Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once trained, the algorithm could then be applied in reverse: to try and predict Alzheimer's risk from transcripts of speech samples it had never processed before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other important factors, including age and self-reported sex, were added to produce a final predictive score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145445" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/YearsToAlzheimersFromMCI.jpg" alt="A graph with blue columns " class="size-full wp-image-145445" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/YearsToAlzheimersFromMCI.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/YearsToAlzheimersFromMCI-603x415.jpg 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/YearsToAlzheimersFromMCI-600x413.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145445" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Number of MCI patients transitioning to Alzheimer's disease (AD) annually over six years.

It shows the power of AI."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering there's currently no cure for Alzheimer's, you might wonder what the benefit of detecting it early is – but we do have treatments that &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/treatments"&gt;can help manage Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; to some extent, and these can be started earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, early detection gives us more opportunity to study the disease and its progression, and from there develop a fully effective treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those known to be likely to develop Alzheimer's can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-alzheimers-trial-shows-new-drug-can-slow-disease-progression"&gt;participate in clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145446" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145446" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/PredictingAlzheimersFromSpeech.jpg" alt="Gaphic of the automated pipeline for Alzheimer's disease prediction from a neuropsychological test interview." class="size-full wp-image-145446" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/PredictingAlzheimersFromSpeech.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/PredictingAlzheimersFromSpeech-600x245.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145446" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The prediction process.

It's the sort of test that could be done quickly and inexpensively, even at home, and without any specialist equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't need any injections or samples, just a recording, and it could even be run through a smartphone app in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you can predict what will happen, you have more of an opportunity and time window to intervene with drugs, and at least try to maintain the stability of the condition and prevent the transition to more severe forms of dementia," Paschalidis &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/new-ai-program-could-predict-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recordings used here were rather rough and of low quality.
