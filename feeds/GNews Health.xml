    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BERLIN — Decongestant nasal sprays can save you from a restless night when a cold clogs up your nose, but pharmacists warn this aid can be a slippery slope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leaflet that comes with it will – if you read it – tell you that a decongestant spray should not be used for longer than seven days in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmacist Alexander Schmitz advises even more caution. He said anyone with a blocked nose should give it up after four to five days and use a moisturizing seawater-based spray instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason is that the nasal mucosa quickly adapts to decongestant active ingredients, which cause the blood vessels in the lining to constrict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point you can’t breathe without the spray, so you have to make sure you always have it with you,” says Schmitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pharmacist said he repeatedly encounters people who have developed a nasal spray dependency. Coming off it can be hard, he says. “After all, everyone wants to be able to breathe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a nasal spray after your cold has gone also has other unwanted effects. Over time, decongestant sprays dry out the nasal mucosa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This not only risks bleeding, but also greater susceptibility to infection, because pathogens can penetrate more easily,” Schmitz explains. Important protective functions of the nose then work only to a limited extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to wean the nasal lining off decongestant sprays? The classic tip is to switch first to a children’s version, which contains less active ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the nose has adjusted to the lower dose, the next step is to switch to a seawater nasal spray that contains no active ingredient at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This plan does not always work. “Many have had this adaptation for years. Then those are steps that are too big,” said Schmitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that case he advised seeking help at a pharmacy. “We can dilute the nasal spray. Then you wean yourself off in really tiny steps until you eventually reach 0.0%, that is the seawater nasal spray.” How long this takes depends on the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike with decongestant sprays, seawater sprays don’t bring the risk of the nasal lining becoming dependent, since these simply have a moisturizing effect.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The secret to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/something-in-your-hair-could-make-the-ultimate-toothpaste"&gt;preventing tooth decay&lt;/a&gt; may have been hiding in your mouth all along. Increasing levels of an amino acid in saliva can turn bacterial biofilms from damaging to protective, a clinical study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar doesn't directly harm your teeth – but it &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microbiologists-explain-what-happens-in-your-mouth-when-you-eat-sugar"&gt;attracts and feeds bacteria&lt;/a&gt; that do. These bugs excrete acidic substances that then get to work dissolving tooth enamel. The issue is worsened by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microbes-can-form-superorganisms-that-crawl-across-our-teeth"&gt;bacterial biofilms&lt;/a&gt; that form on tooth surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the recent study from researchers at Aarhus University in Denmark has found a way to switch the balance of power among mouth microbes back in our favor. The key is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"&gt;arginine&lt;/a&gt;, an amino acid that's naturally found in saliva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/silencing-bacterial-chatter-in-your-mouth-may-help-prevent-tooth-decay"&gt;Silencing Bacterial 'Chatter' in Your Mouth May Help Prevent Tooth Decay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people with active tooth decay, regular arginine treatment significantly reduced the acidity of bacterial biofilms, by changing the ratios of sugars and bacteria populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results revealed differences in acidity of the biofilms, with the ones treated with arginine being significantly more protected against acidification caused by sugar metabolism," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260108231335.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Yumi Del Rey, microbiologist at Aarhus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10005-2693"&gt;Plenty of previous research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested arginine plays a role in keeping tooth decay at bay, but most studies have been conducted in lab experiments. The Aarhus University study was designed to test whether the same effects occur in real-world environments of human mouths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188581" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188581" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-642x192.jpeg" alt="A Secret Ingredient For Preventing Tooth Decay Might Be in Your Mouth Already" class="wp-image-188581 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-642x192.jpeg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-1200x360.jpeg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-768x230.jpeg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-1536x460.jpeg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay-600x180.jpeg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/arginine-tooth-decay.jpeg 1898w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188581" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A diagram illustrating the dentures designed to grow biofilms and how they were treated. (Del Rey et al., &lt;em&gt;Int. J. Oral Sci.&lt;/em&gt; 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten participants wore dentures over their lower teeth for four days, which had tiny panels on either side that allowed biofilms to form. Three times a day, the dentures were removed for treatment in a dipping device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the biofilm panels were bathed in a solution containing 10 percent sucrose. Then, one side was treated with an arginine solution while the other was dunked in plain old distilled water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After four days, the dentures were removed and the biofilms examined in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The aim was to investigate the impact of arginine treatment on the acidity, type of bacteria, and the carbohydrate matrix of biofilms from patients with active caries," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260108231335.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sebastian Schlafer, microbiologist at Aarhus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the biofilms were exposed to sugar again, those treated with arginine consistently showed higher pH levels. If you remember your high school chemistry days, a higher pH means lower acidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the team investigated how arginine might be reducing acidity, by taking stock of which bacteria and sugars were present in each sample. Biofilms treated with arginine showed lower levels of a sugar called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucose"&gt;fucose&lt;/a&gt;, while another sugar, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactose"&gt;galactose&lt;/a&gt;, was concentrated towards the outer surface of the biofilm – in other words, away from the tooth surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the DNA of bacteria present, the researchers found that arginine treatment significantly reduced a specific population of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bacteria that produce acid, while slightly increasing other bacterial strains that can metabolize arginine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, results seemed to vary from person to person. Some participants didn't respond to treatment, and the researchers were unable to link this variability to clear differences in populations of microbes or sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More work will need to be done to investigate how arginine affects biofilms, but the amino acid could be a promising new addition to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-newly-discovered-bacteria-can-help-prevent-cavities-and-scientists-want-to-put-them-in-a-pill"&gt;oral hygiene products&lt;/a&gt; like toothpaste or mouthwash. And it's already considered safe – not only is arginine naturally present, but it's also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/supplement-for-high-blood-pressure-clears-signs-of-alzheimers-in-mice"&gt;used to treat conditions&lt;/a&gt; like high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41368-025-00404-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The International Journal of Oral Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In the mid-1990s, the rate was 63%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-92f642" class="body-graf"&gt;The 70% figure is based on diagnoses from 2015 to 2021. The findings were published Tuesday in the American Cancer Society’s medical journal, CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6b3fae" class="body-graf"&gt;Five years is the most common benchmark for measuring cancer survival, since the risk of certain cancers’ recurring declines significantly if the cancers haven’t come back within that time.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a09bc" class="body-graf"&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-patients-immunotherapy-may-way-skip-surgery-chemo-rcna203038" target="_blank"&gt;improved treatment options&lt;/a&gt; over the last decade, many cancers have gone from death sentences to chronic diseases, according to the report’s lead author, Rebecca Siegel, the American Cancer Society’s senior scientific director of surveillance research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a649fa" class="body-graf"&gt;“It takes decades for research to understand and develop these more effective treatments, and now we’re seeing the fruits of those investments,” Siegel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7cd0ff" class="body-graf"&gt;The report estimates that 4.8 million cancer deaths were prevented from 1991 to 2023, largely because of better treatments, earlier detection methods and reductions in smoking.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-86dfd3" class="body-graf"&gt;Siegel said scientists have a greater understanding of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/fat-cells-breast-cancer-tumors-triple-negative-risk-overweight-rcna225598" target="_blank"&gt;how cancer develops and spreads&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to engineer the immune system to stop or slow cancer growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d185f9" class="body-graf"&gt;She highlighted immunotherapies as one of the biggest advances — the treatments help the immune system find and attack cancer cells. Immunotherapy has been “game changing” for myeloma, Siegel said. The five-year survival rate for the blood cancer, which is twice as common among Black people as in white people in the U.S., rose to 62% from 32% in the mid-1990s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-475727" class="body-graf"&gt;Targeted therapy, which targets specific genes or proteins that help cancer cells grow, has been &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cancer-fighting-antibodies-inject-chemo-directly-tumor-cells-upping-ef-rcna153773" target="_blank"&gt;another major advancement&lt;/a&gt;, as such treatments cause less damage to healthy cells and come with fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3f51dc" class="body-graf"&gt;“Staying on treatment longer allows patients to live longer, and these less toxic treatments allow more sequences of therapy,” said Dr. Christopher Flowers, head of cancer medicine at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who wasn’t involved in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6c3e2c" class="body-graf"&gt;Flowers said targeted therapies and immunotherapies have improved survival outcomes for lung cancer, which kills more people than any other cancer in the U.S. The five-year survival rate for regional lung cancer — which is found in the lung and nearby structures or lymph nodes — is now 37%, up from 20% in the mid-1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-73f5d7" class="body-graf"&gt;However, further progress could be made by &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/ultra-processed-foods-linked-increased-risk-precancerous-polyps-study-rcna243574" target="_blank"&gt;addressing major risk factors for cancer&lt;/a&gt;, said Dr. Clark Gamblin, a gastrointestinal surgeon at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and chief of surgical oncology at the University of Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-043a73" class="body-graf"&gt;“Our country has an epidemic of obesity, and cancers follow that,” said Gamblin, who wasn’t involved in the report. “So we’re not winning on every front.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0edb7c" class="body-graf"&gt;Colorectal cancer rates are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-rates-rising-young-people-deaths-diagnosis-rcna233805" target="_blank"&gt;rising in people under age 50&lt;/a&gt;, and overall breast cancer rates are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-cases-increasing-women-declining-men-report-rcna187586" target="_blank"&gt;rising among women&lt;/a&gt;.

While this marks a large decrease, it does not mean the flu has peaked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What the CDC is saying is that people weren’t seeking care during the holidays,” Teichman explained. This is likely the reason behind the drop in cases, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people were sick with the flu but not getting tested, flu rates would appear lower — even if they’re not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sood added that folks who already had time off from work for the holidays may have decided to get better at home and not seek testing or treatment. So, if folks were off the week between Christmas and New Year’s, flu rates through early January may appear lower than they actually are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not really clear if the cases are going down because the actual incidence of infection is going down, which I hope is the case, or if it’s just backlog or less people seeking care and testing during the holidays and right after the holidays,” Sood added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s good to see that cases may be starting to tail off, but I would caution people that it’s still early days ... we would want to see a continuing trend, a downward trend, before we let down our guard,” said &lt;a href="https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/1636/daniel-kuritzkes-infectious_disease-boston" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Daniel R.

We are not at peak yet ... most commonly we peak in February, but we’ll see,” Teichman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rough flu season is likely being caused by “a slight mismatch” between the prevalent circulating flu strain and the flu shot, according to Kuritzkes. This is because a new flu strain emerged after the flu shot formulation was decided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flu hospitalizations and deaths are up throughout the country.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitalizations and deaths from the flu are up from the prior week, according to the most recent CDC data. Experts say this makes sense after the particularly high surge in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We always say that hospitalization and mortality are lagging indicators because people have to have caught the flu and then progressed to the point where they’re sick enough to be hospitalized,” Kuritzkes noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt; If you are not feeling well, stay home.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to avoid getting the flu? Here’s what you can do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People should still be continuing to take all the precautions that they ordinarily would, in terms of careful attention to washing your hands when you come in from being out and about, wearing a mask if you’re in crowded indoor circumstances, staying away from people who are coughing and sneezing,” Kuritzkes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try also to avoid contact with high-touch surfaces, Teichman suggested. For instance, if you’re out and about, use your sleeve to open doors or press elevator buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not feeling well, stay home. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/early-symptoms-flu_l_695e6cb5e4b05bed6f971f03" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Common flu symptoms" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696118bde4b0120ab25d1957" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="695e6cb5e4b05bed6f971f03" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;Common flu symptoms&lt;/a&gt; include fever, body aches, headaches and a sore throat.

              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      Olive oil contains heart-healthy fats.
                      
              &lt;span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name="image-source" itemprop="creditText"&gt;

              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Landry's first swap relates to the type of fat used for cooking. He suggests switching butter or lard for heart-healthy fats like olive oil or avocado oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not necessarily changing the food, we're just changing how we're sometimes preparing it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal products and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/government-eat-more-butter-full-fat-milk-dietary-guidelines-dairy-2026-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;full-fat dairy products&lt;/a&gt; like beef tallow, butter, and cream contain saturated fat, which can drive up our LDL or "bad cholesterol levels, Landry said. If a person has too much LDL cholesterol in their blood, it can form a sticky plaque in their arteries, putting them at greater risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need fat as part of a balanced diet, but unsaturated fats, found in foods such as avocados, fatty fish, nuts, and olive oil, don't raise our LDL cholesterol nearly as much as saturated fat, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="92ff2c6c-ba8f-4601-94f3-06f8a5c0fe3b" data-toc-id="92ff2c6c-ba8f-4601-94f3-06f8a5c0fe3b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Switch from red meat to poultry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      Red and processed meats are linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.

              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There's one finding that keeps cropping up in Landry's research: reducing red meat consumption lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landry worked on a 2023 study in which 22 pairs of identical twins were assigned either a vegan or an omnivorous diet for eight weeks. It was the focus of a Netflix documentary titled "You Are What You Eat: A Twin Experiment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the study, the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/omnivore-vs-vegan-diet-vegan-lost-more-weight-lower-cholesterol-2024-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;vegan twins&lt;/a&gt; had lower LDL cholesterol and insulin levels, and had lost more weight, another risk factor for cardiovascular disease, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean you have to cut out meat entirely, Landry said, but he recommended swapping red and processed meats, including beef, pork, and sausages, for leaner options like poultry, such as chicken and turkey, or fish, which are lower in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also a good idea to add plant-based protein sources to your diet. "Eventually, I would love for folks to even move further than that and start consuming some plant-based proteins, some beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh. Those are great things for our heart as well," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="f2310b17-c86f-481d-9b8f-929fd5162d13" data-toc-id="f2310b17-c86f-481d-9b8f-929fd5162d13"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Swap white carbs for whole-wheat versions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      Swap out white toast for wholemeal or seeded bread.
                      
              &lt;span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name="image-source" itemprop="creditText"&gt;

              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fiber is great at keeping &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nutritionist-lowered-cholesterol-4-simple-ways-eat-more-fiber-2026-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;"nice and stable," Landry said, but most Americans don't eat enough. Ninety percent of women, and 97% of men, don't meet the recommended 30 grams of fiber a day, according to the 2020 to 2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The 2025 to 2030 guidelines recommend two to four servings of whole grains a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, and whole-wheat bread are good sources of fiber and can easily replace their white counterparts, which tend to be low in fiber. One cup of brown rice, for example, contains 3.5 grams of fiber, while a cup of white rice contains 0.6 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can still have bread, we can still have rice," Landry, said, "but the whole grain version."&lt;/p&gt;
            
            
            &lt;/section&gt;
