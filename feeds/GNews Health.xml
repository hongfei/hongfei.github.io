(NMDOH). Nine cases have been confirmed in Lea County, which borders Texas. Of the nine cases, four are among children, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank"&gt;NMDOH&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This death underscores the real danger of measles -- it's a severe disease that can take lives despite being preventable with vaccination," said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and ABC News contributor. "Every new case is a reminder of why vaccination is critical. Tragically, with an outbreak of this scale, a fatal case was not unexpected, especially among those unvaccinated. Given how contagious measles is, we anticipate more cases in the coming weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;During Tuesday's Cabinet meeting, Health and &amp;amp; Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded to a question about the outbreak, saying the agency was following the cases in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Kennedy appeared to downplay the outbreak, noting there have been four outbreaks so far this year compared to 16 last year. However, the number of cases in Texas alone amount to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;nearly half of the 285 cases confirmed in 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It's not unusual; we have measles outbreaks every year," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to humans.

One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective. Most vaccinated adults don't need a booster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, due to the highly effective vaccination program, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Watching your hair gray and your skin crease has long been considered an inevitable part of life, but a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074293" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; has revealed promising avenues for combating visible signs of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/19/health/controversial-supplements-can-get-rid-of-zombie-cells-that-speed-up-aging/"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some antiaging skin care does employ hormones — mainly &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/article/best-retinol-cream-serum/"&gt;retinol&lt;/a&gt; and tretinoin in topical retinoids, as well as estrogen, which treats symptoms related to menopause. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers in Germany have identified a much wider variety of hormones that may have the potential to turn back time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;German researchers have identified a wide variety of hormones that could have antiaging effects. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;wayhome.studio  – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our paper highlights key hormone players that orchestrate pathways of skin aging such as degradation of connective tissue (leading to wrinkling), stem cell survival and loss of pigment (leading to hair graying),” said lead study author &lt;a href="https://www.growkudos.com/profile/Markus_B%C3%B6hm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Markus Böhm&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatology professor at the University of Münster.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some of the hormones we studied have antiaging properties and may be used in the future as agents to prevent skin aging.”   &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The researchers wanted to better understand how hormones affect skin aging, so they focused on insulin-like growth factor-1, growth hormone, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/health/you-may-be-able-to-delay-menopause-with-your-sex-life/"&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt;, retinoids and melatonin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Melatonin stood out as a promising antiaging treatment because it is a small, affordable and well-tolerated molecule that also acts as an &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/health/a-handful-of-this-snack-can-boost-mood-and-reduce-cancer-risk/"&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; and helps regulate energy production in cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most widely known as a hormone that helps regulate sleep-wake cycles, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/04/health/dont-take-melatonin-supplements-for-insomnia-sleep-doctors/"&gt;melatonin&lt;/a&gt; can be found naturally in milk, which contains an amino acid called tryptophan that the body converts into melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Melatonin, primarily known for helping you sleep, can be found naturally in tart cherries. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;fortyforks – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Melatonin can also be found in high amounts in nuts (especially almonds, pistachios and walnuts), some fish (tuna and salmon) and tart cherries — the key ingredient in the TikTok-famous &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/02/health/i-tried-the-sleepy-girl-mocktail-insomnia-cure-the-viral-fad-works-but-theres-one-problem/"&gt;Sleepy Girl Mocktail&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the identified hormones had surprising effects on skin and hair aging, especially in people with certain genetic conditions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="single__inline-module inline-module inline-module--newsletter aligncenter aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-newsletter" data-source-unit="Inline Newsletter Module Post Care"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-module__inner"&gt;

			&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at other hormones, such as α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (which controls skin color), hormones from the thyroid system, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/24/health/this-nasal-spray-might-be-the-cure-to-loneliness/"&gt;oxytocin&lt;/a&gt; and endocannabinoids (found in CBD products). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you get older, your skin experiences intrinsic aging — a natural process that follows the passage of time — and extrinsic aging — aging due to external factors, such as sun exposure, air pollution, smoking, poor diet, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/health/just-1-sleepless-night-is-as-bad-for-your-immune-system-as-obesity-study/"&gt;lack of sleep&lt;/a&gt; and stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Some of the hormones we studied have antiaging properties and may be used in the future as agents to prevent skin aging,” lead study author Markus Böhm said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;triocean – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that these hormones could help protect skin from sun damage, slow signs of aging and influence hair pigmentation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings were published Tuesday in the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/edrv/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1210/endrev/bnae034/8029650" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;journal Endocrine Reviews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Skin is not only a target for various hormones that control pathways of skin aging, but itself is certainly the largest and richest site for hormone production besides classical endocrine glands,” Böhm said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Further research into these hormones may offer opportunities to develop new therapeutics for treating and preventing skin aging.” &lt;/p&gt;

In short, it's even more evidence demonstrating the importance of COVID vaccines, not just for adults, but for kids as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an extremely important topic now that the Trump administration is &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-administrations-attacks-on-science-in-first-30-days/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;systematically trying to defund scientific research&lt;/a&gt; — a &lt;a href="https://www.biospace.com/business/trumps-whiplash-policies-keep-pharmas-on-their-toes" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;bizarre change of tune&lt;/a&gt;, considering Trump was behind a concerted effort called Operation Warp Speed in the early days of the pandemic to speed up the development of COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As detailed in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830556" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;one of the two studies&lt;/a&gt;, published this week in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, a team of US-based pediatricians and CDC researchers found that COVID-19 vaccinations were associated with a 57 percent drop in the odds of developing one or more post-COVID condition symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the mRNA-based vaccines that have become commonplace since the global pandemic are highly effective at warding off long COVID in children aged five to 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that effectiveness is as relevant as it was during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that children should stay up to date with current COVID-19 vaccination recommendations as vaccination not only protects against severe COVID-19 illness but also protects against [long COVID]," the researchers wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830557" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;separate cohort study&lt;/a&gt;, also published this week in the same journal, found that "concerns that young athletes with COVID-19 would be at increased risk of myocarditis and sudden cardiac arrest" were unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international team of researchers compared instances of cardiac deaths that occurred before and during the pandemic, and found "no increase" in either of these conditions after it struck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2024/04/11/cdc-finds-no-link-between-covid-vaccines-and-cardiac-death-in-young-people/?sh=650e6ec1577f" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;builds on existing evidence&lt;/a&gt; that there's no link between the disease and cardiac death in young people. In early 2023, the media was awash with reports of young athletes reportedly suffering cardiac arrest as a result of a COVID infection, lingering rumors that &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/01/damar-hamlin-cardiac-arrest-covid-anti-vaccine-heart-theories/672644/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;persisted&lt;/a&gt; despite &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-covid-vaccines-athlete-deaths-1500-989195878254" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;sustained efforts to debunk them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an especially pertinent topic now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken over as Trump's health secretary. Kennedy has previously questioned the scientific consensus that childhood vaccines don't cause autism and has denied that COVID vaccines have saved millions of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/18/rfk-jr-covid-19-vaccinations" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported last month&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy's non-profit, the Children's Health Defense, reportedly tried to block new COVID vaccinations from being rolled out during the height of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where his staunchly anti-vaccine stance will leave the future role of vaccinations in the United States remains unclear at best. His appointment has already proven highly controversial. Kennedy clashed with Democrats during his Senate confirmation hearing in January after &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/rfk-jr-senate-confirmation-hearing" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;making contradictory statements&lt;/a&gt; regarding the effectiveness of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Trump has announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;so-called "Make America Healthy Again" Commission&lt;/a&gt;, to be led by Kennedy. The new body is set to take aim at the alleged overprescription of drugs for the treatment of ADHD and the prevalence of autism and asthma in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have also warned that Kennedy's vaccine cynicism could &lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/kennedy-rfk-jr-polio-eradication-public-health-vaccine" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;greatly undermine US efforts to eradicate polio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an unfortunate prognosis for the future of public health. With the Trump administration declaring war on lifesaving scientific research and Kennedy vowing to &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2025/02/19/rfk-jr-investigate-childhood-vaccine-schedule-promising-not-change/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;probe the safety of childhood vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, very few, if any, lessons appear to have been learned following the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on COVID vaccines: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/donald-trump-rfk-jr-ban-vaccines" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Trump Threatens to Ban Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 16:36:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE1xOTZkRXo3YW15UGV3WlhqY29EOHZjekF4a2xOV1BaSTlyLVJxRzJ2TXV4NkU1YVZZVklfeG1sT3FONFppeDJ1b1ZNLTcyLUhfclFxV21lcW5iUjF0U3F5azRrM3ZzZDVjMTZ2bQ</guid></item><item><title>A Mystery Disease Has Killed Dozens So Far in Northwestern Congo - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPSVMwOW1MU3VGX3ZIRzVINjB3SFBZVFdPYk1uZFdoenp5aHNOU05CWkZzbTBvMUVWUktXVFpMZkhaUGdrMzA2ZUxlSXhGT0xHOVQ1MXhRbS1VQUJBTDZOUEtGQmpKQXhFeDRQbmFsVnMyVlRyeVlwQjlXWWJodHRjTmdiY2FtdmdNQ0xTOEdPdmwwbkVUcTNNNUozbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Something is killing people in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and no one knows what it is. World Health Organization officials have reported two clusters of a mystery illness in the area that has sickened hundreds and killed dozens in the past few weeks alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;WHO officials in the African Region released the &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/380529/OEW7-1016022025.pdf"&gt;latest update&lt;/a&gt; on the situation last Thursday. So far, there have been 431 cases and 53 deaths attributed to an unknown illness in northwestern DRC dating back to January. Initial tests have ruled out established suspects like Ebola and Marburg, and it’s still unclear whether there’s a single culprit to blame.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DRC officials reported the newest cases in mid-February. The largest and latest outbreak is occurring in Bomate Village, with at least 419 people sickened and 45 dead as of February 15. Several weeks earlier, a cluster of illness was also reported in Boloko Village. At least 12 cases and eight deaths were documented in Boloko and the nearby village of Danda.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the two outbreaks are in the same region (the Équateur Province), it’s not certain yet whether they are truly connected. People in both outbreaks have experienced similar symptoms, which include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, abdominal pain, and headache. Some people have also experienced hemorrhaging (potentially life-threatening blood loss), but tests for Ebola and Marburg virus—well-known causes of hemorrhagic fever—have come up negative in both outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whatever the cause, it’s rapidly striking victims down. In nearly half of the deaths, people have succumbed to their illness within 48 hours, and the overall mortality rate is currently around 10%. The limited medical resources and general isolation of these villages is also hampering efforts to treat cases and identify the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The situation in Équateur Province presents significant public health risk, with two clusters of an unknown disease causing high morbidity and mortality,” WHO officials wrote in their report. “The remote geography and limited healthcare infrastructure exacerbate response challenges, with overwhelmed health facilities struggling to manage cases.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unknown clusters of illness occasionally happen in the world, and usually, they’re eventually identified as something established. Last December, for instance, an &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-mysterious-illness-is-killing-people-in-southwestern-congo-2000534031"&gt;outbreak of a mystery deadly illness&lt;/a&gt; in a different part of the DRC was ultimately attributed to a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/congos-health-ministry-says-unknown-disease-is-severe-malaria-2024-12-17/"&gt;severe form of malaria&lt;/a&gt; (likely aided by high rates of malnutrition in the area). Rarely, however, these clusters do lead to the discovery of a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-mysterious-virus-is-sickening-people-in-china-1840857359"&gt;new disease-causing germ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, WHO officials say that the most likely possibilities for these latest outbreaks are malaria, food or water poisoning, typhoid fever, meningitis, or some other type of viral hemorrhagic fever. Perhaps significantly, the first cases in the earlier cluster were found in young children who had recently eaten a bat carcass just before becoming sick. Bats are known to carry many viruses and bacteria that can sicken humans, and they’re considered &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cddiscovery201648"&gt;a major risk&lt;/a&gt; for the spread of novel diseases that could spill over into humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;WHO officials and extra medical supplies have been sent to the region to aid local doctors, and further genetic testing of patients’ samples is now underway.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

The M.R.I. could pick up on traces of cancer or other diseases, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But the post was too simple, the University of Sydney public health researcher Brooke Nickel thought when she saw it in August 2023. What about the possible harms, she wondered? The test might find an extremely early stage cancer that would lead to a patient receiving invasive treatment, even though it may never have progressed to something more serious. Ms. Kardashian’s post made it seem like there were only upsides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That post, and others like it, prompted Dr. Nickel to look into how other celebrities and influencers promote increasingly popular medical tests such as &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/well/live/mri-prenuvo-full-body-scan.html" title=""&gt;full-body M.R.I. scans&lt;/a&gt;. They also examined posts for products that claim to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/10/health/cancer-blood-tests.html" title=""&gt;detect cancer in blood&lt;/a&gt; or analyze &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/16/health/fertility-test-ovarian-reserve.html" title=""&gt;a hormone&lt;/a&gt; linked to fertility, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/03/well/live/men-tesosterone-tests-ads.html" title=""&gt;testosterone levels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/22/well/eat/gut-microbiome-health.html" title=""&gt;the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The results of that study, which scrutinized nearly 1,000 TikTok and Instagram posts from accounts with hundreds of millions of combined followers, were &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830758" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday.&lt;/a&gt; The paper found that an overwhelming majority of these posts were misleading, painting an overly rosy picture of these tests and rarely including scientific evidence.

None of the cases in New Mexico have led to hospitalizations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The outbreak comes amid growing concerns among public health experts about declining vaccination rates and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/us/rfk-jr-hhs-senate-confirmation.html" title=""&gt;the confirmation of Robert F.

However, in the last year or so, this naturally occurring hormone has entered the limelight of social media. Indeed, you can find videos on TikTok discussing "&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/do-you-have-cortisol-face-expert/" target="_self"&gt;cortisol face&lt;/a&gt;" with millions of views. Unfortunately, trends are rarely as simple as they appear and may have people jumping into action before learning what cortisol supplements even are and how they react in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;While cortisol supplements can be the right choice in some situations, it's essential to understand the myriad factors that come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is cortisol, and how is it related to stress?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol is often called the "&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/cortisol-why-this-important-stress-hormone-is-important-for-your-health/" target="_self"&gt;stress hormone&lt;/a&gt;" and is released by the adrenal glands -- part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, a bodily system that regulates the stress response --  when our bodies experience stress. It helps our bodies respond to threatening experiences while managing several facets of our biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol regulates blood sugar, suppresses inflammation, regulates metabolism, is involved in our circadian rhythms and influences the fight-or-flight reaction. It's essential for survival. Because &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538239/#:~:text=Though%20widely%20known%20as%20the,production%20and%20secretion%20of%20cortisol." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone&lt;/a&gt;, and most of our body tissue has glucocorticoid receptors, cortisol can have a broad and ubiquitous effect throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary aspects can also influence our cortisol levels, according to &lt;a href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/diogo-barardo/en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Diogo Barardo&lt;/a&gt;, Ph.D., director of R&amp;amp;D at biotechnology company Novos Core. For instance, higher levels of sugar and saturated fats in a diet can negatively increase cortisol levels. Conversely, a diet high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains may lower cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond diet, though, several other factors can influence your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/stressed-tired-cortisol-imbalance-symptoms/" target="_self"&gt;cortisol levels&lt;/a&gt;. These factors include some medications, alcohol, caffeine, adrenal gland tumors, athletic activity, pregnancy and a variety of health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Yurii Yarema/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High cortisol symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Excessively high cortisol levels, especially when sustained over time, can be damaging. Chronic high cortisol can also negatively affect metabolic health by promoting insulin resistance and inflammatory processes," said Barardo. In some cases, high cortisol levels could be a sign of Cushing disease, also known as hypercortisolism, a progressive pituitary disease that causes the body to overproduce cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of high cortisol can vary between individuals. They include weight gain in the face and abdomen, fat buildup under the shoulder blades, purple stretchmarks across the abdomen, decreasing muscle strength, high blood sugar, hypertension, excessive hair growth in women and osteoporosis. &lt;a href="https://drbrighten.com/high-cortisol-and-cognitive-function/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Mental symptoms can include&lt;/a&gt; brain fog, memory issues and irritability. While this captures many of the possible symptoms, it may not contain all of them. In many cases, people will only experience some of these symptoms when they have high cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you experience symptoms of high cortisol, consider speaking with a medical expert about the risks of high cortisol and Cushing disease. On the other hand, if you have dangerously low cortisol levels, you will want to discuss Addison's disease. Thankfully, you can consult a physician and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/i-got-a-cortisol-blood-stress-test-heres-what-i-learned-and-how-it-affected-my-lifestyle/" target="_self"&gt;test your cortisol levels&lt;/a&gt;. Ruling out such illnesses, however, may require several tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol tests are often performed using blood samples but can also be done through urinary analysis. Because the urinary analysis test uses a series of inputs over 24 hours, this test may yield more accurate results than blood tests, which often only capture cortisol data from one point in a person's day. As Barardo has said, "This captures cortisol fluctuations throughout the day rather than at one single point in time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best supplements to potentially reduce cortisol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are dietary factors that can increase or decrease cortisol levels, the supplements that aid in this do so indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cortisol itself isn't typically supplemented directly, but certain supplements may help regulate cortisol," Barardo said. "Certain supplements like magnesium, vitamin C, Rhodiola rosea and pterostilbene [the primary antioxidant component of blueberries] are studied for their potential to help regulate cortisol and mitigate the stress response." He said that each of these compounds has the potential to affect cortisol levels through "modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Yana Iskayeva/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C may be one of the top potential supplements to reduce cortisol and is readily abundant in several formats. However, how much of this supplement you should take will vary between products. To ensure you're safe, read the product guidelines to ensure you don't exceed the recommended amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38010274/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;study published in 2023&lt;/a&gt; found that vitamin C can reduce cortisol levels in some patients with hypercortisolemia. "Vitamin C plays a notable role in cortisol modulation, particularly under stress, through its influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis," Barardo said. "Research demonstrates that vitamin C can reduce excessive cortisol production in response to both psychological and physical stressors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C can be found naturally in several foods that are commonly available. All citrus fruits have vitamin C within them, but so do potatoes, peppers, strawberries, broccoli and Brussel sprouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ashwagandha&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This plant is considered an adaptogenic herb, meaning it's believed to help the body manage and reduce stress responses. The US National Institute of Health states within its &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;fact sheet on ashwagandha&lt;/a&gt; (Withania somnifera) that "several randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, most of them fairly small in size and of short duration, have found that ashwagandha may reduce perceived stress and anxiety and improve the quality and duration of sleep." However, because these studies used different ashwagandha preparations and doses, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific recommendation for a specific supplement to reduce cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's rare to find this plant in everyday recipes, but it can be found as a dietary supplement in several forms ranging from powders to gummies to beverages. How much you should take will vary between these products, so checking the directions before use is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Anna Blazhuk/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has pursued the idea of omega-3 fatty acids having a reductive effect on cortisol levels. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8510994/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;paper published in 2021&lt;/a&gt; found that participants who took high levels of omega-3 had lower levels of cortisol when compared to the placebo group. How much of this you can safely eat daily is based on your age, with a &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;recommended intake table&lt;/a&gt; on the National Institute for Health covering each age category. For men over age 14, 1.6 grams daily is recommended, while women over 14 should consume 1.1 grams daily. Those who are pregnant or lactating should consume more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are found in many foods but are especially common in fish, like salmon, mackerel and tuna, and some types of seeds, such as flaxseed, chia seeds and walnuts. Omega-3s can also be obtained as a dietary supplement in various forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rhodiola rosea&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As an adaptogen, Rhodiola rosea supports the body's stress response by modulating the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis," Barardo said. "This axis plays a central role in cortisol production, and Rhodiola's effects help balance cortisol levels rather than simply suppress or elevate them, which is characteristic of adaptogens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19016404/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;a 2009 study&lt;/a&gt;, repeated doses of Rhodiola rosea can have "an anti-fatigue effect that increases mental performance, particularly the ability to concentrate, and decreases cortisol response to awakening stress in burnout patients with fatigue syndrome." Exact dosages for this compound will vary between products, but each supplement for lowering cortisol should include recommended intakes on its packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Boonchai Wedmakawand/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pterostilbene&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pterostilbene, an antioxidant mainly found in blueberries, has been found to improve stress-related behaviors. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33739881/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;study published in 2021&lt;/a&gt; tested pterostilbene treatments on mice, and their findings "suggest that pterostilbene may effectively modulate stress-related abnormal behaviors, neuroinflammation and HPA axis hyperactivity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although direct studies on pterostilbene's effect on cortisol are still emerging, early evidence suggests it could support a balanced stress response through neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, which may make it beneficial in chronic stress scenarios," Barardo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol supplements utilizing pterostilbene may be less common but should contain specific recommended intakes for each product if available. As for food sources, aside from blueberries, pterostilbene can be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36234852/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;found in grapes and peanuts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are these supplements safe and necessary?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While supplements to lower cortisol may be generally safe for most people, they are not the only way to regulate stress. Whether or not these cortisol supplements are necessary will vary between individuals and circumstances; most individuals without cortisol-related illnesses should be okay without them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Supplements that help regulate cortisol are generally safe, but they're not always necessary for everyone," Barardo said. "A healthy lifestyle that includes &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/7-stress-relieving-tactics-that-will-help-you-reach-your-carefree-era/" target="_self"&gt;stress management practices&lt;/a&gt; can help maintain optimal cortisol levels naturally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help reduce stress levels without needing cortisol supplements, people may be interested in practicing meditation, yoga, pursuing other athletic activities or finding various means of coping with high stress. Research has underscored a variety of mechanisms for reducing stress, with a strong emphasis on what's called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513300/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;mindfulness-based stress reduction&lt;/a&gt;. Although these techniques can be very effective in some cases, not everyone is equally inclined towards mindfulness practices, and learning these techniques without a guide can be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When considering cortisol supplements, it's important to know that the FDA does not regulate supplements. Hence, the requirements for accuracy, transparency and testing are often less than expected. Barardo also points out, "Over-reliance on supplements marketed as cortisol regulators may not address the root causes of stress or high cortisol."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Tetra Images/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about cortisol blockers?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol blockers, like mifepristone and pasireotide, are prescription medications &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24126229/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;used to treat Cushing's syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. They work by either blocking the uptake of cortisol to receptors or by preventing the release of cortisol in the first place. Beyond this particular class of medication, some people may also refer to supplements and tactics for reducing cortisol levels as blockers, but the difference can be vast. Companies marketing over-the-counter cortisol blockers often rebrand cortisol supplements or other approaches for lowering cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cortisol blocker medications, there can be side effects that your doctor will discuss with you if you're prescribed these medications. These side effects vary between specific cortisol blocker medications. However, these medications are FDA-approved for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to cortisol supplements and stress-coping techniques, how safe they are will vary between supplements and techniques. Supplements should have recommended dosages but can be cross-checked against recommended intake levels for specific compounds, like magnesium or vitamin C. However, it is essential to remember that the FDA does not regulate supplements. Always consult with your healthcare provider before taking any supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to naturally reduce cortisol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to influence and reduce your cortisol levels naturally. How well these approaches work will vary between individuals and instances, with some approaches becoming more effective with practice or time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce cortisol levels, Barardo recommends regular exercise, a balanced diet and engaging in meditation and mindfulness.  "Vitamin C-rich foods and a healthy lifestyle that includes sleep and physical activity are also effective at keeping cortisol levels in check," he added. "Additionally, interacting with loved ones and &lt;a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2018/02/power-pets" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;pets can lower cortisol&lt;/a&gt; and increase serotonin, improving mental health, reducing stress and helping people live longer, healthier lives." Avoiding foods that put excess stress on the body, like caffeine or alcohol, is also recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human health is often seen as holistic, wherein improving health metrics in one area will also increase health in other areas. Many of these approaches for reducing cortisol involve increasing general areas of health. Pursuing &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/stress-less-live-more-7-mental-health-hacks-for-year-round-happiness/" target="_self"&gt;better mental and emotional well-being&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, can be linked to better cortisol regulation. The tactics mentioned above fold in several approaches that can help mitigate stress and encourage a reduction in cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you may be otherwise healthy, but your body still produces more cortisol than expected. If continuing to pursue natural methods for cortisol regulation doesn't help you, then it might be wise to speak with a medical expert and test your cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol is known as the stress hormone because it's released in higher quantities during times of stress and enhances our fight, flight or freeze reactions. When overproduced  and sustained at high levels, this hormone can cause higher stress levels and discomfort and may also contribute to physical symptoms like "cortisol face."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various supplements, including vitamin C, ashwagandha, omega-3 fatty acids, Rhodiola rosea and pterostilbene, may help you lower your cortisol levels. However, there are many natural ways, like &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/5-beginner-breathing-exercises-that-will-help-banish-stress/" target="_self"&gt;mindfulness breathing exercises&lt;/a&gt;, to manage stress and cortisol that may pose less risk of side effects. Some cases of high cortisol could be indications of Cushing's syndrome, in which case medical assistance will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5tYmF0UHk0cmQ1SUNHUGZlX2tRejFQaDMwTjRjVFFaUkNtMjMtY0V5SzNGM0UzRWxUUnh3akVWb2hvd1lXZnB2VTNEUXBCRmZkSG1BTVJYLU9NMUNOWmZZN3otRW1WS3NLY1AtVGJYanh1UQ</guid></item><item><title>An Interview With My Cat About His Most Annoying Behaviors - Defector</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOT1JkOE5NSVFyLVIxek9oUXlsWDVOZjlFeW8zaUJtX1hjMEVoOTRGYy10dTJqQTRvM0ZpRU1EbWp4Qm55anUzX09qcTVnNHZVODhMeWNzdTJsbldJSmRrZHpJQ2ZfVGY2UUFqYnctVFh2eWtOYTZzRXppSzBfWW9IVERaVFN2dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="PostContent_content__FblEJ"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This week we're running a small package of essays on the topic of &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://defector.com/tag/nuisances" target="_blank"&gt;nuisances&lt;/a&gt;. Why? That's an annoying question.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like every other member of my generation who has put off traditional markers of adulthood, like home ownership and having children, I am completely, utterly devoted to my cat, Pong. In the five years he’s lived with us, Pong has evolved from the scrawny street cat we adopted in the Union Square Petco to the ruler of our household. We often quote a decade-old Adam Serwer tweet about his own cats: Management doesn’t need a union. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve invented a rich mythology for Pong’s inner life over the last five years. His hardscrabble early years taught him to flirt and charm for his meals on the streets of Harlem, where he developed his taste for French fries, noodles, and pizza. He ran with a tough crew that wasn’t afraid to get into scraps if he needed to assert dominance. He inherited his asthma and anxiety from his mother (me), and he spends his days working hard (sleeping on a chair in my office) for the money to pay our rent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any relationship, you fall into rhythms built around each other’s quirks and scar tissue. This is true even—or maybe especially—when the relationship is with an animal who cannot speak English. We’ve come to accept his most annoying behaviors; his loafing on our backs at 5 a.m. like a sleep paralysis demon is just a part of life with Pong, as are the lost hours of sleep and frequent yelling when he can’t find us in the house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been curious about meeting with a pet communicator, a type of psychic who can allegedly connect with your pet on the spiritual plane and translate their animal thoughts to English words. Against my better judgment, I am woo woo-curious and have spent hundreds of dollars on supernatural services over the years like aura readings, natal charts, and tarot spreads. Do I believe that animal communicators are 100-percent saying what they claim to do? Not necessarily. But I don't &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; believe in them, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got a recommendation for a pet communicator, whose identity I’m keeping private at their request, and booked a 30-minute session with them. We met on Zoom, and when they started looking for his energy, they asked if he’s a male, six to eight years old, who’s very sure of himself. Pong was sleeping next to me in a little kitty croissant but the communicator couldn't see him on screen. I told them they had the right guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What follows is an interview with Pong, through the communicator, which I’ve edited for clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, I’m very tired this morning because you were super active last night, walking around the bed, pawing at our faces, and talking to us. I feel like you do this more often when we’ve recently been traveling. What’s going on? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to catch up. You come back from a trip with all these new smells and I want to reconnect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The communicator said here that they were noticing a bit of insecurity too, which Pong wouldn’t say himself.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything I can do to help you with the insecurity you feel when we leave?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's not anything that you're doing wrong  It's more just like when somebody leaves and you miss them. It doesn't matter if they say, “I'll come back and I'll bring you a souvenir or something.” You're still going to miss them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, that makes sense. I do wish you'd let us sleep through the night, though. Something else I wanted to bring up: It seems like you really don’t like it when either of us goes into the bathroom. You stand outside the door and cry, and stick your paw under the door in the most desperate way. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are you keeping me out? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, it’s basically like a human litter box, and we want to have some private time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No need to keep me out, though. I’m not worried about you in there, but I just want you to remember I’m here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The communicator noted again that they were picking up on insecurity, like a mild separation anxiety, which was interesting because the first thing they noticed about Pong was his confidence. Maybe a bit of bravado?) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there something you’d like to do in the bathroom together?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sounds of the water are interesting. We could go at that together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mean play with the water? You do seem pretty curious about the shower and bathtub. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to bathe in it, but I’m curious about how the water moves. It’s like a science experiment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The communicator recommended I look into water enrichment toys for cats.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell me anything about your life before you came to live with us? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There wasn’t a loving family, but there were two or three people who took care of me on the street. There was one man who I had a strong relationship with. There was a misunderstanding, the people tried to bring me into the house, and then took me away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This made me think of Alex, the doorman who apparently fed him when he was a stray, and who he was named for when he was brought to Union Square. Yes, we should’ve kept that name.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m sorry that happened, but I hope you’re happy now that you’ve been with us! One thing I’ve noticed about you is that you don’t really have much of a hunting instinct. If there is ever a bug in the house, you might watch it or bat at it, but you won’t stalk and kill it. We’re going to be moving pretty soon, and there’s a good chance that we’re moving somewhere that will have a mouse problem. Do you think you could help us with that? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uh … what am I supposed to do with a mouse? Do I eat it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t think we’d want you to eat it. You could maybe bring it to us, but that’s kind of gross. I guess ideally I’d want you to just scare them away so they aren’t a problem. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you don’t want me to be friends with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, that would probably not be ideal.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hm … all right. I’m not really sure what to expect, but  I'm just going to do my thing and just chill, maybe they'll get the hint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I appreciate that. OK, one last question. Sometimes you’ll crawl up onto my lap and be really sweet and snuggly, and then out of nowhere you’ll start attacking me, biting me and breaking skin. It really sucks when that happens! What’s going on? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel like I’m back on the street and it just happens. It feels right in the moment, but when you get upset I feel ashamed. I saw the tissues with the blood last week and I feel bad. It’s not your fault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks. Last week was rough and my fingers are still healing from it! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The communicator told him that when he starts to feel emotional like that, the best thing he can do is to walk away.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, I can work on that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you.

						Police are warning beachgoers on Sunset Beach in North Carolina to be aware of dead birds. The Sunset Police Department said officers are aware of multiple deceased common loons in the area. Police said they cannot confirm if bird flu is the cause due to state laboratories being overwhelmed with samples."For your safety, please do not touch or handle any deceased birds or wildlife," a Facebook post from police said. "Proper disposal protocols are being followed. If you come across any additional deceased birds or other animals, please contact the Sunset Beach Police Department immediately via 911."

            &lt;strong&gt;(CNN) — &lt;/strong&gt;By now, many people have heard that a diet packed with ultraprocessed foods is not good for us. They have been linked to a host of ills, including obesity, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/14/health/ultraprocessed-food-disease-wellness/index.html"&gt;diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10512104/" target="_blank"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-stroke-cognitive-decline-wellness/index.html"&gt;cognitive decline and stroke&lt;/a&gt; — they even appear to increase our &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/01/health/worst-ultraprocessed-food-early-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;chance of early death&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00123b6mq8stdh7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultraprocessed foods, according to the &lt;a href="https://ecuphysicians.ecu.edu/wp-content/pv-uploads/sites/78/2021/07/NOVA-Classification-Reference-Sheet.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA Food Classification system&lt;/a&gt;, are food products made with ingredients you wouldn’t normally find in a supermarket or your kitchen (such as certain individual nutrients, flavor enhancers, colors, additives, stabilizers); they might also be made using &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/01/health/predigested-food-wellness/index.html"&gt;industrial manufacturing processes &lt;/a&gt;(such as extrusion, molding and preprocessing) not available to the home chef.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00133b6mkpfzov3x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But anyone who has ever munched on a bag of cheese puffs, heated a frozen pizza for dinner, packed cookies in their kid’s lunch bag or downed a refreshing soda knows these foods can be tasty and convenient. They are also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6558394/" target="_blank"&gt;often cheaper&lt;/a&gt; than making a dish from scratch, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/health/child-addiction-ultraprocessed-foods-wellness/index.html"&gt;hard to resist&lt;/a&gt; (thanks to hyper-palatability formulations) and even harder to avoid: &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/8/1704" target="_blank"&gt;Up to 70% of the US food supply&lt;/a&gt; is made up of ultraprocessed foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00143b6mhppyw6xa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet many questions remain: Are they all bad? And exactly what can make them unhealthy. That’s why researchers are asking whether some of those chemicals, additives and flavorings &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/17/health/red-40-food-dyes-wellness/index.html"&gt;are somehow harmful&lt;/a&gt;? Or do some of these ingredients interact with our bodies through &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/20/health/no-calorie-ultraprocessed-food-depression-wellness/index.html"&gt;our microbiome or our immune system&lt;/a&gt;, unleashing downstream health effects that we don’t yet understand? Or do ultraprocessed foods &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10924027/" target="_blank"&gt;cause us to gain weight,&lt;/a&gt; which in turn sets us up for conditions that are associated with obesity, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l41kc000003b6m25yr3pmq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers like Dr. Kevin Hall, a section chief at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (part of the National Institutes of Health), are trying to find out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00173b6mq306hank@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hall and his team authored &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(19)30248-7" target="_blank"&gt;a groundbreaking study published in 2019&lt;/a&gt;  that found people on an ultraprocessed diet ate on average 500 more calories a day than people on a similar but minimally processed diet (matched for calories offered, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00183b6m3ebi9rpr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, Hall and his team &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-us-dietary-guidelines-wellness/index.html"&gt;are conducting a new trial&lt;/a&gt; to try to understand the mechanisms driving people to overconsume calories. He has two theories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00193b6mvneebyj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One is their energy density — so how many calories you’re getting in each gram of food you’re eating,” CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on the Chasing Life podcast. Tirrell visited Hall’s lab to meet one of the participants of his new trial, which (like the first trial) involves living at the NIH for about four weeks and eating diets made up of differently processed foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b001a3b6ms3cmh1uw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It so happens that ultraprocessed foods are &lt;a href="https://inddex.nutrition.tufts.edu/data4diets/indicator/percent-energy-comprised-ultra-processed-foods" target="_blank"&gt;much more energy-dense&lt;/a&gt; than minimally processed foods,” Tirrell said. “And (Hall) says, really, that’s because they take a lot of the water out of them so that they don’t rot. They’re more shelf stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b001b3b6m1biwxw2e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And then the other thing (Hall’s) hypothesizing is their hyper-palatability, or we’ve heard the term the ‘bliss point.’ So, it’s this combination of salt, sugar, fat and carbs in just the right levels that make us not want to stop eating foods.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cm7jfejuj00023b6mfylz499l@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7kynsyo000x3b6mssncypnr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hall’s new trial is studying 36 people, for one month each, cycling them through four diets. “One is minimally processed; one is ultraprocessed — very similar to the first trial: high hyper-palatability, high energy-dense,” Tirrell explained. “And then two other diets … they’re ultraprocessed, but they vary how hyper-palatable they are and how energy-dense they are.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001e3b6m5bsrgsij@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And what (Hall’s) trying to see is — can you eat a diet that’s made up mostly of ultraprocessed foods, but that doesn’t drive overeating, and perhaps all of the other health effects of that, if it’s less energy-dense or if it’s less hyper-palatable?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001f3b6mmvcvmaz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not everyone views ultraprocessed foods as problematic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001g3b6meb3jrc2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Attempting to classify foods as unhealthy simply because they are processed, or demonizing food by ignoring its full nutrient content, misleads consumers and exacerbates health disparities,” Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of product policy at the Consumer Brands Association, said in an emailed statement. CBA is the trade group that represents the US manufacturers of consumer packaged goods, including food and beverages.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001h3b6mqw7vgtji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Companies adhere to the rigorous evidence-based safety standards established by the FDA to deliver safe, affordable and convenient products that consumers depend on every day,” Gallo said. She also noted there is currently no agreed-upon scientific definition of ultraprocessed foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001i3b6masiirad6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Tera Fazzino, an associate professor of psychology and the associate director of the Cofrin Logan Center for Addiction Research and Treatment at the University of Kansas, knows a thing or two about ultraprocessed foods and hyper-palatability. She developed a system to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31689013/" target="_blank"&gt;measure the hyper-palatability of different foods&lt;/a&gt;. She also collaborated with Hall and two of his NIH colleagues on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00688-4" target="_blank"&gt;a 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; that found hyper-palatable foods, energy-dense foods and eating rate are all linked to more calories being consumed on four different diets.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001j3b6mquxvuylh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Hyper-palatable foods contain combinations of palatability-related nutrients — so, fat, sugar, sodium and starchy carbohydrates — at thresholds that aren’t typically found together in nature,” she explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001k3b6ml0twcu7r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fazzino said hyper-palatable foods activate our brain’s opioid receptors and our dopamine reward neurocircuitry, which leads us to keep eating and seek out more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001l3b6m2sx3kmtz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The problem with hyper-palatable foods is, due to their nutrient combinations, they are particularly strong reinforcers,” she said. “They can be acutely rewarding to consume in the moment. And they can also garner a really strong motivational drive for us to continue seeking out and consuming these foods.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001m3b6md9mpc3ex@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fazzino’s research found hyper-palatable foods fall into three categories. “One group has elevated fat and sodium; a second group has elevated fat and sugar. And then the third group has elevated starchy carbohydrates and sodium,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001n3b6mgkuyqbke@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fat and sodium hyper-palatable foods are a lot of our meal-based items, things that we eat on the regular,” she explained. “That would be meat-based dishes, mixed dishes like meat and mashed potatoes, and things like that.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001o3b6m8zdjt6yf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fat and sugar (group) really are the sweets, the desserts,” she said. “The starchy carbohydrate and sodium hyper-palatable foods are a lot of our snacks. So, things that maybe even might not seem so problematic or so obvious as maybe (chips), like pretzels (and) most US-produced crackers.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001p3b6miiv672x6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fazzino said our bodies haven’t evolved to handle these foods. Whole foods found in nature “activate our brain reward neuro-circuitry and that’s a survival process,” she said. “Eating is fundamentally … a reinforcement-based process, and it needs to be enjoyable to make sure that we survive.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001q3b6mlp70an1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hyper-palatable foods hijack that process because they are engineered to hit &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/19/health/bliss-point-addictive-food/index.html"&gt;the bliss point&lt;/a&gt; with their magic combination of fat, sugar, sodium and starchy carbohydrates, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001r3b6mcqjl1q8s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That is creating almost like this euphoric experience that doesn’t typically come from whole foods,” she explained. “And the problem with that is that that has underlying neurobiological   impacts. It’s excessively activating our brain reward neural circuitry that already happens with whole foods.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001s3b6maq7i0w21@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why it’s all too easy to overindulge in those foods, she said. “They can cause us to overeat in the moment, but then also there’s this kind of feedback loop where they can become really strong reinforcers and drive our behavior in a way that whole and foundational foods don’t and shouldn’t.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001t3b6mv9dv034m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unfortunately, these foods are at the heart of the US food supply and have been growing. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37794529/" target="_blank"&gt;One of Fazzino’s studies&lt;/a&gt; found the prevalence of ultraprocessed, hyper-palatable and high energy-dense foods were all significantly higher in 2018 compared with 1988.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001u3b6mxx5365le@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And there is plenty of overlap between the three categories. “When we look at the food supply over time, by the time we get to 2018, we see that the vast majority of ultraprocessed foods are also hyper-palatable,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001v3b6m3zxpc1qt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What can you do to manage the amount of hyper-palatable foods you consume? Fazzino has these five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001w3b6mb712qb05@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pay attention to how your food is affecting you as you are eating it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of001x3b6mevjjlq4c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fazzino suggested this experiment: If you’re eating a bag of potato chips, does your brain tell you, get the next one, get the next one — before you have even swallowed? Or when you’re almost done with the bag, does your body tell you that you want more?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of001y3b6mdn759zjm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In contrast with, when you eat an apple, none of that extra stuff is going to be happening,” she said. “It’s going to be pleasant and you’re going to stop when you’re full.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of001z3b6ma4wxxzgi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Try to add foods to your diet that are whole and occurring in nature, which means they haven’t had anything done to them, Fazzino said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00203b6mj02v8bzy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whole foods that occur in nature, Fazzino said, typically have “one palatability-related nutrient,” such as the sugar in a whole apple.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00213b6mxu2oy3c5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those whole foods also include “satiety-promoting nutrients such as fiber, water and protein that slow their absorption and digestion into our system,” she said, noting that they won’t cause us to overeat or create a strong motivational drive to seek them out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00223b6mu8ubsauo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pay attention to the amount of salt in foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00233b6m8g1x96hz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One really robust commonality that we found in this work has been the presence of sodium as a nutrient that, when combined with either fat or starchy carbohydrates, can really be a vehicle for hyper-palatability,” Fazzino said, explaining that sodium “activates the opioid system in the brain.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00243b6m0bg2gwev@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We are often told to reduce sodium overall for our heart health, she said, but salt is not as well-known for contributing to hyper-palatability as fat and sugar are.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00253b6msaq91dgy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no magic sodium number or threshold used to determine whether the amount of salt in a particular food contributes to hyper-palatability. But Fazzino recommends people look for low-sodium options in the cracker aisle or the frozen dinner section, for example.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00263b6mudvet2ei@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fazzino also encouraged home cooks to keep sodium in mind, since a lot of ingredients have added salt. (Be mindful of the butter, cheese and sausage bits you may be adding to your omelet.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00273b6mkhy0btka@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Go light on what you add,” she said. “That will help to avoid the hyper-palatability piece.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00283b6mxrrezemw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stay away from food labels touting properties such as “diet,” “reduced fat” or “lean,” Fazzino recommended.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00293b6m13eot0i5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of the diet foods, as we found in our analysis of the food system, are hyper-palatable,” she said. Without the bliss point engineering, she noted, those foods would not be as palatable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of002a3b6mn3vlu917@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And when one key ingredient is reduced, another is often increased. These food products are marketed with less fat, for example, but maybe they contain more added sugar, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7l3a5dd002j3b6mplbveb2f@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="understand-the-deck-is-stacked-against-you" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Understand the deck is stacked against you
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of002b3b6miqzplb23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Be aware that hyper-palatable foods are designed to entice you.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of002c3b6mlz8w7sk8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re designed to be difficult to resist and difficult to stop eating Fazzino said. “And it’s not the individual’s fault.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of002d3b6mwqhh0nij@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultimately, Fazzino said systemic changes may be needed to meaningfully address the prevalence of these foods in the food supply.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7kyhmip000m3b6mykktjlig@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Where a young American woman lives could play a role in her risk for &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/women-health/what-is-metastatic-breast-cancer-how-is-it-treated-2661662925.html"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the breast cancer risk associated with a young woman’s locale is comparable to that from other known factors, such as genetics, researchers reported in a new study published recently in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10552-025-01968-7"&gt;Cancer Causes &amp;amp; Control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Breast cancer incidence is increasing in U.S. women under 40, but until now, it was unknown if incidence trends varied by U.S. geographic region,” lead researcher &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/rebecca-kehm-phd"&gt;Rebecca Kehm&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer among women under 40 increased by 0.5% a year between 2001 and 2020 across the United States, according to researchers’ analysis of cancer statistics drawn from all 50 states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that increase appears to have been driven by 21 states where early-onset breast cancer cases exceeded that average rate of increase, results show. Rates remained stable or decreased in the other states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, 12 states had a statistically significant increase in breast cancer rates among young women during that period -- Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Louisiana, California, Colorado and Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breast cancer rate was 32% higher in the five states with the highest overall rates -- Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Hawaii and Connecticut – than in the five states with the lowest rates, researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idaho, North Dakota, Arizona, Utah and Wyoming had the lowest breast cancer rates, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Western states had the highest rate of increase between 2001 and 2020, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northeast had the highest overall rate among women under 40 and experienced a significant increase over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South was the only region where breast cancer in young women did not increase over the period, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The increase in incidence we are seeing is alarming and cannot be explained by genetic factors alone, which evolve over much longer periods, nor by changes in screening practices, given that women under 40 years are below the recommended age for routine mammography screening,” Kehm said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that doctors might consider location along with other risk factors in assessing a woman’s potential risk for breast cancer, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “may improve our ability to identify groups of younger women at higher risk for early-onset breast cancer,” the team concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer research also might focus on state-specific risk factors for breast cancer, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example could be laws that regulate alcohol consumption, which is an established risk factor for breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White women were the only group to experience a statistically significant increase in early-onset breast cancer rates across all four regions of the U.S., results showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black women had the highest overall rates of early-onset breast cancer across the country, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, whole foods high in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9787832/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;dietary fiber&lt;/a&gt; support the microbiome, while certain &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38388570/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; can have a negative impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that the microbiota — including bacteria, fungi, virus, and other microbes — [that] naturally live in our gut are important for our overall health, immune function, and various health conditions,” &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/li-jiao-23845" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Li Jiao, MD, MS, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor in the Department of Medicine-Gastroenterology at Baylor College of Medicine told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our diet affects our health through the gut microbiota, at least partially. If we fully understand how food impacts the trillions of bacteria in our gut, we can better maintain gut health, overall health, and provide evidence-based dietary guidelines. We would be able to use tailored nutrition approaches to prevent and manage diseases in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiao is the senior author of a new study recently published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/3/567" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, providing evidence that different types of dairy products affect the gut microbiome differently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, Jiao and her team found that drinking more &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/273451" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; was correlated to an increase in two types of bacteria that may support gut health, while consuming more &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/299147" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt; was linked to lower amounts of a third beneficial type of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers’ final analysis included samples from 34 people who had a scheduled colonoscopy between August 2013 and April 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study excluded people with a family history of colon diseases or IBD, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322428" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;colorectal polyps&lt;/a&gt; within the previous 3 years, and those with other conditions or taking medications that could affect the study results. People who had recently changed their eating habits were also excluded from the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants’ provided information on their intake of total dairy, milk, cheese, and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/295714" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt; via a self-reported questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We set out to study dairy products and their impacts on gut bacteria for two main reasons,” Jiao explained. “One, fermented foods are thought to influence gut microbiota. Many dairy products, such as yogurt and cheese, are fermented foods. Two, there is still some debate about whether milk and cheese are good for our health. This study [was] meant to provide more biological evidence about [the] health impacts of milk and cheese.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon analysis, scientists discovered that participants who consumed more total dairy and milk, and those who ate less cheese, appeared to have a higher alpha-microbial diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The variety of species plays a crucial role in maintaining the overall health and stability of the ecosystem,” Jiao explained. “Having higher alpha-diversity in the gut means a healthier and more balanced gut microbiota community.“&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A diverse microbiota is more resilient to external disturbance such as infections, changes in diet, and antibiotic use, allowing for a quicker recovery. It is like a forest with many different types of trees [that] can recover faster from natural disasters,” she detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current research suggests that the &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18871-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;composition of the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, or the abundance of specific types of bacteria present, may be an even better indicator of gut health than alpha-diversity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists observed that participants who ate higher amounts of cheese had a lower amount of the bacterium &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553032/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; in their gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past studies provide conflicting evidence on the health effects of &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt;. Some research suggests this bacterium produces toxins that &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29398651/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;promote tumor formation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; and are associated with &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28151975/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;colorectal cancer development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;. However, low levels of &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt; have also been linked to &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27999802/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;IBD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt; are among the common bacteria in our body and some of their species offer health benefits,” Jiao said. “In the large intestine, &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt; help digest food, absorb nutrients, and promote gut health. We found that middle-aged men [who] consumed higher amounts of cheese had less abundant of these beneficial bacteria in the gut, making higher cheese consumption less helpful in our study population.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Meanwhile, higher consumption of cheese [reduced] was related to a lower diversity of the gut bacteria in our study. However, some species of &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt; can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Therefore, interpreting the results is not straightforward. More research is needed to understand the different strains of &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides &lt;/em&gt;and their roles in the human body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Li Jiao, MD, MS, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiao and her team also observed that those who consumed more total diary and milk had a higher amount of the bacteria &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10410495/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9300896/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in their microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In animal studies, &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; also shows potential in helping prevent chronic conditions like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8161007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11510203/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; are two common bacteria essential for a healthy gut,” Jiao explained. “Both can help regulate the immune system, reduce inflammation, and promote a healthy gut. Akkermansia, in addition, helps maintain and strengthen the gut lining. They are considered beneficial for our health based on the current evidence.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Milk and dairy products may help promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut, supporting the idea that milk is good for our health,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For people who aren’t &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/180120" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;lactose intolerant&lt;/a&gt;, consumption of low-fat dairy products may boost these beneficial bacteria and the diversity of the gut microbiota. Those with lactose intolerance issues may opt for yogurt, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318353" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;kefir&lt;/a&gt;, lactose-free dairy, or dairy alternatives. However, it is important to pay attention to how your body responds to dairy products,” the researcher cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/gastroenterology/ca/santa-monica/rudolph-bedford-1902885684" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Rudolph Bedford, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It makes sense in that the process of &lt;a href="https://www.idfa.org/pasteurization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;pasteurizing&lt;/a&gt; cheese versus what we do with milk are quite different, and there are different potential bacteria that are involved in either both processes or what’s actually left after the process is finished,” Bedford, who was not involved in the study, told us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these recent findings, Bedford said people who have&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;IBD or other gut-related diseases may want to consider drinking more milk and eating less cheese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“But obviously, I think that much more research needs to be done,” he cautioned. “In terms of patients with things like inflammatory bowel disease, we’re encouraging more of a &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324221" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; these days, which does incorporate various dairy-like products, yogurts, and things of that sort.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d like [researchers] to break down the types of cheeses that are actually associated with lowering the &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/em&gt; colonies, and whether or not the processing of the cheeses really has more to do with that than not,” Bedford added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 11:23:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQbVdwSV9CcURIZ1JWNlQwMzE5NDAwdXZZczN1V2xac2JEZXBKcUcwRmZKc2NqdXVjaXo4S20tcGpqa1VZMXZ4eC1IRnlocnFjd1JzVWtDX2VIVGtlOTlnOHc2aDctb1otT1N3aWxBX0dWTWVkVGI2dWp2blRkTUkwd2dwT3U0YVlSWTBTTl9fdGlqUHJXQ2pCOVdiblZwVEVK</guid></item><item><title>Killing 166 million birds hasn't helped poultry farmers stop H5N1.

Three years later, highly pathogenic avian influenza has spread to all 50 states. The number of commercial birds that have died or been killed &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html" target="_blank"&gt;exceeds 166 million&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-06/nearly-9-a-dozen-why-egg-prices-are-skyrocketing-and-for-how-long"&gt;the price of eggs&lt;/a&gt; is at an all-time high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poultry producers, infectious disease experts and government officials now concede that H5N1 is likely here to stay. That recognition is prompting some of them to question whether the long-standing practice of culling every single bird on an infected farm is sustainable over the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, they are discussing such strategies as targeted depopulation, vaccinations, and even the relocation of wetlands and bodies of water to lure virus-carrying wild birds away from poultry farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But each of these alternatives entails a variety of logistical, economic and environmental costs that may eclipse the intended savings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People talk about common-sense solutions to bird flu,” said &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty/maurice-ernest-pitesky" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Maurice Pitesky&lt;/a&gt;, a veterinarian and commercial poultry expert at UC Davis. “But that’s what mass culling is.

And most will blackball a nation’s entire poultry portfolio, even if just one region or type of poultry is infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. exports more than &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/about-the-industry/statistics/u-s-broiler-exports-quantity-and-share-of-production/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;6.7 billion pounds of chicken meat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; each year, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/statistic/broiler-industry-key-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;second only to Brazil&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, according to the National Chicken Council. So as long as foreign buyers are resistant to vaccination, the shots probably won’t be deployed even if egg-laying hens are getting wiped out by the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As members of the U.S. Congressional and Senate Chicken Caucuses &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Letter-to-USDA-Re-HPAI-Vaccine.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;wrote in a letter&lt;/a&gt; this month to the USDA, “if an egg-laying hen in Michigan is vaccinated for HPAI, the U.S. right now would likely be unable to export an unvaccinated broiler chicken from Mississippi.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new H5N2 vaccine might allay such concerns. While it would offer protection against H5N1, it would elicit antibodies that look distinct from the ones that arise from an actual infection, Cardona said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pitesky said that none of these measures will work if we don’t do a better job with flu surveillance and farm placement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wildlife and agriculture officials should ramp up their testing of wild birds to determine where the virus is moving and how it is evolving, he said. That will require global coordination because infected birds can travel back and forth between the U.S., Canada, Russia, East Asia and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poultry farms near ponds, lagoons or wetlands that attract wild birds should be on high alert during migration season, Pitesky said. Farmers should use apps such as &lt;a class="link" href="https://ebird.org/home" target="_blank"&gt;eBird&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://birdcast.info/" target="_blank"&gt;BirdCast &lt;/a&gt;or the &lt;a class="link" href="https://waterfowlalertnetwork.com/tracker/" target="_blank"&gt;Waterfowl Alert Network&lt;/a&gt; to keep tabs on when the birds are nearby so they can step up their biosecurity measures as needed, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be possible to lure wild birds away from agricultural facilities by bolstering wetlands in more remote areas, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I keep pushing the idea of starting to reflood some of those wetlands, but we haven’t done it in any kind of strategic fashion,” Pitesky said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea makes sense, but has been brushed off as “pie in the sky, which I push back on,” he said. “I’m like, what we’re doing right now is obviously not working.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 11:00:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxONnI5Z3V2VDJ6c0pTN3BmM2tuQWIxajg5Rng2R2RNaHBWcHFfdjdweC1Qal9kb1kyRTJNRDBSZXVsVzBQSGpWTk5DUXVmdnBwZy1KOTlYZlVkZ1pza01ydE9NM3NaT3U3LXY2QnMwZURjak04TGhBT1ZmVC1mLTFHdDU2bFZxMUxGQTdVdmNOb0lIdG1qUHp3cU1aMWc</guid></item><item><title>Diagnostic dilemma: Teen's improbable pregnancy occurred after oral sex - Livescience.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxObDdCMUNkbWpyRVZkdEtSQnphejc5Q1pyOGJZNlI0V045UnJlRDI5Tk5LcmFEVVM5T0o0YmZDTkpJbk9wSmo3VWFQdVl0eTJJTE95ejZmN0tyUkh1YTRZSFZYSFdnVzlacGpodzdLVVZRMkh0OGJRY09BczNmU1RoaGVOTk11TW5LV2Y1M2NlMkxydXNJejBOWjkzVEtTd3hwVVR1RHJ0clJHQjJ3YkdtTTVBOWxVSU9YVGo2eWRRNURfcjViV29GbjlB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 15-year-old girl in Lesotho, Southern Africa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;In 1988, a teen visited the hospital with intermittent and acute abdominal pain. An examination revealed that she was about nine months pregnant — but she said she had been unaware of the pregnancy. Her uterus was contracting at regular intervals and the fetus was oriented with its head downward in the birth canal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;When emergency room doctors inspected the patient's vulva, they found no vaginal opening. Instead, there was a skin-covered shallow indentation between her labia minora — the vulva's inner lips — and below her urethral meatus, the external opening of the urethra that transports urine out of the bladder. This rare condition, in which the vaginal opening is absent or closed, is known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9655474/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9655474/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;distal vaginal atresia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and affects an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9655474/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9655474/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;estimated 1 in 4,000 to 10,000&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; newborn females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors gave the patient spinal anaesthesia and performed an emergency cesarean section (C-section), delivering a healthy baby boy weighing 6.2 pounds (2.8 kilograms), according to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3191066/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3191066/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examination of the patient after her delivery revealed that her uterus terminated in a vagina that was just 0.8 inches (2 centimeters) deep, according to the case report. (Vaginal depth is typically 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) but can extend up to 8 inches (20 cm) during arousal.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient had previously visited the same emergency room 278 days, or just over nine months, earlier,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;after a man stabbed her in the upper abdomen. The knife had penetrated her abdominal wall and created two wounds in her stomach. At the time, doctors treated her injuries and discharged her from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months later, as the patient was recovering from the cesarean operation, she told a nurse that the attack occurred when an ex-lover had found her fellating her new boyfriend. The doctors concluded that, after the patient was stabbed, sperm she had swallowed migrated to her reproductive organs through the tears in her digestive tract, thus causing her pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-idrmu5KrtJ8ih32eTtjpK3" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-idrmu5KrtJ8ih32eTtjpK3 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient's recovery was uneventful, and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;she and her boyfriend ultimately accepted the circumstances of the child's conception, the report added. A few years later, the boy visibly resembled his father — the man she had been fellating at the time of the attack — a fact that "excludes an even more miraculous conception," the emergency room physician wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Fertilization typically occurs after sperm is introduced to the female reproductive system through the vagina. Environments that are highly acidic, such as the gastrointestinal tract, are inhospitable to sperm. However, saliva is lower in acid than other parts of the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acidity is measured by the pH scale, which runs from 0 to 14 — the lower the number, the more acid is present. The stomach is acidic, with a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/medical-tests/stomach-acid-test" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/medical-tests/stomach-acid-test" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pH of 1.5 to 3.5&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Saliva typically has a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3800408/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3800408/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pH of 6.7&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on average, which is close to neutral. This could explain why the sperm in this case was still viable after being swallowed, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, when people are malnourished, the digestive system becomes less acidic and more alkaline, the doctor wrote. The patient was underfed at the time of the knifing, which may have provided a more hospitable environment for the swallowed sperm as it traveled from her digestive system and passed through the knife wounds in her stomach to enter her uterus, the doctor theorized in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-idrmu5KrtJ8ih32eTtjpK3-p3R3m1EajKJArbn2NdWNkCgdl1Cuemal" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-idrmu5KrtJ8ih32eTtjpK3-p3R3m1EajKJArbn2NdWNkCgdl1Cuemal slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When it comes to surviving radiation, tardigrades really know their stuff, shrugging off doses that would annihilate most other life forms. Now researchers are using this knowledge to find ways to protect healthy cells during  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="153279" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A team led by Ameya Kirtane from Harvard Medical School and Jianling Bi from the University of Iowa has isolated this superpower in the form of messenger RNA, which when injected into cells protects them from radiation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people undergo radiotherapy for cancer, it's not just the tumor that suffers. The radiation causes DNA breaks in healthy cells, too, leading to massive cell death and inflammation, which is responsible for the treatment's unpleasant side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It can manifest as something as simple as mouth sores, which can limit a person's ability to eat because it's so painful, to requiring hospitalization because people are suffering so terribly from the pain, weight loss, or bleeding," University of Iowa radiation oncologist James Byrne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074707?"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite their cute monikers like moss piglet and water bear, the microscopic, eight-legged animals known as tardigrades are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-adorable-little-animals-will-survive-nearly-any-global-apocalypse"&gt;&lt;span&gt;notoriously tough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Aside from surviving the hottest setting of your oven and pressures of 7.5 Gpa, they can handle &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6770827/"&gt;around a thousand times&lt;/a&gt; the dose of ionizing radiation that would kill a human. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can do this because of their ability to produce a unique protein Dsup (short for 'damage suppressing'), which helps them tolerate both the initial blast and the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-figured-out-how-tardigrades-survive-x-ray-bombardment"&gt;hydroxyl radicals&lt;/a&gt; that form in cells as a result, which would otherwise tear up one or even both strands of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-figured-out-how-tardigrades-survive-x-ray-bombardment"&gt;had their eyes on this protein&lt;/a&gt; as a potential aid to cancer treatment since &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12808"&gt;it was discovered in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and now they're one step closer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q-3uNVu6sqk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That 2016 study showed that when expressed in human cells, Dsup reduces X-ray-induced DNA damage by about 40 percent, which is why the researchers are hopeful it could protect cancer patients from the serious side-effects of their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Dsup has to be inside a cell's nucleus to work. Delivering this protein directly into each cell is not feasible, and integrating the genes for Dsup directly into DNA has its own risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of the strengths of our approach is that we are using a messenger RNA, which just temporarily expresses the protein, so it's considered far safer than something like DNA, which may be incorporated into the cells' genome," Kirtane &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074707?"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By wrapping the mRNA in specific polymer-lipid nanoparticles (one design best-suited to the colon, and one ideal for the mouth) they were able to smuggle the strands into lab-grown cells where they were used to generate large amounts of Dsup before disintegrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We thought that perhaps by combining these two systems – polymers and lipids – we may be able to get the best of both worlds and get highly potent RNA delivery. And that's essentially what we saw," Kirtane &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074707?"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, delivering the Dsup in mRNA 'recipe' format also prevents the protective tardigrade armor from sneaking their way into cells the radiation is supposed to kill, such as those making up the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure this works in action, the team injected Dsup-encoding mRNA into mice who, 6 hours later, received a dose of radiation roughly equivalent to one that might be administered to a human cancer patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group of mice received mRNA treatment and radiation to the mouth; the other, to the rectum. And some extra mice were given the radiation without the protection of Dsup, to provide a baseline for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153378" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153378" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-153378" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation.png 1992w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation-642x267.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation-998x415.png 998w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation-768x319.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation-1536x638.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation-600x249.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1992px) 100vw, 1992px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153378" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;It's still a long way off human use, but the delivery of tardigrade Dsup protein mRNA shows promise. (Kirtane et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 'rectal' group experienced about half as many radiation-induced double-stranded DNA breaks, compared with controls that did not receive Dsup protection. The 'mouth' group had about one third of the breaks of their peers. And the mRNA treatment seemed to have no effect on tumor volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research is just the beginning: the sample sizes were very small, and of course, we can't predict how human bodies will react to a treatment based solely on tests on lab-grown cells or mice. But it's enough to prompt further investigation, especially now they know they can get the mRNA safely into a cell without conferring the benefit on the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The use of Dsup mRNA delivery may be co-opted for several other clinical applications, including protection of normal tissue from DNA-damaging chemotherapies or progressive degeneration of specific tissues, cancer predisposition, chromosomal instability and hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents," the authors &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01360-5"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In addition to cancer-related applications, the use of Dsup protein can be extended to total body exposure to space radiation or as prophylaxis against nuclear radiation exposure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01360-5"&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Akiko Iwasaki, the lead researcher behind the paper, told DailyMail.com she understands the pre-print, which was not peer-reviewed but published on website MedRxiv, could be seen as controversial &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain fog is a term used to describe a range of cognitive problems that impact on daily life, such as memory difficulties, problems finding the right words and feeling overwhelmed by simple everyday tasks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tinnitus, meanwhile, is a hearing problem that most commonly takes the form of persistent ringing in the ears, but can also sound like buzzing, roaring, hissing, or clicking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When such sounds last more than six months, it's known as chronic tinnitus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Insomnia is a sleep disorder that sees sufferers have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting good quality sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC and NHS recommend adults get between seven and nine hours of sleep on average, and people who don't get this amount regularly could have insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Persistent sleep deprivation can take a toll on people's health from irritability and reduced focus in the short term, to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-e4b36540-d983-11ef-bf36-47316f776e33" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Yale scientists also found PVS patients could see a dormant virus in their body called Epstein-Barr reawaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than nine in 10 adults have had Epstein-Barr at some point in their lives, with it being a common infection spread through bodily fluids like saliva or semen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2022 study led by academics at Imperial College London suggests almost 20million lives were saved by Covid vaccines in the first year since countries began rolling out the jabs, the majority in wealthy nations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes symptoms like fatigue, fever, and rashes, and once symptoms disappear, the virus remains dormant in the body, where it can be reactivated when the immune system is low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, the Yale team collected blood samples of 42 Americans with PVS and 22 without it, between December 2022 and November 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with the syndrome were generally in poorer health than the average American, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most complaining of the symptoms developed them after their first or second Covid vaccine, with some experiencing an onset after a third or fourth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with PVS also had elevated levels of Covid spike proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The levels in PVS patients were even greater than those found in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14255465/doctors-relief-long-covid-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;patients with long Covid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a condition with similar symptoms linked to the virus itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Persistent spike proteins in the body are thought to cause some of long Covid's symptoms, by keeping the body in a constant state of inflammation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Akiko Iwasaki, the lead researcher behind the paper, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14421799/yale-scientists-covid-vaccine-study-message-victims.html"&gt;told DailyMail.com&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;People with PVS also had elevated levels of Covid spike proteins.

We need funding to carry out such future work.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Independent experts, however, have urged for caution over the findings.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr John Wherry, director of the Institute for Immunology at the University of Pennsylvania, said it's possible some of the excess spike protein identified in the study may be from undetected Covid infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/health/covid-post-vaccination-syndrome.html"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;: 'I would like to see more data on this topic.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/awgaffney/status/1892935347136278841"&gt;on X&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Adam Gaffney, an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Harvard University, also said: 'There's nothing wrong with studying vaccine side effects. There is a problem with this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're at a moment right now where the US government is undercutting people's trust in science and vaccinations probably like never before in history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And to coin this novel syndrome without even proving that it's caused by the vaccine is very worrisome to me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mRNA Covid vaccines are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;estimated to have saved tens of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10944873/Covid-vaccines-saved-nearly-20MILLION-lives-year-worlds-roll-out.html"&gt;millions of lives globally from Covid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;1.6million in Europe and 3million in the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They are also credited with helping end the series of paralyzing lockdowns brought on by the Covid pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC still recommends Covid vaccines, especially for those who are elderly or immunocompromised and vulnerable to the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid is also still &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-8239461/Confirmed-coronavirus-cases-surpass-800-000-death-toll-hits-42-940.html" class=""&gt;killing about 300 Americans every week&lt;/a&gt;, CDC data shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid vaccines are not currently available in the UK via the NHS, though they are expected to roll out again in the spring.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn't the first mRNA jabs have been linked to worrying side effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Global reports of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12339279/Covid-vaccine-myocarditis-heart-Elon-Musk-bronny-james.html"&gt;myocarditis&lt;/a&gt;, a potentially dangerous inflammation of the heart muscle, have also spooked health officials in the US and UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In myocarditis, it's thought that the immune system may register mRNA in Covid vaccines as a threat, leading the immune system to attack itself and cause inflammation of the myocardium, the heart's muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This same mechanism has been linked to pericarditis, which leads to inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both conditions have been linked to viruses like the common cold and hepatitis, as well as Covid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most cases are mild, in rare instances, myocarditis can damage the heart and make it difficult for it to pump blood, eventually leading to heart failure, heart attack, and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have found rates of myocarditis in Britain were eventually found to be lower than in the US and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some experts attributed this to the UK's longer intervals between doses, eight weeks compared to four, which is said to give the body more time to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, the &lt;span&gt;side effect is rare but exactly how rare is still being debated. Estimates range from one in 50,000 to one in 200,000. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data also showed that the risk of myocarditis from Covid itself was far higher than that from a vaccine, so experts continued to recommend the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no figures for the number of PVS patients in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Trevor Keyler, a biology professor in Minnesota, was an avid mountain biker when he developed cataracts and tremors after his Moderna vaccine. He is pictured with his two children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lindy Ayers, 31, was a military veteran, triathlete, and skateboarding competitor before she was left wheelchair bound after her Covid shot. She is pictured at left before the injury and at right after&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, government data has recorded the number of people applying for compensation for injuries and deaths they believe to be caused by the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest figures, published by Parliament last month, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14416803/covid-vaccine-injury-risk-harm-killed-Brits-new-syndrome.html"&gt;show a total of 17,379&lt;/a&gt; applications had been made to the UK's Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme as of November last year, with at least 70 of these related to deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, just 194 have been deemed eligible for payment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The controversial scheme predates the Covid shots and offers some victims of vaccine injuries and deaths a one-off payment of £120,000 (about $150,000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the 9,196 rejected claims, 416 were done so on the grounds that, while a victim had been injured by a vaccine, they didn't meet the 60 percent disability threshold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a further 7,173 victims, or their families, are still awaiting a verdict, meaning the totals could still rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, data from the US Covid vaccine injury compensation program suggested that 14,000 people had filed claims for injury or death they claimed were caused by the vaccine as of December 2024, out of the 270million Americans who received at least one dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But only one in four claims have been reviewed, according to the Health Resources &amp;amp; Services Administration, an agency within the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those reviewed, 58 are 'eligible for compensation.' In order to be eligible, a person must be able to prove their injury was directly caused by a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But that's not the only bad news. Scientists have also detected bird flu in three veterinarians working with cattle, which may signal a change in the way the virus is spreading.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the university, three veterinarians working with cattle have tested positive for bird flu without presenting any symptoms. In a separate statement, the &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/news/study-three-bovine-veterinarians-unknowingly-infected-h5n1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;American Veterinary Medical Association said&lt;/a&gt; a study found that "Among 150 practitioners tested, three had evidence of recent infection with H5N1, including two who hadn’t been exposed to animals confirmed or suspected to have H5N1 infections." One of those infected vets didn't even practice in a state with a confirmed H5N1 case. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sarah Michaels, an infectious disease expert at Tulane University’s Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, says this study and others could indicate that the virus is far more widespread than we thought. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It will be difficult to contain,” Michaels said. “Recent screenings and the national milk testing program have shown that bird flu has spilled over from wild birds to cattle more than once. And this report of infections in three veterinarians highlights the importance of rapidly identifying infected dairy cattle, continued testing of bulk milk, and monitoring human infections among those at increased risk.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As for the new strain, it's known as the D1.1 variant, which Tulane explained had only been previously found in wild birds and some domestic poultry. However, now, it's not only been found in cattle but also in a Nevada dairy worker, marking the third known human case involving the variant. This follows two other high-profile cases with D1.1, including the death of a Louisiana farmer who contracted it from his backyard flock and a teenager in Canada who was hospitalized but later recovered. And now that that are two types of the virus out there, experts say it will be hard to both track and contain the spread. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s endemic in cows now. There is no way this is going to get contained,” Seema Lakdawala, an influenza virologist and co-director of the Center for Transmission of Airborne Pathogens at Emory School of Medicine, shared with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/22/bird-flu-virus-trump" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding fuel to the fire is the absolutely rampant spread of the flu in humans this winter. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-07.html#:~:text=CDC%20estimates%20that%20there%20have,flu%20so%20far%20this%20season." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) reported that there have been "at least 33 million illnesses, 430,000 hospitalizations, and 19,000 deaths from flu so far this season," marking one of the worst flu seasons in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/usmap.html" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;over a decade&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “There’s a lot of flu going around, and so the potential for the virus to reassort right now is high,” Lakdawala additionally told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, noting there is the possibility of "reassortment" in animals.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While all this is really great, things could be worse than we know, as the Trump administration has halted communication with the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/29/nx-s1-5276340/trump-centers-for-disease-control-cdc-world-health-organization" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, which is no longer receiving updates on either human flu or avian influenza.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “There’s no way Americans can protect themselves from bird flu unless the Trump administration stops recklessly withholding the latest information on where and how it’s spreading,” Hannah Connor, deputy environmental health director at the Center for Biological Diversity, &lt;a href="https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/cdc-urged-to-release-bird-flu-data-as-trump-slashes-key-staff-combatting-outbreak-2025-02-24/#:~:text=Under%20Trump%20the%20CDC%20has,Morbidity%20and%20Mortality%20Weekly%20Report." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;shared in a letter co-signed by 28 public interest groups&lt;/a&gt;. “The most effective way to slow an outbreak of this magnitude is to routinely keep us all well informed.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As for what you can do to protect yourself, Michaels noted that “Eggs and meat should be cooked thoroughly, and people should refrain from drinking raw milk." Emily Landon, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Chicago Medicine, echoed this sentiment in her own university's statement, noting that while the risk to humans remains is low, it's still important to stay vigilant. “The highest risk to most people would be through contaminated dairy products,” Landon noted. So, for now, it's best to avoid raw milk and unpasteurized cheese. This also goes for your pets. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As always, you should avoid contact with infected animals and wash your hands frequently if you do come in contact with any farm animals.

But that's not the only bad news. Scientists have also detected bird flu in three veterinarians working with cattle, which may signal a change in the way the virus is spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the university, three veterinarians working with cattle have tested positive for bird flu without presenting any symptoms. In a separate statement, the &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/news/study-three-bovine-veterinarians-unknowingly-infected-h5n1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Veterinary Medical Association said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Veterinary Medical Association said&lt;/a&gt; a study found that "Among 150 practitioners tested, three had evidence of recent infection with H5N1, including two who hadn’t been exposed to animals confirmed or suspected to have H5N1 infections." One of those infected vets didn't even practice in a state with a confirmed H5N1 case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sarah Michaels, an infectious disease expert at Tulane University’s Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, says this study and others could indicate that the virus is far more widespread than we thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/is-it-safe-to-eat-eggs-bird-flu-8786608" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Is It Safe to Eat Eggs During a Bird Flu Outbreak?

Here’s What to Know&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It will be difficult to contain,” Michaels said. “Recent screenings and the national milk testing program have shown that bird flu has spilled over from wild birds to cattle more than once. And this report of infections in three veterinarians highlights the importance of rapidly identifying infected dairy cattle, continued testing of bulk milk, and monitoring human infections among those at increased risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As for the new strain, it's known as the D1.1 variant, which Tulane explained had only been previously found in wild birds and some domestic poultry. However, now, it's not only been found in cattle but also in a Nevada dairy worker, marking the third known human case involving the variant. This follows two other high-profile cases with D1.1, including the death of a Louisiana farmer who contracted it from his backyard flock and a teenager in Canada who was hospitalized but later recovered. And now that that are two types of the virus out there, experts say it will be hard to both track and contain the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s endemic in cows now. There is no way this is going to get contained,” Seema Lakdawala, an influenza virologist and co-director of the Center for Transmission of Airborne Pathogens at Emory School of Medicine, shared with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/22/bird-flu-virus-trump" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Guardian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Adding fuel to the fire is the absolutely rampant spread of the flu in humans this winter. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-07.html#:~:text=CDC%20estimates%20that%20there%20have,flu%20so%20far%20this%20season." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) reported that there have been "at least 33 million illnesses, 430,000 hospitalizations, and 19,000 deaths from flu so far this season," marking one of the worst flu seasons in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/usmap.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:over a decade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;over a decade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There’s a lot of flu going around, and so the potential for the virus to reassort right now is high,” Lakdawala additionally told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, noting there is the possibility of "reassortment" in animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While all this is really great, things could be worse than we know, as the Trump administration has halted communication with the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/29/nx-s1-5276340/trump-centers-for-disease-control-cdc-world-health-organization" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, which is no longer receiving updates on either human flu or avian influenza.

The Trump administration’s withholding of those details puts us at the mercy of the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As for what you can do to protect yourself, Michaels noted that “Eggs and meat should be cooked thoroughly, and people should refrain from drinking raw milk." Emily Landon, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Chicago Medicine, echoed this sentiment in her own university's statement, noting that while the risk to humans remains is low, it's still important to stay vigilant. “The highest risk to most people would be through contaminated dairy products,” Landon noted. So, for now, it's best to avoid raw milk and unpasteurized cheese. This also goes for your pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As always, you should avoid contact with infected animals and wash your hands frequently if you do come in contact with any farm animals.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Sue Bell became one of the first Alzheimer's patients in the U.S. to receive the drug now marketed as Leqembi.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Four years later, she and her husband, Ken, halted the treatment. Sue's Alzheimer's had reached the point where her taking the drug no longer made sense.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it helped," says her husband, Ken Bell. "But I'm not sure."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That sort of uncertainty is common when it comes to&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-alzheimers-disease-treatment" target="_blank"&gt; Leqembi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-approves-treatment-adults-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank"&gt;Kisunla&lt;/a&gt;, two new Alzheimer's drugs approved since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both drugs clear the brain of a substance called beta-amyloid, which forms the sticky plaques associated with Alzheimer's. Studies show they can slow down the underlying disease process that ultimately leads to the death of brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But neither drug restores memory and cognition, and the benefit to a given person varies widely.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Some people progress, other people do pretty well," says&lt;a href="https://physicians.wustl.edu/people/barbara-joy-snider-md-phd/" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Joy Snider&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of neurology and one of Sue's doctors at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both drugs also cost more than $25,000 a year, and can cause brain swelling and bleeding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A diagnosis and a drug&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sue began having memory problems around 2019, when she was working as a substitute teacher.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She'd come home and she'd say, I'm having trouble spelling words and things like that," Ken told me when I visited the couple in 2023 at their home in St. Charles, Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I didn't remember all that," Sue added. "That's part of the problem."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sue saw her primary care doctor, then a neurologist. She got cognitive tests, brain scans, and, eventually, a diagnosis: early stage Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Sue volunteered for a study at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Researchers there were conducting part of a nationwide clinical trial of Leqembi, then known by its generic name, lecanemab.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The drug was the latest in a series of medications designed to clear the brain of beta-amyloid, which forms the sticky plaques that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's. At the time, none of those drugs had been shown to slow the loss of memory and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So Sue and Ken knew lecanemab was unlikely to help her.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm the kind of person that I would like to help somebody else, too." Sue said during my 2023 visit. "And that's what I was in this for."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ken hoped that if lecanemab worked even a little, "at some point maybe they would come up with something that would either reverse the symptoms or cure it even."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infusions and hope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sue and Ken began making twice-monthly trips to St. Louis, about 30 minutes away, where she got lecanemab by intravenous infusion.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Needles don't bother me," she said, adding that she didn't experience the brain swelling or bleeding that can be side effects of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first, the drug seemed to help. Sue was able to take a trip to New York.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was a great trip. We had five girls," Sue said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was really six girls," Ken added softly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Oh I forgot that," Sue said. "It was very fun. We just walked all over the place."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved lecanemab/Leqembi for treating people in the earliest stage of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By then, though, Sue knew her memory was getting worse, despite the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Oh, it's waning," she said at the time. "Some days I'm better than others."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even so, Ken and Sue kept driving from St. Charles to St. Louis for her lecanemab infusions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-49460" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ending treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In late 2024, I got an update during a video call with Ken — but not Sue.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I didn't think it would help to have her participate today, honestly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tests had shown that Sue's memory and thinking had declined to the point where lecanemab was no longer a good option.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We decided that we were kind of wasting our time coming down there all the time," Ken said. "So we suspended taking the drugs."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So have many other patients in the clinical trial of lecanemab, says Snider, the Washington University neurologist who oversaw Sue's treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have a few people left from that study who are still on the medication," She says. "I am surprised at how well some of them are doing."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For all of its limitations, Snider says, Leqembi represents a meaningful change in Alzheimer's treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"People like Sue and Ken are the reason we have a new drug, and the reason we can give hope to a lot of people with this disease," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Sue, though, hope is fading.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She still knows me, still knows our kids," Ken says. But some days, he adds, she gets lost in her own house.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On one of those days, Sue began asking Ken to move her to a care home. So Ken found one she liked.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"After she was there a few days, every time I would come she would say take me back home, I don't want to be here anymore," Ken says. "After a month, I brought her back home."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sue is still at home, when she's not at a daycare for people with memory problems. Two days a week, Ken gets help from in-home care providers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But at some point, Ken says, his wife will probably need more care than he can arrange at home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But much of the current research &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25233067/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that there is no clear evidence of harm — and those findings have been emphasized by the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers/causes-and-risk-factors"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/antiperspirants-and-breast-cancer-risk.html"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/antiperspirants"&gt;National Kidney Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VYBQOW3HL5HPDEPTY64ND2YEE4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Because of certain concerns about antiperspirants and kidney disease, however, the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates antiperspirants, requires that they carry &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/omuf/OTC%20Monograph_M019-Antiperspirant%20Drug%20Products%20for%20OTC%20Human%20Use%2011.23.2021.pdf"&gt;a label reading&lt;/a&gt;, “Ask a doctor before use if you have kidney disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ID5L2TP7XBH6TE62SP3JIN2DNA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Friedman and other dermatologists said they have noticed a shift among patients toward aluminum-free antiperspirants, many of which claim to be free of parabens and phthalates, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RVI5NONYYZCSBFAOYGWD67M4EQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Deodorants marketed as natural are not as effective as antiperspirants at reducing excessive sweat and may incorporate ingredients such as fragrances and essential oils that may cause irritation or “allergic contact dermatitis, so it is important to be cautious especially if you have sensitive skin,” said &lt;a href="https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md"&gt;Marisa Garshick&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatologist and a clinical &lt;a href="https://directory.weill.cornell.edu/person/profile/mak9138"&gt;assistant professor&lt;/a&gt; of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QXQ5JDUOJZDU7O6THOLKKQ622E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another approach involves targeting the odor-causing skin bacteria so there is less of them to break down the sweat. Some people on social media have opted for antibacterial washes containing &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drdrayzday/video/7365302287595670830?lang=en&amp;amp;q=chlorhexidine%20armpit&amp;amp;t=1740378610036"&gt;benzoyl peroxide or chlorhexidine&lt;/a&gt;, products with glycolic acid or straight &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kylimomma/video/7297412946722934059?lang=en&amp;amp;q=alcohol%20armpit&amp;amp;t=1740379242531"&gt;isopropyl alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, all of which “can help with odor, but will not block sweat. They can also be irritating to the skin,” said &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/slipner"&gt;Shari Lipner&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of clinical dermatology at Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="CWRKNFOCIZB4HGLX2IPOJAY2ME" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="CWRKNFOCIZB4HGLX2IPOJAY2ME"&gt;What else you should know:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WRGGCFSM25FZFONVQPLHRZJZXY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Choosing a deodorant, antiperspirant or alternative method for underarm odor control is a personal decision, but here are some shopping suggestions from dermatologists:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="W4W2EUQ56BGJNJEAPHJ2YJIXKM" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Determine what type you need.&lt;/b&gt; Deodorants control body odor, and antiperspirants reduce sweating, which then helps to cut down on body odor. Many products include both. “I generally recommend a combined antiperspirant deodorant in a stick format,” Lipner said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decide which formulation works best for you&lt;/b&gt;. Sticks provide controlled application and more complete coverage, as do gels and roll-ons, though the latter two often go on wet and need several seconds to dry. Sprays are quick, easy and absorb well, but Garshick noted that some people do not want “to breathe in the aerosol spray” during the application.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consider any allergies or sensitivities&lt;/b&gt;. People who have sensitive skin may opt for deodorant products without potential irritants such as alcohol, fragrances or certain preservatives, Friedman said. While he does not consider them effective, aluminum-free options with more plant-based ingredients are available, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WHSNCRRPM5B57DLG234SAY42SM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have concerns, such as  allergies to certain ingredients, speak with a dermatologist about which product or method would work best for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="JTHETOIHXZCZPCVHHMTWVX3UE4" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="JTHETOIHXZCZPCVHHMTWVX3UE4"&gt;The bottom line:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BCOZBPMNCFEDZJPHISOREZWKEQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Antiperspirants, in particular, should be applied at bedtime. When applied at night when sweat production is decreased, the aluminum-based compounds in antiperspirants are better able to plug the sweat ducts to reduce perspiration the next day.

&lt;p&gt;Eighty-four members of Congress have written to President Trump expressing concerns about his actions regarding the CDC and USDA that will negatively impact the nation’s ability to ensure that bird flu does not become widespread among people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;United States Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-CT, leads the 83 other lawmakers in the effort to change the president’s mind about measures he has taken that they believe will hamper the U.S. Department of Agruculture’s and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s efforts in containing bird flu, also known as H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus has already infected 70 people and killed one. More than 970 dairy herds in the United States have been infected and the virus has resulted in the culling of more than 157 million commercial poultry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since becoming president, Trump has restricted communication between the CDC and the USDA, making it impossible for the agencies to collaborate on the nation’s response to bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The most effective way to cut through agency bureaucracy, which you claim to be in favor of, would be to increase agency communication with Congress, stakeholders, and the public,” the lawmakers’ letter states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus has already mutated, with a second strain infecting a dairy herd in Nevada. So far, human H5N1 infections have largely led to mild illnesses, according to the lawmakers, however the two cases of severe illness in North America were associated with this new variant, including a Louisiana resident who died, and a British Columbia teen who was in critical condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Failure to restore full interagency information sharing and public health communications continues to harm the U.S. Response to H5N1,” according to the members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a statement about the lawmakers’ letter to the president, DeLauro said the gag order has harmed the response to prevent the spread of H5N1, and the government must be allowed to resume interagency communications and the sharing of critical public health information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Your Administration must act quickly to address this crisis,” the lawmakers wrote. “Viruses will not wait for this Administration to lift its gag order or for agencies to restart their collaboration and information sharing before they spread or mutate. It is clear that these interfering short-sighted actions by your Administration will cause significant harm. This interference must end.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know you would not like to see another deadly pandemic unfold under your watch. [T]hus, we await your swift action to completely lift the pause on external communications by public health agencies, commit to cross-agency collaboration on H5N1, and work to get every necessary state enrolled in the National Milk Testing Strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last week, the USDA confirmed that it fired several agency employees working on the federal response to H5N1. The Administration “prioritizing” their bird flu response and firing of federal employees actively working on this worsening outbreak cannot both coexist, according to the lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The members of Congress also asked President Trump to encourage all states to engage in the National Milk Testing Strategy (NMTS) to facilitate comprehensive H5N1 detection in the nation’s milk supply. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to sending their letter to President Trump, the lawmakers copied Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins. &lt;/p&gt;

She watched patients die alone and missed her son's birthday out of fear of becoming infected and bringing the virus home with her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January 2021, Covid vaccines became available and, feeling a sense of duty to protect her patients, she took the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pfizer/index.html" id="mol-cdcb3010-f3aa-11ef-8125-0bb3f6a87bc2"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She experienced no immediate side effects, but in July 2021, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14418267/Vaccine-victims-left-disabled-taking-Covid-jab-react-bombshell-Yale-study-shots-cause-extreme-body-changes.html"&gt;Mrs Burnette developed 'unbearable' pain&lt;/a&gt; in both of her hips. She was told she had arthritis at 31 years old and had to use a wheelchair when the pain made it too hard to walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Believing her pain was something else, another doctor ordered an MRI, which revealed Mrs Burnette's hip bones were literally rotting, and she underwent her first hip replacement in December 2021. The second followed a few months later in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, her hips were just the beginning. Over the next nearly four years - and still ongoing today - Mrs Burnette would undergo surgeries on both shoulders and knees, three surgeries on her elbow, one on her left foot and she is scheduled to have another procedure on her right foot next week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About a year after her ordeal began, one of her doctors attributed her complications to her bout of Covid in late November 2020 and subsequent vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brittany Burnette lives in Tennessee with her husband and two sons (pictured here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Burnette told DailyMail.com: 'The pain is so debilitating. I have never felt so helpless in my entire life. I've always been trying to be the best provider I could be caring for other people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, due to Mrs Burnette's condition, she had to quit her job as a nurse and director in an elder care home and go on disability.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continued: 'Now I can't even drive my kids to school in the morning anymore... it's devastating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have really had to mourn the life that I thought I was going to have because I will no longer be able to be the same person I've always wanted to be because of a virus and a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Burnette, now 34, used to be a nurse and director in a nursing home but has had to go on disability because of her medical complications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's absolutely destroyed my life, and so I've had to just totally sit back and reevaluate everything.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like thousands of Americans who suffered injuries shortly after getting their Covid vaccine, Mrs Burnette attributes her ailments to the shot. But a lack of research and evidence has left vaccine victims without answers, lacking support and being cast as anti-vaxxers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, last week, a small Yale University study offered some support to victims' stories as experts discovered a previously-unknown condition - dubbed 'post-vaccination syndrome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include brain fog, dizziness, tinnitus and exercise intolerance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition also appears to reawaken a dormant virus in the body called Epstein-Barr, which can cause flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph nodes and nerve issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Mrs Burnette's symptoms don't match all of those mentioned in the research - she has experienced nerve complications - the researchers said vaccine injuries can manifest differently from patient to patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Burnette told DailyMail.com she remains a supporter of vaccines and she and her children have all received routine shots, but she is hesitant to get new ones going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the hardest things about her complications is the impact it has on her as a mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Burnette's pain is so severe she is often reliant on a wheelchair to get around&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'I worry every day that I'm going to cause [my sons] to have stress and anxiety when they're older but they have made me feel so strong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I feel like, if anything, this just made them so much more compassionate. They are always always there no matter what, at my back to take care of me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My 10 year old has really stepped up and my husband, he works very hard for us, especially with me losing [my job]. He's really been an amazing caretaker and taken over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just don't know if I would have made it. They are the reason I keep going.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to her vaccine, Mrs Burnette had been living with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - thickening of the heart muscle - but her condition was well managed under the care of a cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her new symptoms began, she has seen doctors across multiple specialties, including orthopedics and a geneticist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website her geneticist attributes her complications to a combination of her Covid infection and the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor, Mrs Burnette said, told her when she received the vaccine it prompted an immune response and her body sent out thousands of clots that cut off the blood supply to her bones and joints and cause them to collapse and die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of Mrs Burnette's other doctors believe she has the autoimmune diseases either lupus or rheumatoid arthritis but diagnostic tests have come back negative or inconclusive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Burnette has undergone three surgeries on her elbow to remove dead bone and repair a nerve (left) and has had both of her knees replaced (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has been diagnosed with multifocal avascular necrosis (AVN), also called multifocal osteonecrosis (MFON). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AVN is a condition in which bones throughout the body lose their blood supply, causing them to die. It can be caused by trauma to the body, like broken or fractured bones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://journals.lww.com/annals-of-medicine-and-surgery/fulltext/2023/09000/avascular_necrosis_of_femoral_head_following.5.aspx"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;in the journal Annals of Medicine and Surgery investigated the relationship of avascular necrosis (AVN) and Covid infection in 17 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found 82 percent of patients complained of pain in both hips, leading nearly 18 percent to undergo total hip replacements and they concluded 'there is a risk of developing AVN after Covid-19.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no published research on the connection between AVN and Covid vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Brandson Crawford, a functional neurologist who is not involved in Mrs Burnette's care, told DailyMail.com AVN can be triggered by inflammation and blood clotting abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These, Dr Crawford said, have been documented both in severe Covid cases and post-vaccination adverse reactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'Given that Covid-19 is known to affect the vascular system and trigger inflammatory responses, it is plausible that a vaccine administered soon after an infection could further exacerbate these effects, particularly in individuals with underlying predispositions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Burnette is pictured above receiving her Covid vaccine in January 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her hip replacements, Mrs Burnette has also undergone a partial left shoulder replacement in September 2022 and had three surgeries on her elbow to remove dead bone and repair a nerve in January 2023, August 2024 and November 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She underwent a right knee replacement in August 2023, a partial right shoulder replacement in May 2023, a left knee replacement in February 2023 and in July 2023 her left heel broke and had to be surgically repaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Burnette will undergo surgery in the next few weeks to repair another fracture in her right foot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'Even though I have had all of these replacements and surgeries I am still in constant deep bone pain every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It isn't as bad as bone death pain but some days are still unbearable. The pain is so bad some days it takes everything I have to get out of bed and move, let alone be a mother and wife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Doctors] think I will likely suffer with bone pain for the rest of my life.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not only has she had to cope with AVN, her doctors said the infection and vaccine triggered a 'domino effect' in her body, leading to blood clots in her lungs, declining kidney function, sepsis and pleurisy - inflammation of the lining in the lungs and chest cavity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Above is an x-ray showing Mrs Burnette's double hip replacements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In an alternative effort to treat her ailments, doctors have prescribed chemotherapy and immunotherapy infusions &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'I'm not going to tell you I haven't had dark, scary days and struggle, because I have... without my family and God, I just don't know. That's just what kept me going.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Mrs Burnette believes in vaccines, when she first started speaking out about her experience with the Covid shot, she said she was met with people questioning whether she was an anti-vaxxer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Mrs Burnette has always been pro-vaccine and she and her children received all the recommended shots. Now, however, she is extremely wary of new ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website she will never get or give her children another Covid vaccine, but has no problem getting them routine vaccinations of shots that have been around and researched for decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Burnette said: 'I did everything that I needed to do, vaccinating my children. I was vaccinated, but, I will never get another flu shot or COVID vaccine, and I won't give my kids either as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They will get... the other ones that have been well studied and researched, and there's lots of information on over the years. I just think that newer vaccines, before mandated, need to be researched because these are people's lives that it's destroying.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 03:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPUlV0ZUFzQzJmaEpZd0MybVdUSURmSXM2WTBHNDRSZnVBaENTbmdKbkd6Wkh0cU5ESnVYOXdhZThpLVEtTll5MFpTMXNqZ3luT2tKSlM2N0FNZ3ZLSUxiVmVZMjg0RnQ5WWNpOGFzWmJGYndWUHJ5UFdmbmZiODVEeG13Vmp1cHpobUo4MkhDb1VBVThoMjViclZxX3g4TmdJaG9xRW14WFk5M3ROZXfSAbMBQVVfeXFMUE52X1BRTDdUSGpFZ3JMbGNDVnlhSTZ4NHNPMWlDc2lDVGdSUV9MUy1EMmc1bmFMN3lvMGVNMVJUV3p2dWJ1UFFPb0NYT3pkTG1fYmYyazdha01IejB6M0RDMGoxbEZuQnNnZnc0ZFdDNko0QUR0VHNDV2xwMnAzQzJzblFYS2taSmlFYlV5ejBuZXd5SDVFMVVjRC13WXNIUnA4RkhuTWNJWDRkMWZCNWN2NlU</guid></item><item><title>Over 50 deaths linked to 'unknown disease' in Congo - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNYWE0MTE3eHpyOG8ybGtNYVNkb1R3ZnpDT0ZQWEdSbEhfY24tMkE4UDFnVmI3U3AwNDdLNlNTOEJqVzJ3cUtMNmFwNW8tVGNnbFRnNkgtWDVmdVJRd05IeG5HbThHbUJNeTVldWxXZWdDVGhJVXlZX2JpMk52ZFFncW5JWGV6Tkw0dnZF0gGQAUFVX3lxTE1TM2VsTm5fV2FMLUVFRmVCQ1pNQm1icU9uYVptSDZrNXVKSGRPVmNQNkRzS3drZEVBbWxrSEZLaF9GZXE5Q21CcVZRZW1FV3ZPbmNBNnA3RHJYMW1QelAxcW5xMkFJT3pvSmNJTFVRREdnVTlkTXp0S0NQek9KZUV2RnJpWVMxMGM0N0s2T3Jpag?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;The World Health Organization has reported that there is a deadly "unknown disease" spreading in one region within the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Local health officials in Congo are partnering with the World Health Organization to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;A general view of the World Health Organization (WHO) on April 28, 2009, in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Harold Cunningham/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The phrase "unknown disease" primarily means that the disease has not yet been identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In previous cases, the cases are linked to a known disease, but a lack of available testing leads to lack of certainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For example, there was a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/undiagnosed-disease-congo-linked-malaria-africa-cdc/story?id=116939557" target="_blank"&gt;separate report&lt;/a&gt;

Patients have had fevers up to 104 degrees, coughing, runny nose and red, irritated eyes. After that, they develop a rash that starts near the scalp and spreads down the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms may not appear until two weeks after a person is exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s up to health officials now to do what’s called contact tracing. That means painstakingly tracking down anyone who was in those public spaces at the same time — or several hours afterward — to tell them about the exposure and give guidance on what they should do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That’s on top of the ongoing investigations in the outbreak’s epicenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“My biggest concern right now is the manpower needed to do all of the contact tracing,” said Dr. Ronald Cook, chief health officer at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock and health authority for the city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We’re managing right now, but if this grows any bigger, we’re going to need some more help.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 23:06:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPc0NWOEN0QjVQQ01FVkFfQ0dIR2UxVXN1SWdEUDlmSnZDU00xRkkzNWNzb0lRWWVQTXpELXdfN251aXc5SGxoZHhFWHpDV05EYzU5S1ZkTm1ITlZWM3V2ZGMxT240alpielVYaXgxaHNMcWY5Zi05SWtxcnR3aDk5d3RLR29lVzE2X0lJVGllY1pzRnI2NlMzc2hIVDI3S2hYVUHSAVZBVV95cUxNYlFxYnpDNktob1pQbzJSV2FIZFRoenN6MnJISDR0TXNHdlRSQlFFcDlUbVY5dmJ4MkM1Q2pqXzY4aE9UaUpwd2NsY0d6N09aMlRFazQ1Zw</guid></item><item><title>Brain surgery took all my childhood memories - will i forget my fiance after second op? - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTFAyRXZ6dUl4eDFraUFtMXlIRGNrMkdlTGVRRlBwenJndkxON0tDV1cwQmJncW4yUDJEYlJhZzJ6TW0yV3lVcUJwT2tucFE5ZkdfRU5na2xPLVZmUdIBX0FVX3lxTFAxVk9peWJtREQ3LWFDWWlFU0VrYXFNUF9qVTRUZmFiTUd1TlZnQzlxbU1ZOEUya2dwMGxaRmFLY1dfc0IxUmpxa1ZRYnY2RXM1YXM5UTZjbWRxalNKaHBv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 bWszMR"&gt;Brain surgery took my childhood memories - will new op make me forget my fiance?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-b42e7a8f-0 haItSe"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-b42e7a8f-12 fcCDwR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-b42e7a8f-5 evAEAB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-b42e7a8f-7 khDNZq"&gt;Debbie Jackson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-8 jtKrhe"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC Scotland News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-4 cVwCpL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp" alt="Weronika Somerville Weronika takes a selfie on a country lane, with a path leading off behind her and hedges on her right side, a row of trees on her left.

            Scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China have discovered a new lineage of a coronavirus in bats that can enter human cells in a similar fashion as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, according to a recently published study. But there are no reported infections in humans, and experts say it’s not currently a threat to public health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0005336mydd5hlr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like SARS-CoV-2, HKU5-CoV-2 can enter cells via the human ACE2 receptor protein on cell surfaces. The newly identified coronavirus is a part of the same family as the virus&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that causes deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0006336mjct6j2dz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the study, published last week in the &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867425001448%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"&gt;journal Cell&lt;/a&gt;, scientists found the coronavirus in anal swab samples taken from a bat of the genus Pipistrellus. A lab experiment showed that the virus could infect human cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktfg8p0000336m4og41alu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pointing to the fact that researchers have not detected any infections in humans, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an email to CNN that it was aware of the publication “but there is no reason to believe it currently poses a concern to public health.” The CDC added that it “will continue to monitor viral disease activity and provide important updates to the public.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0007336maew2jupu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists say the newly identified coronavirus doesn’t&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;infect cells as efficiently as the virus that causes Covid-19. But with the work originating at the Wuhan, China, lab that’s been the target of questions about where Covid-19 originated, it quickly captured attention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0008336mj036donw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the new research contains some pandemic-associated trigger words, Dr. Amira Roess said there is no reason for concern.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0009336mcwwfis2z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even the researchers themselves point out that this should not cause panic,” said Roess, a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University’s College of Public Health who&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has worked with international colleagues to better understand the MERS coronavirus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000a336mmq2ium3v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Research like this study is important, Roess said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000b336mho8jktqz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It helps us understand what happens in the event that this does spill over and pose a risk. It’s good to get ahead of that,” she said. “The more we know about these viruses, the better.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000e336mdbjludpx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In experiments, antiviral medications that worked against SARS-CoV-2 also seemed to be active against the newly named coronavirus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000c336m8uho3xg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Alex Greninger, a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the University of Washington Medical Center, who developed tests to detect Covid-19 early in the pandemic, described nature as “the best bioterrorist” but also agreed that people shouldn’t be alarmed about the newly identified&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;coronavirus – or even surprised that scientists found it in bats.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000d336me4dxq8ud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are probably a lot of coronaviruses circulating in bats that can enter human cells,” Greninger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000f336msldtthga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If people want to worry, Greninger said, they can worry about the other coronaviruses that are endemic and making people sick right now. The viruses 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032340181400222X" target="_blank"&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; the common cold. They give most people only minor respiratory issues, but such infections can also develop into pneumonia or croup.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000g336mo1etjujn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re here every winter, so frankly, we should be talking about those rather than HKU5,” Greninger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000h336mrp6272x3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Phoebe Lostroh, author of “Molecular and Cellular Biology of Viruses,” said headlines about how this newly named coronavirus could cause the next pandemic are overblown and “not helpful,” particularly when there is already fear in the world about the US withdrawing from global health efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000i336mo1o5xowy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think we ought to be a lot more worried about problems like avian flu and its impact on cows and kitties and all sorts of other mammals than this new coronavirus that was isolated from a population of bats in China that reminds us of SARS-CoV-2 but is not really a breakthrough discovery,” said Lostroh, an associate professor of molecular biology at Colorado College.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000j336mui5ho26x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Roess said the study highlights why scientists collaborate globally to monitor and understand viruses that have the potential to hurt human health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000k336m3jrxq9w1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s sad to think about how we’re separating ourselves from the global public health world,” she said. Under President Donald Trump, the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" target="_blank"&gt;US is withdrawing&lt;/a&gt; from the World Health Organization and has ceased support of health programs through USAID. “This highlights to me why it’s so important to do global work and to do these global collaborations over the long haul.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “There’s other things that bats carry that can be very problematic for people,” she said. “So respect these wild animals, don’t interact with them too much, because you could end up hurting them and yourself.”

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktfek400la2dp9gao36r9l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China have discovered a new lineage of a coronavirus in bats that can enter human cells in a similar fashion as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, according to a recently published study. But there are no reported infections in humans, and experts say it’s not currently a threat to public health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0005336mydd5hlr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like SARS-CoV-2, HKU5-CoV-2 can enter cells via the human ACE2 receptor protein on cell surfaces. The newly identified coronavirus is a part of the same family as the virus&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that causes deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0006336mjct6j2dz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the study, published last week in the &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867425001448%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"&gt;journal Cell&lt;/a&gt;, scientists found the coronavirus in anal swab samples taken from a bat of the genus Pipistrellus. A lab experiment showed that the virus could infect human cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktfg8p0000336m4og41alu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pointing to the fact that researchers have not detected any infections in humans, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an email to CNN that it was aware of the publication “but there is no reason to believe it currently poses a concern to public health.” The CDC added that it “will continue to monitor viral disease activity and provide important updates to the public.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0007336maew2jupu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists say the newly identified coronavirus doesn’t&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;infect cells as efficiently as the virus that causes Covid-19. But with the work originating at the Wuhan, China, lab that’s been the target of questions about where Covid-19 originated, it quickly captured attention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0008336mj036donw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the new research contains some pandemic-associated trigger words, Dr. Amira Roess said there is no reason for concern.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0009336mcwwfis2z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even the researchers themselves point out that this should not cause panic,” said Roess, a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University’s College of Public Health who&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has worked with international colleagues to better understand the MERS coronavirus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000a336mmq2ium3v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Research like this study is important, Roess said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000b336mho8jktqz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It helps us understand what happens in the event that this does spill over and pose a risk. It’s good to get ahead of that,” she said. “The more we know about these viruses, the better.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000e336mdbjludpx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In experiments, antiviral medications that worked against SARS-CoV-2 also seemed to be active against the newly named coronavirus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000c336m8uho3xg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Alex Greninger, a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the University of Washington Medical Center, who developed tests to detect Covid-19 early in the pandemic, described nature as “the best bioterrorist” but also agreed that people shouldn’t be alarmed about the newly identified&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;coronavirus – or even surprised that scientists found it in bats.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000d336me4dxq8ud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are probably a lot of coronaviruses circulating in bats that can enter human cells,” Greninger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000f336msldtthga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If people want to worry, Greninger said, they can worry about the other coronaviruses that are endemic and making people sick right now. The viruses 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032340181400222X" target="_blank"&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; the common cold. They give most people only minor respiratory issues, but such infections can also develop into pneumonia or croup.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000g336mo1etjujn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re here every winter, so frankly, we should be talking about those rather than HKU5,” Greninger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000h336mrp6272x3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Phoebe Lostroh, author of “Molecular and Cellular Biology of Viruses,” said headlines about how this newly named coronavirus could cause the next pandemic are overblown and “not helpful,” particularly when there is already fear in the world about the US withdrawing from global health efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000i336mo1o5xowy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think we ought to be a lot more worried about problems like avian flu and its impact on cows and kitties and all sorts of other mammals than this new coronavirus that was isolated from a population of bats in China that reminds us of SARS-CoV-2 but is not really a breakthrough discovery,” said Lostroh, an associate professor of molecular biology at Colorado College.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000j336mui5ho26x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Roess said the study highlights why scientists collaborate globally to monitor and understand viruses that have the potential to hurt human health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000k336m3jrxq9w1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s sad to think about how we’re separating ourselves from the global public health world,” she said. Under President Donald Trump, the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" target="_blank"&gt;US is withdrawing&lt;/a&gt; from the World Health Organization and has ceased support of health programs through USAID. “This highlights to me why it’s so important to do global work and to do these global collaborations over the long haul.”

But she also suggests focusing on an &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a30813088/80-20-diet-weight-lifting-weight-loss-success-story/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a30813088/80-20-diet-weight-lifting-weight-loss-success-story/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="80/20 style of eating" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;80/20 style of eating&lt;/a&gt;, where you try to eat healthy 80 percent of the time and are more lenient with what you eat for the other 20 percent of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Keatley also suggests consuming fermented foods like yogurt, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a29892608/health-benefits-of-kimchi/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a29892608/health-benefits-of-kimchi/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="kimchi" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;kimchi&lt;/a&gt;, and kefir, which have probiotics that can help regulate neurotransmitter levels in the brain, along with nut and seeds, which provide omega-3 fatty acids that reduce inflammation and enhance gut-brain communication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Legumes, fatty fish, and leafy green vegetables may also help, per Keatley. “Together, these foods create a diet that supports gut health, reduces systemic inflammation, and enhances neurotransmitter balance, all of which contribute to lowering the risk of depression,” he says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="editorial-link" data-lazy-id="P0-17" data-node-id="32" class="embed"&gt;&lt;aside class="css-13bgmn2 e94w1mj9"&gt;&lt;h6 class="css-eoj2tz e94w1mj7"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-13p2wp0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj5"&gt;More From WH On Your Gut And Microbiomes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-this-effect-compare-to-antidepressant-medications" data-node-id="33" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this effect compare to antidepressant medications?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Well, this study specifically looked at preventing depression. Antidepressants are usually used to &lt;em&gt;treat&lt;/em&gt; depression, Gallagher points out. So, it’s not clear, based on these findings, how eating oranges when you already have depression may impact your symptoms or treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But this is important: “Don’t go off your medications and start eating oranges,” Gallagher says. Saltz agrees. "I would not advise anyone based on this study to in any way consider oranges a treatment for clinical major depression," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Still, Gallagher calls the findings “exciting” for mental health. “This is something that you could easily implement in your diet and probably should regardless,” she says. “It’s accessible, and that’s always a good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-19s3ilq ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

So, if you’re a grapefruit fan, you can feel good knowing that you’re also doing your mental health a solid by having a daily serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is citrus so special?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things about citrus that seem to give it extra oomph when it comes to improving mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The real game-changer in citrus is its high concentration of flavonoids, such as naringenin and formononetin,” Keatley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These flavonoids help support the growth of the essential bacteria &lt;em&gt;F. prausnitzii, &lt;/em&gt;and also may regulate processes in the gut that help increase the availability of our "feel-good" neurotransmitters, serotonin and dopamine, in the body, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But keep in mind that the study's findings don't actually &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; that consuming citrus influences your mental health—they just establish a link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also only looks at one aspect of citrus' impact on the gut, and specifically, the bacterial link, points out &lt;a href="https://doctors.nyp.org/gail-m-saltz-md/1095-park-avenue" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gail Saltz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gail Saltz&lt;/a&gt;, MD, associate professor of psychiatry at the NY Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Citrus may impact the gut biome, but it also has other features, such as high vitamin C, which could figure into this story," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there other foods that can lower depression risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2809727" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has found a link between eating a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63592662/ultraprocessed-foods-list/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ultra-processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; and a higher risk of depression, which suggests that eating whole, unprocessed foods may be better for your mental and physical health, Gallagher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher adds that focusing on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and foods that don’t have a lot of ingredients is the “safe route” when it comes to eating for mental health. But she also suggests focusing on an &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a30813088/80-20-diet-weight-lifting-weight-loss-success-story/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:80/20 style of eating;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;80/20 style of eating&lt;/a&gt;, where you try to eat healthy 80 percent of the time and are more lenient with what you eat for the other 20 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keatley also suggests consuming fermented foods like yogurt, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a29892608/health-benefits-of-kimchi/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kimchi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;kimchi&lt;/a&gt;, and kefir, which have probiotics that can help regulate neurotransmitter levels in the brain, along with nut and seeds, which provide omega-3 fatty acids that reduce inflammation and enhance gut-brain communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legumes, fatty fish, and leafy green vegetables may also help, per Keatley. “Together, these foods create a diet that supports gut health, reduces systemic inflammation, and enhances neurotransmitter balance, all of which contribute to lowering the risk of depression,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this effect compare to antidepressant medications?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, this study specifically looked at preventing depression. Antidepressants are usually used to &lt;em&gt;treat&lt;/em&gt; depression, Gallagher points out. So, it’s not clear, based on these findings, how eating oranges when you already have depression may impact your symptoms or treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is important: “Don’t go off your medications and start eating oranges,” Gallagher says. Saltz agrees. "I would not advise anyone based on this study to in any way consider oranges a treatment for clinical major depression," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Gallagher calls the findings “exciting” for mental health. “This is something that you could easily implement in your diet and probably should regardless,” she says. “It’s accessible, and that’s always a good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 22:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5EejhvWnFyRHR0YkxDZE1DTHZzaHp5YmI5ZVllLXZMNnFsWEZkdjNobm4tbnhxQm1lLUVHV0E4Zm9KZUZLTS1Ib0hQVkktUWZUTjZnNUs5ZzdjanBmWUFTOE55Wm5vT240WmlYOWhWYkMzdw</guid></item><item><title>Plant Chemicals May Counteract Harmful Microplastics - Newsmax</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNUGtrTEtfX1gwNnkwWklreFpRN3l3cFZJMmhxOVNjX3VubnEzVlg5aEJ0U1ZqRmdWNTU5UFVRVzVqYThDQ2pCWWpKVURVNktqS1JnZi16TmdlN0pMMHF0QjhOUTIyY3NUc1VKbGxLV0twWXRvbjdnXzBZS0Z2eTJsbi1fNmlhNjJ3UFAwOXhDSkdSUTJocTdoZFZlcWtOZlJoZ2h0Y0k5QXnSAa4BQVVfeXFMT3RqaWtXVnFqT3l6WVdldkZQendJMGRCLXZnZ2s1dUJjaGw5eldpWlRjVVRQemdQMk85UDVHLTIyT0hJTFlqWmxnYmdaVW9fVW9pMm1aRlI2eWZtRXB1TE1ob0lYUllIYmxCRExSdTBmeHRWWkZtM3JyclZka3JNSE53RDF6WnNMekhWaEtzMEJqYklLQmQ0OEp1SzJzbEhUakUzbE1GNGh5MTl3T2Z3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mainArticleDiv" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;A promising new study found that eating lots of fruit and vegetables that are naturally high in antioxidants may lessen the harmful effects of microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers with the Finland-China Food and Health Network published their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11803829/"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; on how anthocyanins, a type of antioxidant flavonoid, can counteract the oxidative stress caused by these tiny plastic particles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthocyanins are pigments that give red, purple, and blue fruits and vegetables their vibrant colors. They are found in foods such as blueberries, raspberries, and eggplants. These compounds have been shown to possess strong antioxidant properties that help safeguard our cells from damage and support overall health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/24/antioxidants-fruits-flowers-microplastics"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, the anthocyanins protect against a wide range of plastic-induced negative effects including reduction in testosterone and estrogen, decreased sperm counts and poorer quality sperm, erectile dysfunction and ovarian damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are &lt;a href="https://www.newsmax.com/health/health-news/microplastics-nanoplastics-tissues/2024/12/30/id/1193369/"&gt;everywhere&lt;/a&gt;. They are tiny plastic particles, less than 5 millimeters in diameter, that originate from a variety of sources including larger plastic debris that degrades into smaller and smaller pieces, and from microbeads found in beauty products, cleaning products, and industrial processes. These particles are so small that they can pass through water filtration systems and end up in oceans and other bodies of water, where they become a pervasive environmental pollutant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many as 16,000 chemicals, many of which are toxic, such as BPA, phthalates, and PFAS, known as “forever chemicals” because they last a long time, are found in microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microplastics can absorb harmful chemicals from their surroundings, which can then enter the human body when the microplastics are ingested, leading to various health issues. Some studies suggest that microplastics can disrupt hormone function in humans, leading to reproductive health issues, including decreased fertility, reduced sperm quality, and hormonal imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the reproductive system, microplastics have been found in the testicles and semen in men. In women, they’ve been discovered in ovarian tissue, placentas, breast milk and fetuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the new study, researchers found that male rats that were exposed to microplastics and then treated with anthocyanins had increased sperm counts and motility. Treating female rats with anthocyanins seemed to protect hormone receptors from the plastic chemicals and normalized levels of estrogen and other hormones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While human studies are needed, researchers say their findings are promising in the search for ways to combat the onslaught of microplastics. Eating plenty of fruits, nuts, and vegetables, are a good way to help protect against the damage in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The skulls of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/famous-viking-runestone-linked-to-fears-of-climate-change-says-study"&gt;Viking-age Swedes&lt;/a&gt;, dated between the 10th and 12th centuries, suggest the population of the time was suffering from a wide variety of ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Gothenburg and Västergötlands Museum in Sweden analyzed the human remains using modern computed tomography (CT) scans and found evidence of mouth diseases, jaw joint damage, sinus and ear infections, tooth decay, osteoarthritis, and other problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There was much to look at," &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/news/viking-skulls-reveal-severe-morbidity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; odontologist Carolina Bertilsson, from the University of Gothenburg. "We found many signs of disease in these individuals."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Exactly why we don't know. While we can't study the damage in the soft tissue because it's no longer there, we can see the traces left in the skeletal structures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153142" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153142" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullScan.jpg" alt="Skull scan" class="wp-image-153142 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullScan.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullScan-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullScan-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153142" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The skulls were put through a CT scanner. (Bertilsson et al., &lt;em&gt;British Dental Journal Open&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team took a close look at 15 skulls collected from the well-known &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varnhem_Abbey"&gt;Varnhem Abbey&lt;/a&gt; archaeological site in the province of Västergötland. The skulls were taken from adults who died between the ages of 24 and 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan"&gt;CT scans&lt;/a&gt; – which are precise types of X-ray scans, taken in three dimensions – the researchers saw damage to both the surface and the interior of the skulls, and they mapped that damage to probable causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153144" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153144" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullDamage.jpg" alt="Skull damage" class="wp-image-153144 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullDamage.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullDamage-396x415.jpg 396w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullDamage-600x629.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153144" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A variety of types of skull damage were discovered. (Bertilsson et al., &lt;em&gt;British Dental Journal Open&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a demonstration of just how much valuable information can be revealed by these types of scans on these kinds of remains, giving us a better idea of how these people lived, back when there were far fewer treatments for pain and disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everyone knows what it's like to have pain somewhere, you can get quite desperate for help," &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/news/viking-skulls-reveal-severe-morbidity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bertilsson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But back then, they didn't have the medical and dental care we do, or the kind of pain relief – and antibiotics – we now have. If you developed an infection, it could stick around for a long time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the research team behind this study had &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-studied-3000-viking-teeth-and-discovered-surprisingly-advanced-dentistry"&gt;previously looked&lt;/a&gt; at teeth recovered from the same site, finding extensive evidence of tooth decay and even some rudimentary attempts at dentistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work has been ongoing at the Varnhem site &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/news/new-excavations-in-varnhem"&gt;for decades now&lt;/a&gt;. It's a significant religious landmark, once the largest church in Sweden, and is the resting place for three Swedish kings from the Middle Ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that applying their CT scan approach to other ancient remains could reveal all kinds of new discoveries that wouldn't be spotted with a normal visual inspection – and without causing unnecessary damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Very many of today's archaeological methods are invasive, with the need to remove bone or other tissue for analysis," &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/news/viking-skulls-reveal-severe-morbidity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bertilsson. "This way, we can keep the remains completely intact yet still extract a great deal of information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41405-025-00309-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;British Dental Journal Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(25)00039-2/fulltext"&gt;&lt;span&gt;systematic review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of five studies concludes that, even after successful tuberculosis (TB) treatment, children and teens experience substantial respiratory impairment, with 40% to 65% having abnormal lung function and those younger than 10 years showing reduced height and weight and lower quality of life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;McGill University researchers in Canada led the review, published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;eClinical Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The team reviewed studies published from January 2004 to December 2024 involving children aged 0 to 19 years who completed TB treatment and had at least one related impairment or disability. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After identifying 117 potential studies, only 5—all published in 2023 and 2024 in South Africa or The Gambia—met the inclusion criteria, because over 80% excluded children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Tuberculosis remains a significant global health challenge, affecting over 10 million people annually, including more than 1 million children under 15 years of age," the researchers wrote. "Tuberculosis-associated respiratory impairment and disability, also known as post-tuberculosis lung disease, results from the complex interplay of bacterial, host, and environmental factors." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;TB effects differ in adults, children&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After TB treatment, children younger than 5 years had diminished respiratory capacity. Of those aged 5 to 10 years, about 40% had abnormal lung function post-treatment, rising to 65% in those older than 10. Disability was common, with 35% to 50% of all children experiencing respiratory symptoms (eg, wheezing, cough) and children younger than 10 years displaying reduced physical growth and lower quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after successful tuberculosis treatment, children and adolescents can experience respiratory impairments and disability that may reduce their quality of life, ability to participate in activities, and growth potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even after successful tuberculosis treatment, children and adolescents can experience respiratory impairments and disability that may reduce their quality of life, ability to participate in activities, and growth potential," they wrote. "The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of these impairments vary by age, reflecting distinct biological and behavioural differences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers call for future TB research involving children. &lt;span&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;Given the differences in the spectrum of tuberculosis disease, lung development, and underlying comorbidity differences between children, adolescents, and adults, age-disaggregated data are essential to fully understand the long-term impact of tuberculosis on respiratory health throughout the life course," they concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The birds have been dying from avian influenza. (Kyle Telechan for the Post-Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandhill cranes started dying from the flu strain in early January in Jackson County, where many overwinter and feast on the remains of corn fields, Fleace said, adding at least 500 dead cranes were reported to the DNR there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By late January, as sandhill cranes began to migrate from the south to Northwest Indiana and Michigan, “a lot of those cranes had influenza.” Many of those birds migrated from Tennessee, Florida and Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This year they brought avian influenza with them and it just ripped through the population very quickly,” Fleace said, adding 1,500 dead sandhill cranes have been reported to him. “That’s likely an underestimate. There’s birds that die that nobody sees,” or people see them and don’t report them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of limited resources, Fleace said the DNR can’t test every bird but there’s only been one sandhill crane he tested that didn’t have avian influenza and he suspects that was a false negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On a smaller scale, humans really can’t do much in a single season,” he said, adding the virus thrives in cold weather and birds are migrating in large flocks. “You can’t ask them to isolate from each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carcass disposal of dead birds might remove the virus from the landscape, Fleace said, but not the living bird population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That also has its own risks, though they are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do ask that you avoid contact with waterfowl because this is a zoonotic disease. A zoonotic disease is a disease that can spread from animals to humans,” Fleace said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who chooses to remove dead birds should wear a mask and gloves, double-bag the carcass, wash their hands and disinfect their clothes, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1854350" class="wp-caption alignnone size-article_inline"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2019/10/25/TMRMGHB4LVHA7NRQGV54WOXBXU.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="Sandhill cranes congregate on a field at the Jasper-Pulaski Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife Area in Medaryville, Indiana on Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2019." data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2019/10/25/TMRMGHB4LVHA7NRQGV54WOXBXU.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" data-attachment-id="1854350" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2019/10/25/TMRMGHB4LVHA7NRQGV54WOXBXU.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w,https://i0.wp.com/www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2019/10/25/TMRMGHB4LVHA7NRQGV54WOXBXU.jpg?fit=780%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 780w,https://i0.wp.com/www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2019/10/25/TMRMGHB4LVHA7NRQGV54WOXBXU.jpg?fit=810%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 810w,https://i0.wp.com/www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2019/10/25/TMRMGHB4LVHA7NRQGV54WOXBXU.jpg?fit=1280%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 1280w,https://i0.wp.com/www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2019/10/25/TMRMGHB4LVHA7NRQGV54WOXBXU.jpg?fit=1860%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 1860w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit"&gt;Kyle Telechan / Post-Tribune&lt;/p&gt;Sandhill cranes congregate on a field at the Jasper-Pulaski Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife Area in Medaryville, Indiana on Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2019. The birds are dying from avian flu. (Kyle Telechan for the Post-Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a Jan. 6 release from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one person in Louisiana died from avian influenza and “there have been 66 confirmed human cases of H5N1 bird flu in the United States since 2024.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside the U.S., more than 950 cases of H5N1 bird flu have been reported to the World Health Organization and about half of those have resulted in death, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most importantly, no person-to-person transmission spread has been identified. As with the case in Louisiana, most H5 bird flu infections are related to animal-to-human exposures,” the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus, Fleace with the DNR said, is more deadly in domestic poultry because they don’t have the same immune systems as birds living in the wild, and even the risk to humans “is very low.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greater concern with transmission to humans, he said, is that the more people who get the virus, the more chance there is that the virus could mutate and become something worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who finds a dead bird is asked to report it online at on.in.gov/sickwildlife. They might not get a response because the DNR is getting so many reports, Fleace said, but the reports help him keep track of the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of spring should decrease the number of deaths, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re expecting them to taper off as the weather warms up,” Fleace said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;alavalley@chicagotribune.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But carbs can actually help you achieve your weight loss goals—and oats are the No. 1 whole grain for weight loss, according to nutrition experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No disrespect to the die-hard &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8067257/keto-2-0/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:keto fans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;keto fans&lt;/a&gt; out there, but our bodies need carbs for energy—and there’s no argument about that. So before you pass up the air-popped popcorn, know that not all carbs are created equal. “Yes, whole grains contain carbs, but they’re jam-packed with nutrients such as B vitamins, folate, iron, zinc and magnesium. They’re an excellent source of fiber and antioxidants,” says Kulp. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8022085/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-avoid-carbs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What Happens to Your Body When You Avoid Carbs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What Happens to Your Body When You Avoid Carbs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown rice, oats, barley and spelt are a few whole grains with nutrient profiles that differ from their &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:refined-grain counterparts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;refined-grain counterparts&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s most important to understand for grain to be whole, it must contain all parts of the grain—the germ, bran and endosperm. That is where the magic happens in terms of health benefits,” says &lt;a href="https://www.pritikin.com/kara-burnstine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kara Burnstine, M.S., RD, LDN, CDCES;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kara Burnstine, M.S., RD, LDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, at Pritikin Longevity Center. Refined grains, on the other hand, are processed to remove at least one of these critical parts of the grain kernel, reducing its nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avena sativa&lt;/em&gt;, aka oats, comes from a plant in the &lt;em&gt;Poaceae&lt;/em&gt; family and ranks in the top three most important grains in the U.S., right after wheat and corn, per a 2023 review in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9930024/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Current Nutrition Reports;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Nutrition Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Short- and long-term oats consumption lowers cholesterol levels, regulates blood sugars and improves liver functions. These factors can promote sustainable weight loss and lower your risk of weight gain,” says &lt;a href="https://melissamitri.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Melissa Mitri, RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Melissa Mitri, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition writer and owner of Melissa Mitri Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no single food is a silver bullet for losing weight, oats may help you reach your weight-loss goals in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photographer: Jen Causey, Food Stylist: Chelsea Zimmer, Prop Stylist: Julia Bayless&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pictured Recipe: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/apple-crumble-overnight-oats-7973482" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Apple Crumble Overnight Oats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Apple Crumble Overnight Oats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Health Benefits of Oats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Keep You Fuller Longer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; encourage most adults to eat between 25 and 34 grams of fiber daily. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7872901/health-benefits-of-steel-cut-oats/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Steel-cut oats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Steel-cut oats&lt;/a&gt;, one of the highest-fiber versions of oats you can find, offers 8 grams of fiber in every half-cup, per the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/878438/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;. That’s 24% to 32% of the Daily Value for fiber!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oats can help with weight loss by affecting appetite hormones and feeding your gut microbes. They have a unique antioxidant called beta-glucan, which works as a prebiotic, fueling the good gut microbes that can impact appetite hormones, GLP-1 and PYY. These hormones slow down stomach emptying to keep you feeling full longer, and the hormone leptin tells your body it’s had enough and it’s time to stop eating. This combination can lead to eating less at a meal and not feeling hungry for longer,” explains Kulp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Provide Plant-Based Protein&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next to other types of whole grains, like wheat, rice and millet, oats outshine the competition when it comes to protein. Oat protein is plentiful in essential amino acids, including valine, lysine and isoleucine, per a 2022 review published in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9294724/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Frontiers in Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not a complete protein, a half-cup of steel-cut oats provides 10 grams of protein. That's more than twice the amount of protein in half a cup of cow’s milk, per the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/746782/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;. Like fiber, the protein in oats may help satisfy your appetite, curbing your calorie intake. Further, a growing body of research has shown that high protein intake may help lower body weight and decrease fat mass while preserving lean muscle, per a 2024 study in &lt;a href="https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.16013" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Might Help Balance Your Blood Sugars&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research also suggests that whole grains have a lower glycemic index, a scale that rates foods based on how quickly they spike your blood sugar levels,” says Mitri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The soluble fiber in oats [helps] slow down the absorption of carbohydrates and helps regulate blood sugar levels by preventing blood sugar spikes and subsequent cravings for sugary foods,” adds Burnstine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, beta-glucan, a type of fiber abundantly found in oats, may help maintain normal levels of insulin—the hormone responsible for managing blood sugar levels, per a 2022 review published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214799322001096" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Current Opinion in Food Science;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Opinion in Food Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Many Ways to Add to Your Diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats are heaping with nutrients, especially minerals like magnesium, manganese, iron, chromium and zinc. What’s more, they’re budget-friendly, convenient and easily incorporated into meals and snacks you can enjoy anytime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for other ways to enjoy oats beyond a typical oatmeal, there are many ways to get creative in the kitchen with oats. In the evenings, you could mix oats, milk, apples and cinnamon to enjoy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/268076/apple-cinnamon-overnight-oats/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Apple-Cinnamon Overnight Oats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Apple-Cinnamon Overnight Oats&lt;/a&gt; for a quick grab-and-go breakfast the next morning.

People usually experience their first taste of oats as instant oats, and they may love the taste and ease of instant,” says &lt;a href="https://mynutritioninsights.com/index.php/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amy Beney, M.S., RD, CDCES;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amy Beney, M.S., RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavored instant oats tend to have a lot of added sugar but if you choose unflavored instant oats, their nutritional profile is pretty similar to steel-cut and rolled oats. And Beney notes that steel-cut oats are the least processed type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Whole Grains and Weight Loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often celebrate whole grains for their heart-healthy benefits, from lowering cholesterol to improving blood pressure. Their fiber, antioxidants, and vitamins and minerals profile may also benefit weight loss. However, some falsely believe that eating high-fiber foods causes weight gain when, in fact, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8070018/fiber-and-weight-gain/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:it may do the opposite;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;it may do the opposite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies do suggest whole grains can assist with weight loss. The fiber in whole grains is like a speed bump in a road and slows digestion, which in turn aids in the fullness factor,” says Burnstine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example is a 2024 study published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11280444/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which notes that including whole grains in your eating routine may aid in weight management by helping you lose weight and preventing weight gain. This study also suggests that higher whole grain intake is associated with lower odds of obesity, including in general and abdominal obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you eat whole grains at all, you may notice they’re chewier in texture than refined grains and tend to take longer to cook and more bites to eat. This may lead to more satiety. “This high fiber content can help you to feel full and satisfied, naturally leading to fewer calories consumed,” says Kulp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to satiety, whole grains can help with blood sugar. “Whole grains provide a steady source of energy due to their &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290631/what-is-a-complex-carbohydrate/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:complex carbohydrates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;complex carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;. This can help stabilize blood sugar levels and prevent energy crashes that might lead to unhealthy snacking,” says &lt;a href="https://carolinefarrell.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Caroline Farrell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Caroline Farrell&lt;/a&gt;, a registered nutritionist in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Along with their fiber, whole grains also contain polyphenols, a plant nutrient that can feed good gut microbes,” adds Kulp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods that feed gut-friendly bacteria are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8052689/best-prebiotic-foods-for-better-gut-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:known as prebiotics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;known as prebiotics&lt;/a&gt;. "[Prebiotics] enhance the diversity and function of gut microbiota, which can influence energy balance (how your body uses and stores energy) and fat storage,” says Magil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats are a nutritious whole grain that can help you achieve your weight loss goals. “Many people think they have to eat a low-carb diet to lose weight or are unsure which carbs are best to eat. I would recommend they focus on what to add to their diet versus what to restrict for weight loss,” says Mitri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, consider which nutrients are you low in—like fiber—and what foods are rich in those nutrients—like oats. You can add oats—or other fiber-rich grains—at any time of day, whether it’s for dinner or an energizing snack. Their potent nutrition from fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants may make them worthy of complementing your weight-loss efforts and health overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7866255/foods-you-should-eat-every-week-to-lose-weight/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:11 Foods to Eat to Help You Lose Weight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;11 Foods to Eat to Help You Lose Weight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-whole-grain-for-weight-loss-11686388" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 20:52:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFA4RTNnTXM5TDJMb3NPYzZodEV1SV82NWxVZlVEWDJQUVR4V2pHVmRoQlUyWXB3cjMzS2VuR2pEMW1lTzJfNF9tcmJQNmlja0dvNDRPZzk1M3NLRUYzWEgzNV9MVUoxcGh6VzBJZQ</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Discover New Coronavirus With Potential to Infect Humans: What to Know - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxNMVo5bzRJWDEyUXNpMWpIR3dPa3p0V0hiVXVFaV9tRkxIbWMxaGxOd3A4RVZ1ZjRNUy1JUXhJc0l5dGFna0JpWGwxTGd2REkyWHQwdTEyeURBNmo0ZmRaWnpiYTkzNnRvd1pqUm9vNHRyVHdwRXlSU0FaY1BiTXk0N1VBQ0FSX1NNcU1aMU1pRkMzZmR2RE50ZkVfOTRpd0JrbHdLSXcwM3VWMU9aUjZRZg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;New research out this month showcases the ever-present danger posed by coronaviruses, the family of viruses that gave rise to the covid-19 pandemic. Scientists in China have reportedly found a new coronavirus in bats that may be capable of spilling over and infecting humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology led the study, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last week in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. In lab experiments, the virus appeared to possess a key adaptation that allows it to infect a broad range of mammals, humans included. Other factors are present that make the virus less suited to humans for now, but the scientists say their discovery highlights the importance of studying these sorts of potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coronaviruses are a broad group of viruses that infect mammals and birds, seven of which are known to infect humans. Four of these viruses usually cause a mild cold; one caused a major but short-lived epidemic in the early 2000s (the original SARS virus); another causes MERS, a dangerous but limited zoonotic disease that typically spreads from camels to humans; and SARS-CoV-2—the recently discovered coronavirus that caused the worst pandemic seen in a century, &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid#:~:text=The%20Economist%20built,COVID%2D19.19"&gt;killing upwards of 20 million people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide since appearing in late 2019. Though covid-19 is substantially less deadly now, thanks in large part to vaccines, it still &lt;a href="https://x.com/BNOFeed/status/1893852906765295894"&gt;routinely kills&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of Americans weekly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even before the arrival of covid-19, scientists have long worried about the risk of coronaviruses sparking the next big outbreak, given how widespread they are across the animal kingdom. In 2006, researchers in Hong Kong &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7111821/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a coronavirus in pipistrelle bats that became known as HKU5-CoV. The discovery was valuable, even if the virus itself didn’t seem to possess the machinery needed to infect humans easily. But the Wuhan scientists say they have now discovered a distinct lineage of HKU5-CoV more capable of jumping over to humans, which they’ve dubbed HKU5-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In the lab, the researchers found evidence that HKU5-CoV-2 could potentially infect a wide range of mammals. It does so by interacting with a protein receptor found in many types of cells, called ACE2. For those who kept up with pandemic-era science, ACE2 is the same receptor that SARS-CoV-2 hacks to infect our cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mammals have slightly different versions of ACE2 from one another, and it’s no guarantee that a bat-infecting coronavirus can bind to the human version of ACE2. But the team’s work found that strains of HKU5-CoV-2 could “efficiently” use human ACE2 (and other mammalian versions of ACE2) to enter cells. HKU5-CoV-2 is more closely related to the MERS virus than SARS-CoV-2 and the researchers also found evidence that antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 may offer little protection against HKU5-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;These findings, however, do not mean that HKU5-CoV-2 is destined to become the next covid. Importantly, no human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 have been reported to date. And even if a virus can theoretically spread from one kind of animal to humans, that doesn’t ensure it will be able to spread between people (the vast majority of the time, it doesn’t). Perhaps significantly, the researchers identified other aspects of the newly found virus that likely hinders it from infecting people easily—a key point they highlighted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Due to these suboptimal factors for human adaptation, the risk of BtHKU5-CoV-2 emergence in human populations should not be exaggerated,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;What this research does show, however, is that our fight against emerging infectious diseases exists in perpetuity. HKU5-CoV-2 might never jump over into humans, but others like it eventually could. Whether it’s a coronavirus, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/tag/bird-flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, or some other unknown germ, the stage for the next pandemic will be set. So tracking and learning more about these threats as early as possible will be essential to stopping or at least blunting the harm they can cause.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;
