			&lt;p&gt;"How often do you poop?" might sound like a very personal question, but your answer could reveal quite a lot about your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in July 2024 investigated how often 1,425 people went number two, and compared those stats to their demographic, genetic, and health data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The healthiest participants reported pooping once or twice a day – a 'Goldilocks zone' of bowel movement frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pooping too often or too rarely were both associated with different underlying health issues, the team led by researchers at the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/something-in-your-poop-may-predict-an-imminent-death?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Something in Your Poop May Predict an Imminent Death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study shows how bowel movement frequency can influence all body systems, and how aberrant bowel movement frequency may be an important risk factor in the development of chronic diseases," &lt;a href="https://isbscience.org/news/health/timing-is-everything-isb-study-finds-link-between-bowel-movement-frequency-and-overall-health/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; ISB microbiologist Sean Gibbons, the corresponding author of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These insights could inform strategies for managing bowel movement frequency, even in healthy populations, to optimize health and wellness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study investigated the bathroom habits of people who were "generally healthy" – that is, with no history of kidney or gut issues like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-7-common-daily-habits-could-be-damaging-your-kidneys"&gt;kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-have-sussed-out-a-driving-mechanism-behind-irritable-bowel-syndrome"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/blood-tests-can-reveal-crohns-disease-8-years-before-diagnosis"&gt;Crohn's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants self-reported how often they dropped the kids off at the pool, and the researchers organized them into four categories: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-constipation-could-be-having-a-serious-impact-on-your-heart"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt; for those reporting one or two bowel movements per week; low-normal for three to six movements per week; high-normal for one to three movements per day; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-diarrhea-cases-surging-across-uk-and-scientists-dont-know-why"&gt;diarrhea&lt;/a&gt; for four or more watery stools per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also analyzed patients' blood metabolites and chemistry, their genetics, and the gut microbes present in their stool samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_132891" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132891" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-642x578.jpg" alt="A graphic depicting the studied variables" class="size-medium wp-image-132891" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-642x578.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-461x415.jpg 461w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-600x540.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1.jpg 765w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132891" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Participants provided samples of blood plasma and stool, in addition to filling out extensive diet, health, and lifestyle questionnaires.

Those who gained the most strength showed changes in the makeup of their gut bacteria in just eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These kinds of changes might help some people move out of the constipation or diarrhea categories and into a healthier bowel-movement range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those in the Goldilocks zone of pooping reported eating more fiber, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-of-its-kind-study-lists-health-benefits-of-drinking-more-water-each-day"&gt;drinking more water&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pooping-before-you-exercise-has-an-incredible-effect-on-performance"&gt;exercising more often&lt;/a&gt;.

For many households, freezing bread is simply a practical step to reduce waste during colder months when groceries last longer and consumption patterns shift. Recent discussions among clinicians and nutrition researchers have highlighted that freezing may also influence how the body processes carbohydrates. In a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRkiUK4DRh5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;popular reel, Dr Kunal Sood explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; that freezing alters the structure of starch in ways that change how the digestive system responds to it. This has prompted renewed interest in understanding whether a basic habit like freezing bread can support healthier metabolic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hidden health &lt;keyword id="31113739" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="benefits-of-freezing-bread" source="Orion"&gt;benefits of freezing bread&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Kunal Sood describes the process clearly, saying, “Freezing your bread doesn’t just keep it from going stale, it can actually make it a little healthier. Here’s how. When bread is frozen and then defrosted, some of the starches go through a process called retrogradation. That’s when part of the starch structure reorganises and turns into what’s known as resistant starch.” Resistant starch behaves differently from the rapidly digested starches found in freshly baked bread. In his words, “Resistant starch acts more like fibre than sugar. Your body digests it more slowly, which leads to steadier blood sugar levels and less of a spike after eating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Five Effective Ways to Detoxify Your Gut Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This explanation aligns with findings from a controlled trial &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jpcmed.com/article_178948.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;published in Journal of Preventative and Complementary Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, which examined how freezing and reheating white bread affected the glycaemic response of healthy individuals. The researchers reported that freezing and then defrosting reduced post meal blood glucose spikes by up to 30 percent compared with fresh bread. As Dr Sood states, “One study even found that freezing and then defrosting white bread reduced post meal blood sugar spikes by up to 30 percent, compared to eating it fresh.” These effects offer a foundation for understanding the key benefits, which include better digestion and metabolic balance, antioxidant protection and immunity support, a more stable blood sugar response, improved gut microbiome function and higher natural energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The key health effects linked to freezing bread:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supports digestion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Boosts immunity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stabilizes blood sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improves &lt;keyword id="2049757" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="gut-health" source="Orion"&gt;gut health&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supports better daily energy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Better digestion and metabolic balance through resistant starch formation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When bread is exposed to freezing temperatures, the starch molecules gradually reorganise into a form that the body breaks down more slowly. This change means the digestive tract expends less effort managing sudden glucose surges, which often strain metabolic pathways during colder seasons when heavier meals are common. The presence of resistant starch encourages a steadier digestive rhythm, allowing nutrients to be absorbed at a smoother pace. Many individuals find that foods containing resistant starch contribute to prolonged satiety and more consistent digestive comfort, particularly when eaten during winter months when fluctuations in eating patterns tend to be more pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Antioxidant protection and immunity boost influenced by slower digestion&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slower carbohydrate digestion affects how antioxidants and micronutrients are released and absorbed. Winter diets often rely on preserved, reheated or starchy foods, which sometimes offer limited micronutrient density. Bread that has undergone freezing and retrogradation releases its sugars at a slower rate, which helps maintain more balanced cellular activity. This supports the immune system indirectly, because stable metabolic conditions improve the body’s capacity to regulate inflammation and oxidative stress. Although bread is not a primary antioxidant source, its altered digestibility helps regulate processes that protect immune cells from excessive metabolic strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. More stable blood sugar response supported by clinical findings&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A central benefit, articulated by both Dr Sood and the referenced study, is the measurable reduction in post meal blood glucose spikes. The shift toward resistant starch means the carbohydrate behaves more like dietary fibre, resulting in a gradual rise in glucose rather than a rapid surge. This is particularly relevant in winter, when many people rely on toast or warm sandwiches as quick energy sources. A gentler glycaemic response helps support concentration, appetite control and overall metabolic stability throughout the day. As Dr Sood adds, “If you toast it after freezing, the effect becomes even stronger,” suggesting that reheating may amplify this stabilising influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Improved gut microbiome function through increased resistant starch intake&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistant starch plays a recognised role in feeding beneficial gut bacteria, which rely on fermentable fibres to produce short chain fatty acids. These compounds support colon health, enhance nutrient absorption and contribute to balanced immune responses. Dr Sood highlights this when he says, “That slower digestion helps not just for glucose control but also supports gut health since resistant starch feeds the beneficial bacteria in your colon.” During winter, when digestive sluggishness and irregular meal timing are common, foods that nourish the microbiome can help maintain smoother digestive behaviour and improve overall wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Higher natural energy levels linked to steadier carbohydrate release&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy fluctuations in cold weather often reflect inconsistent glucose patterns influenced by refined carbohydrates. Freezing bread adjusts the structure of its starch in a way that creates a more gradual energy supply. Instead of a quick burst followed by fatigue, the body receives a sustained release that supports alertness and endurance throughout daily activities. This makes frozen then toasted bread a practical winter staple for individuals who rely on predictable energy, whether for work, study or exercise in colder conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

If you're struggling to remember things because of strain on your brain's cognitive abilities or even finding it hard to cope with motions, of course evidence of that will show up in every aspect of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From your home decor and clutter to the state of your car, little things can be an example of a person's internal dysregulation.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2024-084081"&gt;Millions of people&lt;/a&gt; around the world live with wounds that simply won't heal. These long-lasting wounds, often caused by  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="183027" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, poor circulation or pressure, can be painful, prone to infection and can seriously affect &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045253"&gt;quality of life&lt;/a&gt;. In severe cases, they can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2022.110194"&gt;lead to amputation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current treatments help manage symptoms, but they don't always address the underlying problem. That means dressings, antibiotics and repeated clinic visits, often for months or years. For many people, that cycle never truly ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the latest research published by my colleagues and myself &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2503308122"&gt;offers a new perspective&lt;/a&gt; on why some wounds just won't heal – and points to a potential new way of treating them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/injured-cells-can-vomit-waste-to-boost-healing-study-finds"&gt;Injured Cells Can 'Vomit' Waste to Boost Healing, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By studying both human tissue and experimental models, we found that a molecule in the skin called MC1R is consistently disrupted in chronic wounds. When we stimulated this molecule, the skin was able to reduce inflammation and begin healing again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MC1R is best known for something quite different from wound healing: the gene is responsible for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ng1195-328"&gt;red hair and very fair skin&lt;/a&gt;. But MC1R does far more than influence pigment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MC1R is found on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2503308122"&gt;many different types of skin cells&lt;/a&gt;, including immune cells, keratinocytes (the cells that form the outer layer of the skin), fibroblasts (the cells that make scar tissue) and the cells that line blood vessels. This means MC1R can influence several parts of the healing process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183035" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183035" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/layers_of_skin_642.jpg" alt="diagram of layers of skin" class="wp-image-183035 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/layers_of_skin_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/layers_of_skin_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183035" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;MC1R is found in a variety of skin tissues. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADmTPeRmHc/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The healing process is more complex than simply "closing" a wound. The skin first triggers inflammation (the body's early defence response that removes microbes and damaged tissue), then gradually turns that inflammation off to allow repair. When that switch-off fails, wounds can remain inflamed for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because MC1R has known &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.1078678"&gt;anti-inflammatory roles&lt;/a&gt; in other conditions such as arthritis, we wanted to know whether its behaviour might also help explain why chronic wounds fail to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer this, we used two complementary approaches. First, we analysed human tissue samples from three major types of chronic wounds: diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers and pressure ulcers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite having different causes, these wounds showed a similar problem: the mechanism that normally helps calm inflammation was disrupted. Both MC1R and its natural partner molecule, POMC, were also out of balance – and this imbalance was present across all wound types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, we used experimental models to understand how this disruption affects healing. We examined mice that carry a non-functional version of MC1R. These animals developed wounds that were slow to heal and showed some of the same features we see in human chronic wounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their wounds contained many inflammatory immune cells and abundant "neutrophil extracellular traps" – sticky webs of DNA and proteins that, when they persist, are associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-021-04294-3"&gt;ongoing inflammation and delayed repair&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183040" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183040" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/blood_clot_642.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-183040 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/blood_clot_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/blood_clot_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183040" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Magnified image of a blood clot, with trapped red and white cells. (Micro Discovery/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better replicate human chronic wounds, we also created a new mouse model that produces slow-healing, inflammation-rich ulcers. This allowed us to test potential treatments in conditions that closely mimic human disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we applied a topical drug that selectively activates MC1R, healing improved dramatically. The ulcers produced less exudate (the fluid that often leaks from chronic wounds), blood-vessel growth increased (improving the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the wound bed) and the outer layer of skin began to recover and close over the wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, activating MC1R reduced neutrophil extracellular traps and limited the arrival of new inflammatory cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also applied the drug to a small cut on healthy animals. Stimulating MC1R further boosted blood flow, improved lymphatic drainage and reduced scarring. This suggests MC1R supports healing not only when wounds are stuck, but also under normal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings indicate that MC1R plays a meaningful role in coordinating several key aspects of skin repair. When the pathway is disrupted, inflammation persists. When MC1R is activated, that inflammation can resolve and allow other healing processes to progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Healing chronic wounds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic wounds affect millions of people – and the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/wound.2023.0150"&gt;numbers are rising&lt;/a&gt; alongside global rates of diabetes, ageing and obesity. They're also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045253"&gt;extremely costly&lt;/a&gt; for healthcare systems. Even small improvements in healing could make a significant difference to patients and reduce strain on services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings raise the possibility of new treatments that target MC1R to help the skin move out of a chronic inflammatory state. Because we saw positive effects with a topical application, future therapies might take the form of ointments or gels that patients could apply themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed, identifying MC1R as a key pathway disrupted in chronic wounds gives us a clearer understanding of why some wounds fail to heal – and offers hope for finding new ways to help the skin repair itself.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268915/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

A recent study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; found a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01853-7/fulltext" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;drastic increase in the number of people with kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. The figures rose from 78 million people with the disease in 1990 to 788 million in 2023. Chronic kidney disease is now the ninth leading cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keeping the kidneys safe is crucial, and some simple tests can reveal your kidney health. In a video shared on Instagram, Dr Arjun Sabharwal, a nephrologist trained at DY Patil School of Medicine, Mumbai, and the Royal College of Physicians, UK, has highlighted some tests that can help rule out kidney disease. Remember, early diagnosis can improve treatment options and their outcomes. Let’s take a look at the kidney function tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="31131799" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="creatinine-blood-test" source="keywords"&gt;Creatinine blood test&lt;/keyword&gt; &amp;amp; eGFR&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Your kidneys filter waste from the blood. The easiest way to estimate how well they are doing this is via the blood creatinine test and the eGFR. “Creatinine alone is just a number. eGFR tells how much the kidneys are working,” the doctor said. eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) provides the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.va.gov/EKIDNEYCLINIC/rooms/laboratory/topics/creatinine-and-egfr/index.asp" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;percentage of your kidney function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cystatin C&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cystatin C is a protein produced by the cells in your body. When the kidneys work well, the cystatin C levels in your blood will be normal. However, when the kidney suffers, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/cystatin-c" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;the level of cystatin C goes up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, according to the National Kidney Foundation. “If you work out, take supplements, have a lot of muscle, or use creatinine, then creatinine can be misleading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where cystatin C can provide a more accurate measure of your kidney health,” the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Urine dipstick test&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before your kidney function starts to decline, your body will give you signs. This can manifest as leakage of protein into the urine. A simple urine dipstick can detect such leaks. According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, this test is quick. The healthcare provider will place a strip of chemically treated paper, called a dipstick, into the urine sample. The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/chronic-kidney-disease-ckd/tests-diagnosis" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;dipstick changes colour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; if albumin is present in the urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Urine protein-to-creatinine ratio&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the nephrologist, a urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) test looks at how much protein is leaking from the kidney into your urine. Higher-than-average levels may be a sign of a kidney-related issue. This test is done by collecting the urine sample and then analysing its protein-to-creatinine ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bottom line&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once these test results come back and indicate abnormalities, you must book an appointment. Follow this simple rule: if urine PCR is raised, creatinine is increasing, or there is blood in the dipstick, see a nephrologist. “Diet, turmeric milk, detox, and home remedies won't work here,” Dr Sabharwal emphasised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

Strong currents rush around its edges, but inside the ring, the surface settles into long, smooth swells. This region has no coastline or islands, yet it has a name: the Sargasso Sea, a part of the ocean that behaves differently from the water around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the surface, golden‑brown seaweed called &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sargassum-seaweed-is-a-deadly-obstacle-course-for-baby-sea-turtles/"&gt;Sargassum&lt;/a&gt; gathers into loose mats. Tiny gas‑filled bladders keep the seaweed afloat, so it rides the waves instead of sinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shrimp, bright juvenile fish, pale crabs, and many other creatures move through this tangle, using it as food, shelter, or both. The Sargasso Sea is the only sea named after a plant rather than a coastline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sargasso-sea-sailor-stories"&gt;Sargasso Sea sailor stories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before satellites or ocean sensors, sailors noticed this unusual water. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Christopher Columbus&lt;/a&gt; described the fear of being becalmed in 1492 when he wrote that the ships might “never again feel a breath of wind.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crews did not know that the calm surface hid a powerful system of currents below. They were sailing across the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Gyre" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;North Atlantic subtropical gyre&lt;/a&gt; – a huge loop of water that draws in water from many latitudes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These currents corral floating material and keep it in place. That pattern helps explain why Sargassum gathers here and why this sea has such a distinct character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sargasso-sea-plants-and-animals"&gt;Sargasso Sea plants and animals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From above, the Sargasso Sea looks like an 800-mile-wide &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/sargassosea.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plant nursery&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists call the drifting mats “habitat islands” because the seaweed provides shade, hiding places, and food sources all in one package at the ocean surface. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many animals that would otherwise be exposed in the open water can tuck into this cover and avoid predators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/discover-fish/species-profiles/porbeagle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Porbeagle sharks&lt;/a&gt; cruise along the dim edges of the mats, while Bermuda storm‑petrels sweep just above the water, grabbing shrimp and small fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys have counted more than 100 invertebrate species clinging to Sargassum, living their entire lives on these drifting clumps until the mats finally break apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European and American eels begin their lives beneath &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sargassum-seaweed-a-growing-problem-could-become-a-sustainable-solution/"&gt;Sargassum&lt;/a&gt; mats as transparent larvae. They ride the ocean currents westward or eastward, depending on the species. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, they grow, change shape, and slip into rivers that can reach as far inland as Indiana, where they may live for decades in freshwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they reach maturity, these eels swim back out to sea and make the 3,000‑mile journey to the Sargasso Sea to spawn once and die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They return to the same broad region where they started, even though there are no obvious visual landmarks to guide them. This ability still puzzles zoologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-calm-patch-and-climate"&gt;Calm patch and climate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sargasso Sea is also plays a part in Earth’s climate system. In summer, the surface warms to about 82–86 °F; in winter, it cools to roughly 64–68 °F. Warm, salty water moves northward, while cooler water returns south. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exchange helps steady weather patterns on both sides of the Atlantic by shaping how heat and moisture move through the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The open water also absorbs carbon dioxide from the air, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plankton-change-their-cell-chemistry-to-survive-warming-oceans/"&gt;tiny plankton&lt;/a&gt; use that carbon to build shells. When they die, many of those shells sink to the seafloor, carrying the carbon with them and keeping it out of the atmosphere for long periods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the 1950s, researchers near Bermuda have recorded conditions in these waters. The long record shows that, since the 1980s, the average temperature here has climbed by roughly 1 °C, or about 1.8 °F. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmer surface layers resist vertical mixing, so oxygen has a harder time reaching depth, and nutrients from below do not rise as easily to feed plankton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These measurements, combined with data from drifting Argo floats and satellite color scans, make the Sargasso Sea a key site for studying ocean acidification in the open Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-atlantic-ocean-fish-trap"&gt;Atlantic Ocean fish trap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sargasso Sea sits at the center of several major surface currents, so today this calm region collects floating debris from across the North Atlantic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These looping flows pull in plastic bags, bottle caps, and abandoned fishing gear and hold them in the rotating water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One survey estimated roughly 200,000 &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/great-pacific-garbage-patch-so-large-that-dozens-of-species-call-it-home/"&gt;pieces of debris&lt;/a&gt; per square kilometer – about 518,000 pieces per square mile – spread over several hundred miles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underwater microphones pick up the growl of cargo vessels as they cut straight through Sargassum mats. That noise can mask the low‑frequency calls of sperm whales passing beneath, and floating nets tangled in the weed can trap juvenile turtles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/11/28130808/sargasso-sea_bermuda-triangle_map_1m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/11/28130814/sargasso-sea_bermuda-triangle_map_1s.webp" alt="Location map of the island of Bermuda and the Sargasso Sea.

If the Sargasso Sea lost its special conditions, rivers from Newfoundland to the Gulf of Mexico would send eels to the ocean only for them to search in vain for a birthplace erased by heat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humpback whales might arrive in spring to find feeding areas stripped of their usual prey. Storm tracks over Europe could shift, and the Atlantic might store even more of the planet’s excess heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For something that looks like an empty patch of blue on a map, the Sargasso Sea plays a large role in Earth’s climate and marine life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The still water sends a clear message: we need to protect this calm region, or be prepared for more intense and less predictable changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2023.1289931/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frontiers in Marine Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 22:14:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxObC1penhESHVKbVlmM0NwTng0elMxLWMtZ21KaTBrV3hzSzR0R1RyZ0x3YTNVNnZlNU9pN01Jdm5ZWW9jSy1VS1F3Y0lCa1BKVXBXakVpTGt0SFNwVDkwYXdCY2RCbnc5d2RUeks4NS0wZm96YmdJS0wyblJtV0pRUERWRGFBdkpVMXp3d0FlUEZkSXhmOGc2Sjl2ZGJ0c0ZMdXFvRQ</guid></item><item><title>Louise Newson博士：真正令人不安的是对女性的伤害-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/dr-louise-newson-menopause-clinic-panorama-pgpxpctdl</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Louise Newson is in a glum mood when we first meet. She came to London for a BBC &lt;i&gt;Woman’s Hour&lt;/i&gt; interview about research she had funded into potential links between the menopause, depression and suicide, but is early for our rendezvous, having been pulled from the programme at the last minute. “I’ve come to expect it,” she says. “It’s disheartening, but not surprising.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Until recently Newson, one of the country’s best known menopause experts, was a fixture in the media. She had a regular slot on &lt;i&gt;This Morning&lt;/i&gt;, and her free Balance app had more than a million downloads. Now, after what she calls an “annus horribilis” in which &lt;i&gt;Panorama&lt;/i&gt; accused Newson’s private clinic of increasing the cancer risk to patients by prescribing&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; high dosages of hormones, and a timely leak that the leading professional body for menopause medics had stripped her of specialist status, Newson’s reputation has taken a severe dent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Newson Health, her private practice, which has two centres in Stratford-upon-Avon and London, had been seeing about 4,000 patients a month but that figure slumped. She had to make 26 out of 70 doctors redundant, and slash the amount of menopause research she was able to fund. A pending professorship at a university was dropped, most of her media appearances were cancelled, and the Care Quality Commission (CQC) announced an inspection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/dr-louise-newson-tells-of-menopause-witch-hunt-9fzmmr38r" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr Louise Newson tells of ‘menopause witch-hunt’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I have been to some very dark places,” Newson confesses while sipping chamomile tea in an upmarket bar off Chancery Lane in central London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“It has been very difficult for me. But what really upsets me is the harm to women. Many of them can’t get what they need. I’ve never said hormones are a cure-all. But we shouldn’t be so scared of them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;When we speak weeks later, Newson appears much more upbeat. She bounces on to a Zoom call with a big grin, hair immaculate as ever, and framed medical certificates on the wall of her study behind her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;She explains that she has been buoyed after meeting a couple at a conference who thanked her for her weekly podcast, which discusses menopause issues and treatment and has had nearly nine million downloads. “The husband said, ‘It’s our anniversary today. Two years ago, my wife thought she had dementia [menopause can cause memory loss]. It’s only due to your podcast that she looked into hormones. Now she’s on HRT, our whole life is transformed.’ And I remind myself, it’s not a placebo, it’s not a coincidence. Those sorts of encounters are really humbling. Women are making choices with my information, and I think that’s really important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Yes, the last year has been awful, but I’ve dealt with really hard things in my life before. Like when my dad died [Newson was only nine]. And I’ve made this unwritten rule to myself that nothing is worse than your father dying. So you’ve just got to keep going.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Besides, she says with a peal of laughter, her three daughters, aged 14, 21, and 23, won’t let her quit. &lt;br&gt;“They say, ‘You get back out there.’ I respond that ‘no, I can’t do it. I just want to stay at home and make cakes.’ And they tell me, ‘You carry on, because you’re making a difference.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/the-app-for-gps-promising-to-revolutionise-menopause-care-gjn7zzx5n" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The app for GPs promising to revolutionise menopause care&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Before her fall from grace, Newson was lauded as the doctor who kick-started the menopause revolution. When she founded her clinic in 2018, 1.3 million women in England took hormone replacement therapy, a treatment designed to replace oestrogen and progestogen, which decrease during the menopause. Her campaign for greater awareness of the benefits of HRT, alongside personalities including Davina McCall and &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/mariella-frostrup-why-is-menopause-still-taboo-fd2krgc7z" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;Mariella Frostrup&lt;/a&gt;, has driven a surge in prescriptions to 2.8 million last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="2.12"&gt;&lt;div id="6c7ddb7d-7bc7-4b9e-88e1-77d04250441e"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Davina McCall discusses the menopause with Newson on ITV’s Loose Women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;ITV/SHUTTERSTOCK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Newson, 55, had not intended to make female hormones her career. A self-described “girly swot” who achieved a distinction in exams, Newson trained as a hospital physician and initially wanted to become an oncologist, but decided it was not compatible with family life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“I couldn’t find a female role model in the hospital who was happily married,” she says. “They were single, or divorced, or they had back-to-back childcare and never saw their children. And I wanted my daughters to know me.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Newson, who also has a first-class honours degree in pathology, went into general practice and produced books on evidence-based medicine. She says she realised women suffering a variety of symptoms for menopause and the perimenopause transition period — from physical changes including hot flushes to mental changes such as mood swings and anxiety — were simply not getting the right help. Many were fobbed off, she claims, or &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/a-generation-of-women-over-50-stuck-taking-antidepressants-sdfj8dlcz" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;given antidepressants&lt;/a&gt; with serious side-effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;About a decade ago, when she began getting night sweats and headaches and experiencing low mood, a gynaecologist explained her oestrogen was extremely low and, with the ordinary daily dose of 100 micrograms, her body was not absorbing enough to make a difference. Her dose was gradually tripled to 300mcg, and her symptoms improved. She opened her clinic the next year, charging from £195 per appointment and promising women “unbiased, evidence-based information” to support their hormonal health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Newson Health quickly became known as being more proactive in prescribing HRT, which is given as pills, patches or gels, and more willing to give higher dosages than many NHS GPs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="1a6ac307-566f-46e2-aad1-954052a9bb80" class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Heart of the controversy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This is where we get to the heart of the controversy. Under guidelines from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the highest recommended daily dose of oestrogen is 100mcg when delivered in patches, or its equivalent in tablets or gels. Practitioners are allowed to give higher dosages where necessary. Many specialists do. But the risk of cancer associated with HRT has put many GPs off moving above 100mcg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A 2002 study linked combined HRT (with both oestrogen and progestogen) to breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and blood clots, leading to panic and widespread abandonment of the treatment. While the dial has since shifted to widespread acceptance that the benefits of HRT outweigh these risks, many experts caution against long periods of higher amounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Channa Jayasena, a consultant endocrinologist and lecturer at Imperial College London, says: “The higher doses have not been explored for their ability to add value to the low doses. We know in medicine that more isn’t always better, and more can be dangerous … it’s not a desirable thing to do unless you have a good reason.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Newson firmly disagrees. There is unlikely to ever be a randomised controlled study on higher doses due to ethical and funding considerations, but she says the medical fraternity needs to look at other evidence. She points to peer-reviewed observational studies of women placed on higher dosages that call into question the claims of higher risk. She also emphasises that the risk of cancer is based on tests of synthetic hormones rather than the body-identical drugs she prescribes, which have the same chemical structure as hormones produced naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="884b1ec7-f3e9-450c-8b81-b312c2cd8b00" class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;The oestrogen/progesterone row&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Experts say matching oestrogen and progesterone is crucial because on its own higher doses of the former can lead to bleeding and thickened womb lining, which can be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Newson says she will prescribe higher oestrogen without automatically increasing progesterone, in consultation with the patient, if it is necessary to improve symptoms. She points to a recent peer-reviewed study of 200 of her private patients, which showed no increased risk in women on body-identical HRT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;She says some women need higher doses because they do not absorb the oestrogen from patches and gels. “If I’m prescribing at 300mcg they won’t necessarily get that amount in their body. You could literally fill a bath of oestrogen gel with 100,000 times the maximum dose … I could sit in it and none of it would absorb in my body.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Critics of Newson highlight that as many as one in four patients at her private clinics are given oestrogen at higher doses. “Women come to me after they have tried the NHS … and can’t get the right dosages,” she says. “It’s not surprising.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="623c3ed8-d58e-4fd9-9a12-af7aeb98d053" class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Battle with British Menopause Society&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;As Newson’s profile rose, she found herself pitted against the British Menopause Society (BMS), a charity that provides education and guidance to medics. In 2023 the BMS and five other bodies, including the Royal College of GPs, issued an alert that oestrogen “should not be regularly prescribed in doses higher than the upper limit” due to safety risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Panorama&lt;/i&gt; programme in September last year, which involved two trustees and one specialist member of the BMS, revealed that Newson had been taken off its specialist register because of concerns over her practice. One former patient said she developed endometrial hyperplasia, a thickening of the womb lining that can be a precursor to cancer. She was one of more than a dozen Newson Health patients who made allegations to the BBC about complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Newson says “anyone can have cancer, but that does not mean that the hormones have caused it”. She points out that when one of the patients from the programme complained to the GMC the case was quickly dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There are “literally thousands of patients who have been happy with their treatment”, Newson says. She has passed her required annual appraisal as a doctor and a separate complaint to the GMC about Newson personally was also rapidly dismissed. The CQC inspection is continuing; the process was restarted after one of the inspectors was linked to the BMS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Although Ofcom dismissed a complaint by Newson about &lt;i&gt;Panorama&lt;/i&gt;, she maintains that she is experiencing a “witch-hunt” because she has challenged orthodoxy, and that organisations such as the BMS are too risk-adverse. She says she was astounded when a subject access request — a formal application for personal data held by an organisation — showed BMS trustees had exchanged dozens of emails about her work, describing her as an irritant and the “Joan of Arc of menopause”. The BMS says the messages have been taken out of context, and that it acted on legitimate concerns by removing Newson from its specialist register. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Newson counters that many of her views are being taken out of context too. She says she increases dosages only when “absolutely necessary” and routinely advises patients on other options. “People think I’ve got some fixation with hormones, but I can just see the benefits. I advise on exercise, nutrition and lifestyle changes as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;She also feels dismissed by those in the medical profession who believe she is “just a GP” rather than a specialist. “I wrote four books on evidence-based medicine and worked as an academic. I have read literally every paper out there on this subject . The word on the street is that I’m this maverick doctor, and it’s simply not true. I collect my data and I publish more in peer-reviewed journals than any other menopause clinic in the world on original research. And I’m actually a really careful, cautious doctor. But I do want to help women get what they need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="538ead7e-e048-42e2-a5db-a5bdbde57574" class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;Louise Rachel Newson: curriculum vitae&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Born&lt;/b&gt; August 11, 1970&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Education &lt;/b&gt;Pathology and medicine degrees from University of Manchester&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Career&lt;/b&gt; GP in Solihull, Birmingham, from 2003 to 2018; writer and editor at GP Magazine for over 20 years, alongside other work in medical publishing.

			&lt;p&gt;A single, half-hour session of moderate exercise is enough to confer an immediate mood-boosting effect, and now scientists have figured out why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice – and likely humans – that boost comes from the release of a hormone called adiponectin, which travels into the brain and sparks activity in a region associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/feeling-happy-and-sad-heres-how-our-brains-manage-mixed-emotions"&gt;emotional regulation&lt;/a&gt;. The result is a lift in mood that could hang around for hours, although the duration has yet to be measured in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some pretty incredible implications here. For &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/treatment-for-depression-changes-the-very-structure-of-the-brain-scientists-find"&gt;people who &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; exercise&lt;/a&gt;, even one workout could offer immediate relief for symptoms of anxiety or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="183019" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same mechanism could inspire a class of new, fast-acting antidepressant drugs that take effect much more quickly than traditional treatments such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-antidepressants-may-have-another-surprising-effect-on-your-brain"&gt;SSRIs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-melancholia-depression-can-be-diagnosed-by-facial-expression"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Severe 'Melancholia' Depression Can Be Diagnosed by Facial Expression&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rapid-acting antidepressant treatments that offer sustained effects and minimal side effects remain scarce," neurobiologist Sonata Suk-yu Yau of Hong Kong Polytechnic University &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/scientists-identify-a-fat-derived-hormone-that-drives-the-mood-benefits-of-exercise/"&gt;told Psypost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study provides clinical evidence for the effectiveness of a single session of exercise in alleviating depressive symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing physical activity is widely recognized as a means of both &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-new-study-shows-why-exercise-should-be-the-first-choice-in-treating-depression"&gt;treating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-hour-of-exercise-a-week-can-be-enough-to-prevent-depression"&gt;preventing&lt;/a&gt; mild to moderate depression. However, not much is known about the effects of a single bout of moderate exercise – a nice jog, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence seems to suggest &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2022.102172"&gt;that bursts of exercise&lt;/a&gt; have a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0000000000001321"&gt;positive effect&lt;/a&gt; on individuals with depression; Yau and her colleagues wanted to quantify that effect and identify the reason behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recruited 40 adult humans between the ages of 18 and 40, and a few dozen mice across multiple experimental groups, and got them to work exercising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The humans were the easy part. Each participant filled out a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile_of_mood_states"&gt;Profile of Mood States&lt;/a&gt; survey to assess their mood. Then, they ran on a treadmill for 30 minutes while wearing a heart rate monitor. After exercising, they immediately retook the survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants both with and without symptoms of anxiety and depression demonstrated a significant mood lift, with symptomatic participants reporting lower anger, confusion, fatigue, depression, and anxiety overall. Meanwhile, esteem and vigor rose across all participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To figure out why, the researchers turned to the mice. This is where it becomes unpleasant. To induce depression-like symptoms, some of the animals were put through several weeks of a protocol called chronic unpredictable stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means the mice are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2015.00006"&gt;subjected to prolonged exposure&lt;/a&gt; to a variety of inconsistent and unpredictable stressors, such as wet bedding, restraint, a tilted cage, or holding a mouse's foot to an electrified pad for five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It results in reductions in grooming behavior, exploration, and curiosity, and an increase in immobility when put through physical tests, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2024.149123"&gt;similar to symptoms of depression in humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some mice were not subjected to this protocol to serve as the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the mice were given a similar burst of moderate exercise on a treadmill, and their behavior was assessed. It worked: both stressed and unstressed mice showed behaviors associated with an elevated mood, including grooming and increased mobility, and spent a longer time attempting to swim when placed in water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects were measured at 2 hours post-exercise, and persisted for at least 24 hours; by 48 hours, the effects had subsided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To figure out why, the researchers euthanized freshly exercised mice and studied them. They found higher levels of a hormone called adiponectin in both the blood and the medial prefrontal cortex of the mice after exercise, a region of the brain that includes the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cingulate_cortex"&gt;anterior cingulate cortex&lt;/a&gt;, a crucial region for emotion regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging and mapping revealed that adiponectin switches on a receptor in certain neurons called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiponectin_receptor_1"&gt;AdipoR1&lt;/a&gt;; knocking out that receptor in those neurons in another mouse cohort eradicated the behaviors associated with a positive mood boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On further investigation, the researchers found AdipoR1 activates a protein called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APPL1"&gt;APPL1&lt;/a&gt; that moves into the neuron's nucleus, triggering a cascade of molecular changes that help build or strengthen synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These neurons also formed new &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_spine"&gt;dendritic spines&lt;/a&gt; – an effect that disappeared when APPL1 was blocked – suggesting that they, too, play a role in the mood-boosting effects of exercise. A similar dendritic disinhibition is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13809-8"&gt;triggered by ketamine&lt;/a&gt;, which could hold some clues about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key here, however, seems to be the activation of AdipoR1 – it's like the switch that turns on that post-exercise bliss-out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That suggests a strong target for therapeutic intervention; indeed, scientists have been investigating the potential of synthetic adiponectin receptor agonist &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines13081867"&gt;AdipoRon as a treatment for depression&lt;/a&gt;, although it has not yet been tested in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the study does show a clear mechanism for the mood boost conferred by a workout, suggesting that exercise may be a valid treatment regimen for individuals who struggle with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-drug-might-offer-hope-for-those-with-difficult-to-treat-depression"&gt;finding an appropriate medication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, our objective is to develop population-based guidelines with optimal single-bout exercise prescriptions for mood improvement, serving as an effective strategy to prevent the development of depression," &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/scientists-identify-a-fat-derived-hormone-that-drives-the-mood-benefits-of-exercise/"&gt;Yau said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03317-1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Beyond its comforting taste, black tea offers a variety of health benefits that extend far beyond its well-known caffeine content. Derived from the Camellia sinensis plant, black tea undergoes an oxidation process that transforms its natural compounds, enhancing both colour and flavour while creating powerful antioxidants. These plant compounds have been linked to improved immunity, heart and gut health, blood sugar regulation, mental clarity, and even hydration. Regularly enjoying black tea can be an easy, enjoyable addition to a balanced lifestyle, supporting overall wellness while delivering a warming, satisfying daily ritual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6 surprising ways black tea supports your health&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Supports immunity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black tea contains plant compounds with antioxidant properties that can enhance immune function. Antioxidants help neutralise free radicals in the body, reducing cellular damage, inflammation, and the risk of chronic diseases. The oxidation process that black tea undergoes increases the formation of these protective compounds. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40456886/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in PubMed Central&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that consuming a greater variety of flavonoid-rich foods, including black tea, may reduce all-cause mortality and the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases by 6–20%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly enjoying black tea can therefore be a simple, daily way to support long-term immune health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Black Tea vs Black Coffee: Which is healthier?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Improves mental focus and alertness&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black tea is often chosen for a morning caffeine boost. It contains both caffeine and an amino acid called L-theanine, which together can enhance alertness and cognitive performance while promoting mental clarity. This combination has been shown in research to support sustained focus and attention, making black tea an effective choice for improving mental sharpness throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Enhances heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The polyphenols in black tea are linked to improved cardiovascular health. Drinking two cups daily can provide 400–600 milligrams of flavan-3-ols, a recommended amount for supporting heart function. These compounds help maintain healthy cholesterol levels and regulate blood pressure. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that black tea supplementation significantly reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to control treatments. Incorporating black tea into a balanced diet may therefore support heart health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Regulates blood sugar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black tea may play a role in maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. Some studies suggest that it can improve glucose metabolism and support insulin sensitivity, which are key factors in preventing type 2 diabetes. Regular black tea consumption has also been linked to a lower risk of developing this condition. While it should not replace medical treatment or a structured dietary plan, drinking black tea can be a beneficial addition to lifestyle strategies aimed at regulating blood sugar and supporting metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Supports gut health&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging research highlights black tea’s positive effects on the gut microbiome, and its consumption promotes beneficial intestinal bacteria, improving overall gut health. A healthy gut flora is crucial for digestive function, immune response, and even brain health. By supporting the microbiome, black tea may indirectly contribute to better digestion, enhanced immune function, and improved cognitive wellbeing. For those looking to nurture their gut, incorporating black tea into daily routines can be a simple, enjoyable approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Contributes to hydration&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite containing caffeine, black tea can help meet daily hydration needs. Moderate consumption provides fluids that generally outweigh caffeine’s mild diuretic effect. Both caffeinated and decaffeinated black tea count towards total fluid intake, making it a hydrating beverage choice. However, moderation is key, as excessive intake could lead to side effects like insomnia or a rapid heartbeat. Evidence shows that consuming up to eight cups of black tea per day does not negatively affect hydration, offering a tasty way to support fluid balance alongside water and other beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black tea offers a range of health benefits that extend well beyond its caffeine content. From supporting immunity and heart health to enhancing focus, regulating blood sugar, nurturing the gut, and contributing to hydration, this traditional beverage proves that its value goes far beyond flavour. Incorporating black tea into a balanced daily routine can be an easy, enjoyable step toward overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Neuroscience now shows that the patterns one repeats each day quietly sculpts neural pathways that influence how sharply they think, how quickly they learn, and how resilient they stay under stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, not every repeated habit can provide the same results, and only certain forms of consistency stimulate the neural circuits. Recently, AIIMS-trained Neurosurgeon Dr Arun L Naik (@doclogues), shared 10 best habits that, when done consistently, can make you smarter. Dr Arun says, “The brain thrives on repetition. When you do a task repeatedly, your neurons fire in the same pattern over and over.” He adds, “Neurons that fire together, wire together”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 creative activities to boost brain power, sharpen memory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10 habits that help build a smarter brain &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1.

The treatment itself can cause incontinence and impotence, which can significantly affect quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Balanced against that, finding cancers early and treating them can save lives. But it's difficult for doctors to work out which cancers are going to be aggressive and spread, which means men can be treated unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The committe said the number of lives saved by screening does not outweigh its harmful effects on healthy men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Why not screen all high-risk men?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Many predicted that all men at high risk of the disease were likely to be included in new screening plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the committee stopped short of that recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Despite black men having twice the risk of prostate cancer, it said there should be no screening for black men due to "uncertainties" around its impact, and a lack of evidence from clinical trials in these men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It also recommended no screening for men with a family history of the disease, for the same reason -

					&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev are now saying that while weight loss in middle age could help the waistline, it may also hurt the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that after diet-induced obesity in middle-aged mice, weight loss lowered blood glucose, which is a positive benefit. However, it also caused aggravated inflammation in the hypothalamus, a region in the brain that regulates appetite, energy balance and many other vital functions. Similar inflammation is known to be linked to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study, led by MD-PhD student Alon Zemer and Dr. Alexandra Tsitrina at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, under the supervision of Faculty of Health Sciences Prof. Assaf Rudich of the Obesity Research Lab and Prof. Alon Monsonego of the Neuroimmunology Lab, recently appeared in the peer-reviewed journal, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-025-01933-x"&gt;Gero-Science.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unexpected findings raise new questions about how weight loss in midlife may impact brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œWeight loss remains essential for restoring metabolic health in obesity,â€� Zemer told The Times of Israel in a teleconference call with Rudich. â€œBut we need to understand the impact of weight loss on the mid-age brain and ensure brain health is not compromised.â€�&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Skinny on weight loss: Israeli researchers warn dieting in middle age may harm the brain"&gt;

	&lt;p class="newsletter-error newsletter-article-error"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;People in their middle age â€œare increasingly likely to try and lose weight by dieting, with anti-obesity medications, or surgery,â€� Rudich said. â€œThe findings show that we need to make sure we are not igniting an unwanted inflammatory response in the brain during the active phase of losing weight.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Studies about weight gain, but not weight loss&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that 64 percent of Israelis are &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/tel-aviv-university-study-argues-third-of-normal-weight-israelis-are-secretly-obese/"&gt;overweight&lt;/a&gt; or obese according to World Health Organization standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Rudich said that he and Zemer found that most basic research using mouse models largely ignored the investigation of what happens to the body after weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;â€œMost of the line of research is about young mice gaining weight,â€� he said. â€œWe wanted to look at processes occurring during weight loss instead of weight gain, and specifically in older individuals.â€�&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3695344" class="wp-caption  alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/assaf_rudich_2-e1763889307777.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-vertical wp-image-3695344" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/assaf_rudich_2-e1763889307777-300x480.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers monitored the weight gain and loss of young mice, similar to 20-year-old humans, as well as middle-aged mice, comparable to individuals aged approximately 40 years or older. (One mouse year is equivalent to 40 human years.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œWe gave them a high-fat diet and they were gaining weight really nicely,â€� said Zemer. â€œThey almost doubled their weight following eight weeks of this diet. We just let them eat as much as they wanted. Following these eight weeks, we reversed it. Half of the high-fat group went back to a controlled diet, and we let them lose weight, kind of naturally.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists said that both the younger and older mice lost weight quickly. Their bodies became healthier, with blood sugar levels returning to normal in both groups. Since high blood sugar can lead to diabetes, lowering it benefits the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The older mice lost almost 60% of the extra weight they had gained. However, when the scientists looked closely at their brains, they found neuroinflammation of the microglia, the brainâ€™s immune cells. The microglia regulate brain development and neuronal networks.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3695400" class="wp-caption  aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/52525.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3695400" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/52525-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;From left, the microglia from middle-aged mice. Obesity increases the volume and structural complexity of the cells. During weight loss, instead of reverting to the lean stateâ€™s structure, cells were further inflamed. (Courtesy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œThe middle-aged brain appears to be sensitive to this weight loss, and during the period of losing weight, responds with increased neuroinflammation beyond that already triggered by obesity,â€� Zemer said. â€œAnd this is something that occurs in mid-age but is not apparent in young adult mice.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;h3&gt;Studying the changes on the molecular and structural levels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tsitrina said that high-advanced microscopy and image analysis with advanced computational analysis enabled the detection of sensitive changes in the microglia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She explained that the study showed the body’s adaptive response to weight loss through two complementary dimensions: on a molecular level, by examining signals inside the cells, and on a structural level, by examining the shape and activity of the brain cells. These findings have â€œpotential health ramifications,â€� she said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3695393" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/IMG_153103.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3695393" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/IMG_153103-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;From left: young and middle-aged mice were fed an obesity-inducing diet for eight weeks, and the weight loss group was switched back to the normal diet. The pie charts show that instead of reversing obesity-induced genes, most genes in the hypothalamus aggravate the effect of obesity during active weight loss (red).

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers understand that people want to â€œrelieve the risks associated with obesity,â€� said Rudich. â€œBut we need to test it closely because sometimes we come up with surprising results that make us think in new directions. So, research not only provides answers, but it also brings up new questions.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œThe study demonstrated that not all weight loss is alike,â€� said Dr. Amir Tirosh of Sheba Medical Centerâ€™s Endocrinology and Diabetes Research Center, who is not connected to the study.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3695363" class="wp-caption  alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1534.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-vertical wp-image-3695363" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1534-300x480.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Dr. Amir Tirosh of the Endocrinology and Diabetes Research Center at Sheba Medical Center. (Courtesy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a written reply to The Times of Israel, Tirosh said that since the study uses a mouse model and needs to be validated in humans, â€œwe will need more studies to understand the long-term effects of this remaining brain inflammation.â€�&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemer said that the research team is now embarking on a new study to look at different areas of the hypothalamus and to try to gain an even deeper understanding of what is happening with these cells, and what processes can or cannot be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œWe want to understand what happens when people lose weight and then, six months later, gain back every single pound they lost during this time,â€� Zemer said. â€œDo we get any beneficial effect from this weight loss? Or, is it somehow preferable to be weight-stable? Do we gain health benefits by being lean or less obese, even if it is temporary, for several years only?â€�&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â€œWeight loss requires further investigation,â€� said Rudich. â€œWe might need to take action to try and protect the middle-aged brain when attempting to treat obesity.â€�&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As the years pass, it can become harder to get a good night's rest. The most common sleep disorder in middle-aged and older adults is chronic insomnia, which for many translates to around three years of relatively sleepless nights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests a popular, gentle exercise may improve sleep as effectively as the top insomnia therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong University exercise physiologist Parco M. Siu and colleagues compared the first-line treatment for this sleep disorder, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), with regular sessions of tai chi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of people around the world practice tai chi, a low-impact martial art that originated in China, often referred to as 'meditation in motion'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-form-of-exercise-improves-sleep-the-most-study-finds"&gt;One Form of Exercise Improves Sleep The Most, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that science has shown &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-form-of-exercise-improves-sleep-the-most-study-finds"&gt;similar styles of exercise&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-ways-to-get-a-better-night-s-sleep-according-to-science"&gt;as well as meditation and mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;) can benefit sleep, researchers suspected tai chi may be a useful companion to existing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study recruited 200 ethnic-Chinese adults who were above the age of 50 and lived in Hong Kong. All participants had been diagnosed with chronic insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were prescribed a course of 24, one-hour group sessions of either CBT-I or tai chi (the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-form_tai_chi"&gt;24-form Yang style&lt;/a&gt;, to be specific) with 100 people assigned to each group. Sessions of either CBT-I or tai chi were held twice a week, for three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183326" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183326" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi-insomnia.jpg" alt="bar graphs show lower remission and response rate in tai chi group than cbt group in month 3, but equivalent remission and response rates for both treatments by month 15" class="size-full wp-image-183326" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183326" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Insomnia remission rate and treatment response rate for CBT-I and tai chi. (Siu et al., &lt;em&gt;BMJ,&lt;/em&gt; 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of these treatments, the CBT-I group reported a greater reduction in their insomnia symptoms than those in the tai chi group, with changes assessed using a common seven-question screening tool called the Insomnia Severity Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the researchers assessed participants again 15 months later, the tai chi group had 'caught up', enjoying improvements in sleep quality and duration, quality of life, mental health, and physical activity level that were on par with the CBT-I group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, 31 of the 85 tai chi participants who returned for the 15-month check-in had continued their tai chi practice after the intervention period, albeit at a lower frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, just 13 of the 82 CBT participants who returned for a follow-up assessment reported using the skills and knowledge they had acquired during their CBT sessions in the subsequent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that tai chi's accessibility and ease of integration into people's lifestyles may benefit its long-term effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic insomnia can have serious impacts on the body, placing individuals at a higher risk for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-insomnia-linked-to-ultra-processed-foods-study-finds"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-neural-mechanism-linking-poor-sleep-depression"&gt;mental disorders&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-insomnia-may-spark-changes-in-the-brain-that-trigger-dementia"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important that people seek professional medical help for their chronic insomnia. CBT, unlike tai chi, has been proven to be an effective insomnia treatment with minimal side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But accessing CBT for insomnia can sometimes involve long waiting periods because of a scarcity of trained therapists, and depending on access to healthcare, appointments can be expensive or subsidized under limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183330" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183330" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi-642x361.jpg" alt="One Form of Exercise Can Improve Sleep Long Term, Study Finds" class="size-medium wp-image-183330" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/tai-chi.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183330" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Tai chi's accessibility and ease of integration into people's lifestyles may benefit its long-term effectiveness.

Unlike Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, it primarily affects individuals in low-income regions where malnutrition is widespread. Also called malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus (MRDM), Type 5 diabetes occurs when chronic nutrient deficiencies during childhood or early development impair the pancreas, reducing insulin production. This insufficiency leads to elevated blood sugar levels, a hallmark of diabetes. People with Type 5 diabetes often have low body weight and may show physical signs of prolonged undernutrition. Management typically involves insulin therapy, although researchers are investigating alternative treatments, including oral medications, to improve patient outcomes and offer more accessible options for those living in resource-limited areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding Type 5 diabetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 5 diabetes occurs when chronic malnutrition during childhood or early development hampers proper pancreatic growth. The pancreas is the organ responsible for producing insulin, a hormone essential for regulating blood sugar levels. When pancreatic development is impaired, insulin production is insufficient, resulting in elevated blood sugar levels, a hallmark of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officially recognised by the International Diabetes Federation in 2025, Type 5 diabetes affects an estimated 20 to 25 million people worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition is most common in regions with high rates of malnutrition, particularly parts of Asia and Africa. Scientists are actively investigating ways to improve the diagnosis and treatment of this unique form of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms and signs of Type 5 diabetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased thirst&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frequent urination&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blurred vision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headaches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slow-healing cuts and wounds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low body mass index (BMI below 18.5)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Impaired skeletal growth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enlarged salivary glands&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changes in skin or hair texture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Type 5 diabetes causes and risk factors&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary cause of Type 5 diabetes is believed to be chronic undernutrition during critical periods of growth. Inadequate intake of essential nutrients during childhood or in utero can interfere with pancreatic development, leading to lifelong insulin insufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People at risk often have a documented history of malnutrition and present with low BMI at a young age. Researchers continue to study the mechanisms linking nutrient deficiency to pancreatic dysfunction and subsequent diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Type 5 diabetes is different from other types&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 5 diabetes is distinct from Types 1 and 2 in several key ways. Unlike Type 1, which is an autoimmune condition where the body attacks insulin-producing cells, Type 5 arises from chronic undernutrition that prevents the pancreas from developing fully. Unlike Type 2, which is often linked to obesity and insulin resistance, Type 5 typically affects individuals who are underweight and have a history of malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another major difference is the age of onset. Type 5 usually develops before the age of 30, whereas Type 2 commonly appears in adulthood, and Type 1 can occur at any age. Additionally, people with Type 5 often do not have ketones in their urine at diagnosis, a feature commonly seen in Type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Complications and &lt;keyword id="31100674" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="diagnosis-of-Type-5-diabetes" source="keywords"&gt;diagnosis of Type 5 Diabetes&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 5 diabetes carries risks similar to other diabetes types, including cardiovascular disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, and eye complications. Early detection and proper management are crucial to prevent these long-term health consequences. Blood glucose testing remains the cornerstone of diabetes diagnosis, with readings above 200 mg/dL typically indicating diabetes. In higher-income countries, healthcare providers use additional tests such as glycated haemoglobin (A1C), urinalysis, and antibody screening to differentiate between diabetes types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In low- and middle-income regions, limited access to these advanced tests often leads to misdiagnosis, with Type 5 diabetes frequently mistaken for Type 1. Key distinguishing factors include a history of malnutrition, age under 30 at diagnosis, low BMI, and the absence of ketones in urine at the time of diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/what-is-wilsons-disease-understanding-its-causes-symptoms-and-lifelong-prevention-tips/articleshow/125619315.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;What is Wilson’s disease: Understanding its causes, symptoms, and lifelong prevention tips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>为什么患有癌症的男性应该更多地关注安吉丽娜·朱莉-《泰晤士报》</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/brca-gene-testing-prostate-6972k9khw</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-content-body" class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 kuowVf"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Most people had never heard of the BRCA gene until 2013, when the actress Angelina Jolie announced she had had a preventative mastectomy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Jolie, who lost her mother to ovarian cancer, revealed she had taken the decision to have both breasts removed after discovering she had a mutation to the BRCA1 gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Normal versions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes repair damaged DNA, which helps prevent tumours.

Most men only become aware of BRCA mutations if a female relative diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer has her DNA tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;NHS genetic testing is fairly limited: the health service has launched a BRCA testing programme for people with Jewish ancestry, who are six times more likely to carry faults in BRCA genes. People with a strong family history of cancer, particularly if relatives were diagnosed at a young age, can ask their GP for genetic testing, which involves a simple saliva swab to test DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Professor Sir Mike Richards, chair of the NSC, acknowledged the committee’s decision would lead to “more people being tested for BRCA”, as men become more aware of the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Women diagnosed with breast or ovarian should “communicate to their male relatives” if they had tested positive for BRCA, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;But some experts raised concerns that GPs would be inundated with demands for testing.

However, unless BRCA testing is expanded, there are thousands of men who will miss out on this screening programme.

Nearly 59 million lives have been saved by the measles vaccine since 2000, according to WHO’s analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The MMR vaccine gives long-term protection against measles, mumps, and rubella. MSD first launched a vaccine in the US in 1971 and the company currently remains one of the major manufacturers of the jab alongside GSK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the proportion of children receiving their first dose of measles increased in 2024 compared to 2023, the number of those receiving their second dose is still too low to stop transmission. According to WHO guidance, at least 95% coverage with two measles vaccine doses is required – this number stood at 76% globally in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite fewer deaths, measles cases are surging worldwide, with an estimated 11 million infections in 2024 – nearly 800,000 more than pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Children living in low- and middle-income countries are particularly at risk of the virus, though cases have resurged even in high-income countries that once eliminated it. This is because immunisation rates have dropped below the 95% threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of those hit by outbreaks in 2025 has been the US. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported the highest number of cases this year since measles was declared eliminated in the country in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The rise in cases has come amid a volatile vaccine landscape in the US. Health secretary Robert F Kennedy (RFK) Jr has alternated &lt;a href="https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/rfk-jr-shifts-stance-on-mmr-vaccine-amid-measles-deaths/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:between endorsing and shunning;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;between endorsing and shunning&lt;/a&gt; the MMR vaccine, a shot that is proven to provide strong immunity against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;RFK Jr &lt;a href="https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/vaccine-sceptics-among-new-members-hired-by-rfk-jr-for-cdcs-vaccine-panel/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:overhauled the CDC’s vaccine committee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;overhauled the CDC’s vaccine committee&lt;/a&gt; this year, replacing members with well-known vaccine sceptics and individuals who were critical of both the Covid-19 vaccines and related countermeasures such as lockdowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The WHO did not directly call out the stance of President Trump’s administration on vaccines, though did warn that growing global outbreaks signal weaknesses in immunisation strategies and health systems. The agency also said that the world’s goal to eliminate measles by 2030 “remains a distant one”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “Measles is the world's most contagious virus, and these data show once again how it will exploit any gap in our collective defences against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Measles does not respect borders, but when every child in every community is vaccinated against it, costly outbreaks can be avoided, lives can be saved, and this disease can be eliminated from entire nations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"WHO warns of immunisation strategy gaps amid measles outbreaks" was originally created and published by &lt;a href="https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/who-warns-of-immunisation-strategy-gaps-amid-measles-outbreaks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pharmaceutical Technology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Pharmaceutical Technology&lt;/a&gt;, a GlobalData owned brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

&lt;p&gt;It may sound a little gross, but your poop could hold the &lt;strong&gt;key to saving lives&lt;/strong&gt;. While many of us have been flushing it away without a second thought, feces are now in demand in the world of medical research.&lt;strong&gt; Stool banks&lt;/strong&gt;, like the ones popping up across the U.S., are collecting and processing human feces to treat severe gut diseases, and even &lt;strong&gt;paying donors for their trouble&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This emerging field, known as &lt;strong&gt;fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)&lt;/strong&gt;, is gaining traction as a way to treat chronic conditions. And believe it or not, it’s not just about fighting infections. Researchers are also looking at how fecal transplants might help treat autism, obesity, some cancers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Fecal Transplants: More Than Just Poop&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering: what’s the big deal about feces, anyway? Why are doctors and researchers suddenly so obsessed with it? It turns out that your gut is &lt;strong&gt;home to a whole community of microbes &lt;/strong&gt;that play a role in keeping you healthy. These &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/microbes-dug-tunnels-millions-years-ago/" data-type="post" data-id="83998"&gt;microbes&lt;/a&gt; help with everything from digestion to immune function, and when they get out of whack, it can lead to all sorts of health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on research featured in the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sjhc.london.on.ca/news-and-media/our-stories/secret-super-powers-of-poop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;St&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Joseph’s Health Care London&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) involves transferring healthy stool from a donor into someone with a diseased gut microbiome. The idea is to restore balance in the gut, which can help treat infections, inflammation, and other conditions. While FMT is most commonly used to treat&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6346998/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, there’s growing interest in its potential for treating a variety of other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-quote"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-quote"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The idea is to use it for ‘poo’ transplants, otherwise known as fecal microbiota transplantation,” explains Associate &lt;a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/nadeem-kaakoush" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professor Nadeem O. Kaakoush&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from UNSW Sydney. “That’s when poo products made from healthy donor poo are transplanted into another person to improve their health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Not All Poop is Created Equal&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone’s stool is up to the task. As much as researchers might like to use any available poop, there are &lt;strong&gt;some strict requirements for donors&lt;/strong&gt;. They have to be healthy and free of all kinds of nasties—viruses, parasites, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and so on. And even if someone looks perfectly healthy, their stool &lt;strong&gt;might not be good enough &lt;/strong&gt;to use for medical treatments. &lt;em&gt;Dr. Kaakoush&lt;/em&gt; also explained that the process of selecting donors is rigorous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-quote"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-quote"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we transplant poo, we want to make sure the donor is free from blood-borne viruses (such as HIV or hepatitis). We also want to make sure their poo is free from parasites, and disease-causing viruses and bacteria (such as &lt;em&gt;Clostridioides difficile&lt;/em&gt;) and certain antibiotic-resistant bacteria.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On top of that, donors &lt;strong&gt;must live close to a stool bank&lt;/strong&gt;, as fresh samples are crucial for&lt;strong&gt; transplant success&lt;/strong&gt;. Even with all these hoops to jump through, there’s still high demand for quality stool.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Donating Poop Could Pay Off&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As demand for fecal donations rises, stool banks are offering compensation for qualified donors. Some programs, like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodnatureprogram.com/how-it-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;GoodNature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;offer up to $1,500 a month for regular stool donations&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While that might seem like a strange way to earn a paycheck, it’s becoming more common as the medical field recognizes the importance of these donations. As &lt;em&gt;Dr. Kaakoush&lt;/em&gt; puts it:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-quote"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-quote"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “It is likely your donation will treat someone with recurrent &lt;em&gt;C. difficile&lt;/em&gt; infection. Otherwise, it would be used in a clinical trial or study to treat another important medical condition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-orally-administered-fecal-microbiota-product-prevention-recurrence-clostridioides" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; FDA&lt;/a&gt; has already approved two commercial FMT products—&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rebyota&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Vowst&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;—both designed to reduce recurrence of C. difficile infections. The success rates for these treatments are impressive, with &lt;em&gt;Rebyota&lt;/em&gt; showing a &lt;strong&gt;70.6% success rate &lt;/strong&gt;compared to 57.5% with a placebo. Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;Vowst&lt;/em&gt; helped reduce recurrence in high-risk patients to just &lt;strong&gt;12.4%&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-quote"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-quote"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re a long way from replicating the entire gut microbial community in the lab. So we have to rely on live microbial products made from donated poo as research moves from the laboratory bench to the clinic,” he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

Illness is predicted to spread faster, infect more people and put higher-risk groups at greater chance of being seriously ill or hospitalized. Doctors and public health experts are warning people to take precautions, including getting this year’s flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For RNA viruses, such as influenza, survival is equivalent to replication. Every time the virus replicates in a host cell, it presents an opportunity for a mutation to emerge. While viruses are technically not alive, it is their nature to mutate and evolve. Through these mutations, they can become more contagious, evade immunity, and become deadlier. This past summer, as flu season cooled down in the Northern Hemisphere, it intensified in the Southern Hemisphere, giving influenza A (H3N2) another opportunity to &lt;a href="https://substack.com/redirect/485d93a3-5a6b-4697-a61d-a92d662ca722?j=eyJ1Ijoibmt3diJ9.QCd34Vl08F0GMIfuCN7EU1qCRF49hjJPir_c-RIbijo"&gt;mutate&lt;/a&gt; — and it did. According to scientists, seven mutations occurred, positioning the Northern Hemisphere to head into a rough flu season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a small group that emerged since June, and since it emerged, it’s rapidly spreading and predominating in some countries so far in the Northern Hemisphere,” Dr. Wenqing Zhang, head of the World Health Organization’s Global Respiratory Threats Unit, said in a media briefing &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/WHO/videos/866160182749483/"&gt;this month&lt;/a&gt;, about the strain H3N2 subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rajendram Rajnarayanan, of the New York Institute of Technology campus in Jonesboro, Arkansas, told Salon via email that the mutations “reshaped the areas that antibodies recognize,” making previous immunity, including immunity induced by the flu vaccine, less effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Rajnarayanan said, this mutation’s significant antigenic drift, which is when the genes of a virus change, is “a real concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have a narrow window to act — boost stockpiles, issue robust guidance, deploy resources quickly, and reinforce surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you combine the immune escape from this drastic drift with further changes that boost viral fitness as it spreads more (which help the virus replicate better in human airways), you get a season where flu spreads faster, infects more people, and pushes high-risk groups into hospitals sooner, pushing infrastructure and capacity concerns,” Rajnarayanan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signs are already here. In the U.K., Japan, and Canada, there have already been increases in flu cases, leading to an earlier-than-usual flu season. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) data showed that &lt;a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/ukhsa-issues-flu-warning-after-32692632"&gt;flu-associated hospitalizations increased&lt;/a&gt; from the end of September into October, affecting people over the age of 75.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Countries hit early may have been caught off guard and are scrambling to ramp up countermeasures,” Rajnarayanan said. “With early alerts now coming from our international partners, we have a narrow window to act — boost stockpiles, issue robust guidance, deploy resources quickly, and reinforce surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One concern is that this year’s flu vaccine was recommended before the new strain emerged. Fortunately, early studies show that the vaccine still offers some protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study in the medical journal &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext"&gt;Eurosurveillance&lt;/a&gt; stated “our early estimates provide reassurance that current NH enhanced vaccines provide protection in children, adolescents and adults in the early period post-vaccination. The high VE [vaccine effectiveness] in children and adolescents strengthens the case for optimising vaccine uptake in this group, where we could also see indirect protection of other age cohorts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In England, the National Health Service issued a “flu jab SOS,” urging those eligible for the free vaccine to get it quickly and protect themselves this winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am concerned about everything related to infectious disease under the Trump administration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But public trust in the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://source.washu.edu/2025/09/trust-in-cdc-on-flu-vaccines-falls-nearly-20-among-st-louisans/"&gt;is declining, and no such similar call to action has been made&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, surveillance of the virus has been lacking. During the record-breaking government shutdown, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/22/health/disease-surveillance-government-shutdown"&gt;stopped updating key dashboards&lt;/a&gt; tracking influenza, RSV and COVID-19 activity. While tracking resumed after the shutdown, some public health experts aren’t confident that a tough season will be well-managed by the public health agency under Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/robert_f_kennedy_jr"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am concerned about everything related to infectious disease under the Trump administration because the chief of HHS is an anti-vaccine advocate and doesn’t even believe in the germ theory of disease,” Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Salon. “He has destroyed the CDC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and author of the newsletter Your Local Epidemiologist, told Salon, that it’s important to note that states still collect data to send to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Within CDC, there is an important distinction between political operatives and CDC scientists,” Jetelina said. “The scientists are still in control of the data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But streams of data are thinner, Rajnarayanan noted, and more delayed because of the shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the mutations, Adalja said getting vaccinated is still the best way for people to protect themselves against the flu this season because the vaccine contains three strains. While it’s a “mismatch” for the H3N2 strain, it’s still protects the H1N1 or influenza B components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The dominant H3N2 strain has evolved away from the H3N2 included in the vaccine so the vaccine strain is not perfectly matched to it,” Adalja said. “The influenza vaccine remains the best way to protect oneself from the virus, especially against severe disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajnarayanan said while masks are “not popular in the USA right now,” they are still a good option for protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stay home when sick and seek early testing and antivirals if you’re high-risk and develop symptoms,” he said. “Layering these simple measures will significantly reduce transmission and protect the people most likely to become seriously ill.”&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The winter is often synonymous with cold and flu season. Unfortunately, those germs aren’t the only ones spreading widely around this time of year. So gird your stomachs and stay on the lookout for the dreaded norovirus, because it might soon be running rampant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nrevss/php/dashboard/index.html"&gt;latest surveillance data&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cases of norovirus are likely surging in the U.S. Just last week, about 14% of lab tests came back positive for norovirus, double the rate three months earlier, while several states are now experiencing relatively high case numbers. These early indicators suggest that the U.S. will experience a harsh norovirus winter for the second year in a row.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Stomach flu on the rise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though norovirus is often associated with &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/2025-has-been-a-nightmare-year-for-getting-violently-ill-on-cruise-ships-2000667251"&gt;cruise ships,&lt;/a&gt; it’s a ubiquitous and highly contagious foodborne germ. And it’s been &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/norovirus-cases-are-surging-right-now-2000544279"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt; as of late.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between August 2024 and July 2025, for instance, the CDC documented at least 2,675 outbreaks in the U.S., almost double the amount reported in the same period the previous year (1,478). More recently, the pace of outbreaks in the fall &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/php/reporting/norostat-data.html#:~:text=During%20August%201%20%E2%80%93%20November%2013%2C%202025%2C%20there%20were%20153%20norovirus%20outbreaks%20reported%20by%20NoroSTAT%2Dparticipating%20states.%20During%20the%20same%20period%20last%20seasonal%20year%2C%20there%20were%20235%20norovirus%20outbreaks%20reported%20by%20these%20states."&gt;seemed&lt;/a&gt; to settle back down. But norovirus is especially prevalent during the winter, as more people spend time indoors, and the early data isn’t looking good for a reprieve.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The 14% test positivity rate this mid-November is right around the same rate observed during the same time period last year. In December 2024, the country &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/norovirus-cases-rise-us/story?id=117138204"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a record-breaking surge of norovirus, with a peak testing rate of nearly 25%. According to Epic Research’s &lt;a href="https://www.epicresearch.org/data-tracker/communicable-diseases"&gt;data tracker&lt;/a&gt;, Wyoming, Nebraska, and Oklahoma are currently experiencing the highest number of reported norovirus cases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What to do about noro&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s no guarantee that norovirus this winter will reach or surpass the peak seen last year. But even a relatively mild season will lead to plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/infectious-disease/norovirus/"&gt;gastrointestinal misery&lt;/a&gt;. Annually, norovirus causes about 20 million cases of vomiting and diarrhea in the U.S. And though it’s rarely fatal, the illness still sends roughly 100,000 Americans to the hospital every year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given all that, it’s always prudent to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html"&gt;do what you can&lt;/a&gt; to reduce your risk of catching and spreading the stomach flu to others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You should always wash fruits and vegetables and cook your shellfish thoroughly, for instance. You should also clean your kitchen utensils, cutting boards, and surfaces, especially after preparing shellfish. And you should thoroughly wash your hands after handling uncooked food, since norovirus or other foodborne germs could be transmitted by your hands inadvertently touching your mouth later.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;And if you’re feeling queasy, you should avoid direct contact with people if possible and consistently wash your hands with soap and water (hand sanitizer will not work against norovirus).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All that might be easier said than done with Thanksgiving and the holidays coming right up. But as anyone who’s had norovirus can attest, it’s an experience that you should try to avoid as much as possible. Speaking personally, I’m crossing my fingers that scientists &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/from-covid-to-norovirus-modernas-mrna-tech-takes-on-stomach-flu-2000550591"&gt;finally figure out&lt;/a&gt; how to make an effective norovirus vaccine sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

test for cancer, treat it and save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, it is a far more complex issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Screening would rely on a blood test followed by scans of the prostate and a biopsy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But this can miss deadly cancers and detect those that never need treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Many prostate cancers grow so slowly you would have to live to 120-150 years old before they were a threat - so they do not need treating, the National Screening Committee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Their recommendations are based on the balance between lives saved by finding cancers early, and treatment that leaves patients unable to control their bladder or maintain an erection, whose cancer was not going to kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The UK National Screening Committee recommends:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;no screening programme for all men as it is "likely to cause more harm than good"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;no screening for black men due to "uncertainties" around the impact due to  a lack of clinical trials in black men&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;no screening based on family history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;but screening should be offered every two years for men between the ages of 45 and 61 if they have specific genetic mutations - called BRCA variants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;These were not touch-and-go opinions as there was a "strong consensus" on each of these recommendations, the committee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;BRCA variants increase the risk of certain cancers and, famously, led the actress Angelina Jolie to have her breasts removed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Around three in 1,000 men have BRCA variants, but many will be unaware unless they have family members that are known carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The National Screening Committee was asked to explain why they had not recommended that more men be tested for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Freddie Hamdy, who is also a urological surgeon in Oxford, told me: "The diagnosis of prostate cancer in a healthy man is a hugely disruptive event – with potential to affect quality of life, very significantly, for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It cannot be done lightly, men need to be really well counselled and informed before the 'snowball' starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Before you know it, you are on the operating table having your prostate removed – and we see examples of that all the time," Prof Hamdy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The screening committee's decision is not the final word. Today is the start of a three-month consultation before the committee meets again and gives its final advice to ministers in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland who will each have to make their own decision on prostate screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Wes Streeting, Health Secretary in England, responded saying he wants screening "provided this is backed by evidence" and that he would examine the evidence "thoroughly" ahead of the final advice in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Responses to the screening recommendations have been divided. Cancer Research UK said it was "good news" that screening was being considered for men with faulty BRCA genes and that they "support the committee's conclusion" that screening could cause more harm than good for other groups of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Sir Chris Hoy said he was "extremely disappointed and saddened", and described tests for men with BRCA variants as "a very small step forward" that was not enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I know, first hand, that by sharing my story following my own diagnosis two years ago, many, many lives have been saved.  Early screening and diagnosis saves lives," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Laura Kerby, the CEO of Prostate Cancer UK, said she was "deeply disappointed" and that the decision will "come as a blow" to tens of thousands of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prostate Cancer Research said the decision was "a serious error that ignores modern evidence" and was a missed opportunity for Black men and those with a family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Lives saved, but what's the cost?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A huge clinical trial - called Transform - has now started to try to fill gaps in the evidence on how screening could be safely rolled out to other groups, including those with a family history and black men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Hashim Ahmed, who is leading the trial, said the recommendations were based on a "solid piece of work" and that while some men will be disappointed, he felt the right decision had been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There is a small benefit… but the harms of diagnosing, testing and treating very much outweigh those benefits," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Cancer Research UK has used the latest evidence from the UK National Screening Committee to calculate the impact of screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;They say if you test 1,000 men aged 50 to 60:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="twenty-eight" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Twenty-eight&lt;/b&gt;: Would be diagnosed with prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="two" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Two&lt;/b&gt;: Lives would be saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="twenty" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Twenty&lt;/b&gt;: Would be "over-diagnosed" meaning a slow-growing tumour that doesn't need treating would be found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="twelve" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Twelve&lt;/b&gt;: Men are then likely to have treatment like surgery or radiotherapy that doesn't benefit them, but comes with harms potentially including being unable to control your bladder or maintain an erection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 16:07:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1NdmdUWWpydXhhTVhsTlhKT3VpTWNObjdjZng5ajVuTm5DWV9tUTNOLW10c0tack94Z2hfM3hMVmxfTU5iaXhvSGlacDJ5cWpfQUF0YV9YcHRfd9IBX0FVX3lxTE5fcmtzYUNLT3dMLXo1ZkpBb0RoMFk5ellxUmdYVHlaemlmRXQyc3lsd2k5TkpSNjZGVjhJYVJBVXc5VzZxcDNZa0VWR0N4T1FEeTh4Rmo1SW5oNmMzU3Z3</guid></item><item><title>外科医生警告不要同时服用的6种补充剂- HuffPost英国</title><link>https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/supplements-not-to-take-together_uk_69299f79e4b0308db07bbea6</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to lie, my morning routine has been permanently altered by learning that &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/iron-calcium-supplements-conflict-explained_uk_673b0819e4b067175c39234d" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="iron tablets" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69299f79e4b0308db07bbea6" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="673b0819e4b067175c39234d" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;iron tablets&lt;/a&gt;
