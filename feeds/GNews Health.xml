      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"Rural paramedic here. Several years ago had a woman call with feelings of impending doom. No pain, no symptoms, just 'I feel like I'm about to die.' Vital signs were all normal, on scene exams all normal. But she wanted to go get checked out, so into the ambulance and away we go."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"We went to the hospital, and she started getting really sweaty, but there were no other symptoms/exam changes/vital sign changes. We dropped her off, gave our report, and went back into service...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple hours later, we went back to the same hospital. I asked if they ever found anything with the previous patient, and I found out she passed away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CT showed a ruptured aortic aneurysm, and they didn't have enough time to transfer her or the resources to operate at that facility. The bizarre thing is, ruptured aortas usually (as in, every other case I've seen/heard about/read about) have other symptoms such as high heart rate, low blood pressure (or both), dizziness/lightheadedness, pain...this woman had none of those."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1gneoor/comment/lwd74oa/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank"&gt;u/Striking_Earth_786&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

After all, heart disease is the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/about/women-and-heart-disease.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:leading cause of death;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;leading cause of death&lt;/a&gt; for women of any age in the U.S. So, to maintain a strong ticker and general well-being, there’s one fitness tip experts recommend for women over 50—it’s incorporating &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/fitness-tips/a65540648/aerobic-exercise-tips-50-plus/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:aerobic exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;aerobic exercise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first, what is aerobic exercise? It’s continuous physical activity that increases your heart rate and breathing rate so your heart and blood vessels can work more efficiently. “Regular aerobic activity helps mitigate risks like cardiovascular disease, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a38595773/what-is-insulin-resistance-syndrome/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and bone density loss by improving heart health, managing body composition, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and reducing systemic inflammation,” &lt;a href="https://kovacsinstitute.com/drmarkkovacs.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mark Kovacs, Ph.D., C.S.C.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mark Kovacs, Ph.D., C.S.C.S.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a human performance scientist and longevity expert, previously said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://kovacsinstitute.com/drmarkkovacs.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mark Kovacs, Ph.D., C.S.C.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mark Kovacs, Ph.D., C.S.C.S.&lt;/a&gt;, a human performance scientist and longevity expert; and &lt;a href="https://drbrookebussard.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brooke Bussard, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brooke Bussard, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is a certified personal trainer and owner of Brooke’s Balanced Blueprint, a lifestyle medicine health coaching practice in Baltimore, MD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers speak for themselves. According to a 2023 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37036905/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Circulation, adults at 50 with ideal cardiovascular health are expected to live an additional 36.2 years, on average, while adults with poor cardiovascular health were only expected to live an additional 27.3 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for how much heart-pumping exercise to get, the CDC &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2712935" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;recommends&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. But “this is a minimum recommendation,” Kovacs said: People who worked out two to four times above the moderate physical activity recommendations (about 300 to 599 minutes each week) saw the most benefit in a 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.058162" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in Circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, something is better than doing nothing. “The best plan is the one you can stick with,” says &lt;a href="https://drbrookebussard.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brooke Bussard, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brooke Bussard, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a doctor, certified personal trainer, and owner of Brooke’s Balanced Blueprint, a lifestyle medicine health coaching practice in Baltimore, MD., who recommends walking for about 30 minutes five times a week. If three 10-minute dance breaks a day works better for you, that works too. The bottom line is movement adds up; workouts of less than 10 minutes still count toward recommended weekly activity goals, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When starting a new fitness routine, make sure to check with your doctor, especially if you have high blood pressure or any heart problems, and always be sure to listen to how your body feels when exercising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 15:42:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9zVTV4eWZOOTh2em5ucmdKaGNQYXc5VFJIMDBDdVdVbVJxakhKeHhvMmFLWkhpMWhSX2pGaF8tcEt0Q0NjbjlWZXJxV20yb2sxMnVUcVo1XzJyTDRGT1pzeF81RDVQREt4amx1Rl90dHV4d2J6X2RJYmVTUQ</guid></item><item><title>白发保护我们免受癌症的侵害？ - StudyFinds</title><link>https://studyfinds.org/gray-hair-protects-from-cancer/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;p class="post-featured-image-caption"&gt;Every single silver strand of hair represents the successful elimination of DNA-damaged cells. (Credit: Halfpoint on Shutterstock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gray hair in mice signals successful cancer defense&lt;/strong&gt;: When stem cells that produce hair pigment get DNA damage, the body forces them to mature and exit, leaving gray hair behind as evidence that potentially dangerous cells were eliminated.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carcinogens hijack the system&lt;/strong&gt;: Cancer-causing chemicals like UV radiation override this protective response by flooding stem cells with survival signals, allowing damaged cells to persist and potentially form melanoma instead of causing gray hair.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your hair follicle niche makes life-or-death decisions&lt;/strong&gt;: Surrounding support cells produce a protein called KIT ligand that determines whether damaged stem cells get eliminated (causing gray hair) or allowed to survive and multiply (risking cancer).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouse findings show support in human tissue&lt;/strong&gt;: While the protective mechanism was demonstrated in mice, researchers found elevated KIT ligand in several human melanoma samples, suggesting similar processes may occur in people, though more research is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those silver strands sprouting on your head might be doing more than announcing your age. Research from the University of Tokyo shows that gray hair in mice reflects a built-in cleanup program in which the body hunts down and eliminates damaged cells capable of becoming cancer. Importantly, there are supporting signs this same mechanism is present in human skin tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists tracked what happens to the stem cells responsible for hair color when they get damaged. This led to a surprising discovery in mice. Their bodies force these damaged cells to mature and then kick them out, leaving behind gray hair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a biological trade-off that may be happening in humans too. In other words, accept some &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/no-gray-hairs-preserve-hair-color/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gray hairs&lt;/a&gt;, or allow damaged cells to persist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gray-hair-101-how-follicles-clear-cells-tied-to-skin-cancer"&gt;Gray Hair 101: How Follicles Clear Cells Tied To Skin Cancer&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stem cells in your hair follicles act as tiny factories that produce pigment. When everything works correctly, these cells wake up during each hair growth cycle, make copies of themselves, and send some of their offspring down the hair shaft to add color. Then they go back to sleep until the next cycle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what happens when radiation, sun damage, or other environmental stressors break the DNA in these &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/male-infertility-stem-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stem cells?&lt;/a&gt; Researchers Yasuaki Mohri and Emi K. Nishimura discovered something unexpected. The damaged cells don’t just die quietly. Instead, they get forced into an unusual double state: they stop dividing forever (that’s the safety brake) while simultaneously maturing into regular pigment cells (that’s the exit strategy).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cells essentially get a one-way ticket out of the follicle. They complete one last job making pigment, then leave the protected stem cell area and get cleared away naturally. The hair follicle loses its color-making factory, and you get a gray hair. Each silver strand represents a successful elimination of cells carrying &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/dna-damage-not-main-culprit-in-sunburns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DNA damage.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-025-01769-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, confirmed this in mice by studying animals lacking p53, a protein that acts as the body’s chief DNA damage detector. These mice kept their dark fur even after radiation exposure that would normally cause graying. Sounds great, right? Not exactly. Those damaged cells stayed put, raising the risk that they could eventually transform into cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-carcinogens-hijack-the-system"&gt;When Carcinogens Hijack the System&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the researchers exposed mice to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/do-hot-drinks-really-give-you-cancer-gut-expert-explains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer-causing&lt;/a&gt; chemicals like DMBA (a lab carcinogen used in skin-cancer models) or strong UV radiation, those substances didn’t trigger gray hair at all. Even when the cells had the same DNA breaks that radiation causes, the carcinogens somehow convinced them to keep dividing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trick involves a protein called KIT ligand, or KITL. Normally, cells surrounding the stem cells produce small amounts of KITL to support the stem cell population. But carcinogens cranked up KITL production dramatically, essentially shouting “keep growing!” to cells that should be getting eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the carcinogens turned on arachidonic acid pathways inside the damaged stem cells. When researchers gave mice a prostaglandin E2-like signal (a product of this pathway), it reproduced the effect, blocking the graying response. It’s a two-pronged attack: external survival signals from the environment combined with internal changes that favor growth over elimination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mice treated with just a carcinogen didn’t go gray—their damaged stem cells survived and spread into the surrounding skin, forming the pigmented spots that can progress to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/melanoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt;. When researchers gave mice both radiation and a carcinogen together, the carcinogen won, blocking the protective gray hair response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-skin-stem-cell-niche"&gt;The Skin Stem Cell Niche&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test whether KITL really controls this life-or-death decision, the team created mice with reduced KITL in the cells surrounding stem cells. These mice went gray faster, even without any radiation exposure. Their stem cells couldn’t maintain themselves without enough KITL support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More tellingly, when these low-KITL mice received both radiation and carcinogens, the carcinogens couldn’t override the protective response anymore. The mice still went gray because their environment lacked enough KITL to keep damaged stem cells alive. The experiment proved that the surrounding niche makes the critical decision about whether damaged stem cells get eliminated or allowed to persist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined human melanoma samples, specifically the type caused by cumulative sun exposure over many years. In several samples, KITL was elevated not just around&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/hair-follicle-transplants-wounds-scars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; hair follicles&lt;/a&gt; but throughout the skin surrounding tumors. The cancer had essentially expanded its own support system, creating an environment where damaged cells could thrive and spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-mystery-of-recovering-gray-hair"&gt;The Mystery of Recovering Gray Hair&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rare case reports describe a puzzling phenomenon. Patients whose gray hair appears to “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/frankenstein-could-an-assembled-body-ever-breathe-bleed-or-think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;come back to life&lt;/a&gt;” and regain color in certain scalp areas, only to receive a melanoma diagnosis in those exact spots months later. This research offers a possible explanation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The gray hair wasn’t actually recovering. Instead, early melanoma cells spreading through the epidermis were producing their own KITL and other growth factors, supporting any remaining stem cells and their pigment-producing offspring. The darkening hair was actually a warning sign that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; precursor cells were colonizing that area of scalp.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This reframes what looks like rejuvenation as an early danger signal—a cancerous field spreading beneath the skin surface, creating conditions that support cell growth rather than elimination.&lt;/p&gt;

(Photo by Pixel-Shot on Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-skin-and-gray-hair-signals-that-shift-skin-cancer-defenses"&gt;Aging Skin and Gray Hair: Signals That Shift Skin Cancer Defenses&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the team compared young and old mice, they found that aging naturally reduces KITL and other growth factors produced by the stem cell niche. In older mice, these support signals fall and graying speeds up. Aged skin simply doesn’t support stem cell maintenance as well as &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/baby-carrots-beautiful-skin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;young skin&lt;/a&gt; does.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this decline might not be entirely bad. By reducing the signals that promote stem cell survival and growth in mice, aging skin may be tilting the balance toward elimination rather than preservation of cells that have accumulated DNA damage over time. It’s a biological guardrail that becomes more conservative with age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Single-cell analysis of over 60,000 skin cells from young and old mice revealed that the proportion of both stem cells and melanocyte clusters dropped significantly in aged animals. The stem cell niche itself shrinks with age in mice, not just the stem cells it supports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test whether cancer-driving mutations could bypass the protective response like carcinogens do, researchers created mice carrying activated versions of NRAS or BRAF — two of the most common genetic changes in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/skin-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;human melanoma&lt;/a&gt; — specifically in their hair color stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These mutant mice kept their dark fur even after doses of radiation that would normally eliminate all stem cells and cause complete graying. The mutations made cells independent of external KITL signals, allowing them to survive and multiply despite DNA damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team then flipped the question. Could eliminating stem cells through the protective response prevent melanoma? They irradiated cancer-prone mice before triggering the melanoma mutations. Melanoma development dropped dramatically compared to non-irradiated controls. By depleting the stem cell population first, there were simply fewer cells available to transform into cancer when the mutations hit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-real-people"&gt;What This Means for Real People&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings don’t suggest that radiation &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/stop-cancer-cells-invisible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;prevents cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Kt clearly doesn’t, and the doses used in research mice don’t match human exposures. But the research does reveal something important about visible aging: those gray hairs represent successful quality control, not just breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People who gray early or extensively, especially in sun-exposed areas like the temples and crown, may have particularly active protective mechanisms. Each gray hair is a follicle where the body identified damage and chose elimination over risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether anti-aging treatments aimed at preventing or reversing gray hair could affect melanoma risk remains an open question for future studies. If such treatments work by keeping damaged stem cells alive and functional longer, it’s unclear what that might mean for cancer development in people with significant sun exposure or other DNA damage sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team calls the protective process “seno-differentiation,” combining cellular aging’s permanent growth arrest with the maturation and migration that clears damaged cells from stem cell homes. It’s natural quality control that doesn’t require drugs or interventions, just the body’s built-in wisdom about when to eliminate rather than repair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paradox is clear. Fewer stem cells (and more gray hair) can protect against cancer by limiting the pool of cells available for transformation. Visible &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/growing-old-life-gets-better-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt; in this case reflects invisible protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-bigger-picture"&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, should we rethink the relationship between aging and cancer? They’re often portrayed as related processes driven by accumulated DNA damage, but this work shows the body’s response to damage matters more than the damage itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stem cells studied here face a fundamental choice when they acquire DNA breaks. Either undergo the protective elimination program that causes gray hair, or bypass it through carcinogen exposure or cancer mutations and risk melanoma. Individual cells make this decision based on signals from their surrounding environment, but the cumulative effects of millions of these decisions determine whether a person develops gray hair or cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The surrounding niche acts as the critical decision-maker, integrating information about growth factor levels, damage signals, and metabolic status to instruct each stem cell about its fate. When carcinogens reprogram the niche to produce high KITL levels, they’re essentially rigging the decision &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/mammograms-after-80-longer-breast-cancer-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;in favor of survival&lt;/a&gt; over elimination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding this antagonism between gray hair and melanoma at the single-cell level opens new ways of thinking about cancer prevention that don’t focus on eliminating all damaged cells but rather on ensuring the right cells get eliminated at the right time through natural pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team used genetically modified mice that express fluorescent markers in melanocyte stem cells, allowing them to track individual cells through microscopy over weeks and months. They synchronized hair growth cycles through depilation and exposed mice to three types of stress at specific times: X-ray radiation (4-5 Gy), topical carcinogen application (DMBA, 100 μg weekly), or UVB radiation (20-200 mJ/cm² three times weekly). Additional mice had specific genes deleted only in stem cells or in the surrounding support cells to test which molecular pathways were required for gray hair versus melanoma development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team isolated pure populations of stem cells and surrounding niche cells using flow cytometry and analyzed their gene activity through RNA sequencing. They also examined over 60,000 individual skin cells from young and old mice to understand aging effects. Human melanoma samples from 15 patients were analyzed for KITL expression patterns and compared to normal skin from 3 control subjects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stem cells exposed to radiation entered a state where they stopped dividing permanently while simultaneously maturing into pigment cells—a process the researchers termed “seno-differentiation.” These cells migrated out of their protective niche and were naturally cleared away, depleting the stem cell reserve and causing gray hair. This protective elimination depended on the p53 protein, and mice lacking p53 in stem cells kept their dark fur after radiation but retained damaged cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carcinogens like DMBA and UVB radiation prevented gray hair by dramatically increasing KITL production in surrounding niche cells while activating protective fat metabolism inside damaged stem cells. This combination allowed damaged stem cells to survive and spread into the skin rather than being eliminated. When mice were given both radiation and carcinogens together, the carcinogen blocked the protective response and prevented graying. Prostaglandin E2 treatment mimicked this effect, confirming that fat metabolism products help damaged cells evade elimination. Mice engineered to produce less KITL in their niche went gray faster and couldn’t be rescued by carcinogens, proving the niche makes the critical survival-versus-elimination decision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gene activity analysis revealed that radiation turned on p53 damage response pathways and immune signaling related to detecting broken DNA, while carcinogens activated drug metabolism and fat processing pathways instead. Aged mice showed reduced KITL and other growth factor production in their niches, contributing to faster stem cell loss and graying. Mice carrying common melanoma mutations (activated NRAS or BRAF) maintained their stem cells despite radiation, and depleting stem cells through radiation before inducing these mutations significantly reduced melanoma development. Human melanoma samples showed elevated KITL in 8 of 15 cases, particularly in skin surrounding tumors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study used mice rather than humans, and while melanocyte stem cell biology is similar between species, important differences exist in how melanocytes are distributed (mostly in hair follicles in mice versus throughout skin in humans) and how UV radiation affects them. The radiation doses and carcinogen exposures were higher than typical environmental or medical exposures to create clear effects within experimental timeframes, so the findings may not perfectly predict responses to chronic low-level exposures humans experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research examined relatively short timeframes of weeks to months, while human melanoma typically develops over decades. The human melanoma analysis included only 15 cases of one subtype (sun-damage-associated lentigo maligna), so whether other melanoma types show similar KITL patterns remains unclear. The study also didn’t address how genetic variations in DNA repair, KITL production, or other pathways might affect the relationship between hair graying and melanoma risk in human populations.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;In a typical year, several thousand samples from flu patients around the world arrive at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They're crucial for understanding the virus's evolution and help form the bedrock of the World Health Organization's effort to design the next annual flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But this year, the flow of that data has come "pretty much to a grinding halt," says Demetre Daskalakis, who led the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at CDC until he &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/29/nx-s1-5522036/cdc-rfk-hhs-monarez-jim-oneill-leadership" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;resigned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in August. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;From February through July, he says CDC received only 427 samples, 60% fewer than the same time period last year. Only 12 countries had sent CDC samples by then, down 65% compared with 2024. CDC did not respond to NPR's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"When those viruses are not coming in, we don't know what to put in the vaccine, and you're going to have less effective vaccines," says Daniel Jernigan, former director of the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic infectious diseases in Atlanta, who also resigned in August.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A possibly patchier picture&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Seven labs around the globe — CDC included — form a network of "WHO collaborating centers" that together make sense of all the virus samples sent in from National Influenza Centers in over 150 countries. But shipments to that whole network are also down so far this year, says Maria Van Kerkhove, interim director of the department of epidemic and pandemic threat management at WHO.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;WHO typically foots the bill for the shipment of many of these samples around the globe. But on January 20, President Trump pulled out of the organization, accusing it of being "owned and controlled by China." The move blew a roughly billion-dollar hole in the organization's budget, and the fund to pay for shipments shrank. WHO is working to find other funding for the shipments, says Van Kerkhove. "We are committed to ensure that our ability to monitor and assess [flu] is not dependent on one member state."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But if this trend continues, scientists could have a patchier picture of influenza's evolution, says Kanta Subbarao, a flu researcher at Laval University who used to run one of those collaborating centers in Melbourne, Australia. "A reduction in the ability of national influenza centers to share samples will be a huge blow to influenza surveillance."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less data could mean a less effective flu shot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In February and September each year, scientists from these WHO collaborating centers meet to decide what influenza strains next year's flu shot should target for the northern and southern hemisphere flu seasons.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Because we can't predict exactly which virus will dominate in the next season, the vaccine contains multiple strains to try to protect the population against what will come," says Subbarao.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Picking those strains is a bit of a gamble, but one made less risky by the work of more sophisticated labs, like CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What we do is work up those viruses. We sequence them. We do tests in ferrets," says Daskalakis. "We do all this stuff to be able to sort of say this virus has a higher pandemic potential, this is a virus that is going to totally circulate next season for flu."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Fewer samples will make those analyses harder, says Arnold Monto, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan. "It reduces the amount of data that the decision can be made on."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;WHO officials declined to share precisely how much less data is getting shared with collaborating centers. And there's still time before February's meeting for countries to send in more samples. But Daskalakis worries that the slowdown at CDC could be harder to reverse, as countries may be wary of sharing data with the U.S. after its withdrawal from WHO.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pandemic preparedness slipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If CDC becomes increasingly out of the loop, Daskalakis says it'll make the U.S. less prepared for a possible flu pandemic. In addition to getting thousands of influenza virus samples from around the world, CDC typically receives about a dozen "candidate vaccine viruses" from the WHO network that serve as the raw material for mass producing flu vaccines in eggs.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"By the time I left CDC at the end of August, we had received two, not a dozen," says Daskalakis, which could make it harder to scale up a response to a potential pandemic flu outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;CDC's view of other dangerous pathogens, from COVID-19 to polio, is becoming dimmer too, Daskalakis says. That makes it harder for the agency to find concerning variants of any virus that might spark the next big outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The system is designed to be able to find needles in the haystack if it gets fed enough, if it gets enough data," says Daskalakis. "If it doesn't get fed enough, it's going to take longer to find the needle in the haystack."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And as Daskalakis learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, that time can cost lives.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every day that we delayed, every day we had less coordination, was a day that tens, hundreds, thousands of people were going to die," he says. If a similar virus hits as the U.S. continues to isolate itself, he foresees a repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "We’re still learning a lot about synbiotics, including which types, doses, and timing are most effective and for whom," &lt;a href="https://www.henryford.com/blog/tags/ashlee-carnahan" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ashlee Carnahan, MS, RDN, CLC,&lt;/a&gt; manager of nutrition and education services and dietetic internship director at Henry Ford Health in Detroit, told Verywell in an email.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's a good idea to speak with a healthcare provider before trying a synbiotic, especially if you have a chronic condition or a weakened immune system, Carnahan added.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are synbiotic food pairings that don't involve pills or powders.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Some combinations would be yogurt, which is your probiotic, with bananas or berries, which give you prebiotics. Or kimchi, which is your probiotic, with stir-fried vegetables and rice for your prebiotic," &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/vanessa-king" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vanessa King, MS, RDN, CNSC&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics based in Los Angeles, California, told Verywell.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, you don't need to stress too much about making the perfect synbiotic food pairing. You will likely hit the targets you need if you eat a wide variety of flavorful foods, King added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-are-synbiotics-really-better-than-omega-3s"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Are Synbiotics Really Better Than Omega-3s? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to add synbiotics to your diet, don't cut out omega-3s. The new study linked synbiotics with a stronger anti-inflammatory effect, but &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/benefits-of-omega-3-11772277" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; still had an anti-inflammatory effect and offer other benefits for brain and heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Even though the study shows that it wasn't as effective for this particular activity in the body, omega-3s are critical to our health. They're an essential nutrient that we need to get from our food, because our body can't make it," King said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study focused on supplements, but evidence has shown that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-high-in-omega-3-11686761" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3s food sources&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/fatty-fish-11837132" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fatty fish&lt;/a&gt;, provide more health benefits than supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For maximum benefits, find ways to add probiotics, prebiotics, and omega-3s into your diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "One of my favorite breakfast combos is omega-3 eggs mixed with avocados, your prebiotic, and sauerkraut as your probiotic. And that is just divine, and really will deliver that anti-inflammatory power," King said.&lt;br&gt;

Unlike in big cities, resources for homelessness, addiction, and harm prevention in these communities are scarce. Over the past decade, rural parts of &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/77493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/77493"&gt;Kentucky, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://undark.org/2025/01/08/west-virginia-hiv-syringe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://undark.org/2025/01/08/west-virginia-hiv-syringe/"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; have reported surges in HIV infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In 2023, Penobscot County had the second-highest number of overdoses, both fatal and nonfatal, among all Maine counties, &lt;a href="https://mainedrugdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2023-12-ME_OD_Report-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://mainedrugdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2023-12-ME_OD_Report-Final.pdf"&gt;state data showed&lt;/a&gt;, which only hints at the extent of the region’s addiction troubles, said Gunderman. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A now-defunct homeless encampment facilitated the spread of the virus, but closing it in February made it harder to contact and treat the people at risk, health experts said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The outbreak is sustained and exacerbated by the privations of homelessness. For people with nothing, sex becomes an asset to trade for drugs or shelter, Gunderman said, and the virus is exchanged along with it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Also contributing to the outbreak: the closure earlier this year of the region’s primary HIV case management provider and source of sterile syringes. Among other services, the Health Equity Alliance, or HEAL, coordinated transportation to appointments, connected people with food and housing, and helped them enroll in programs that make medications more affordable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

Jessica Emery, who last week huddled in the doorway of a vacant Bangor storefront, said she visits a needle exchange every three days. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I had a life, I’m trying to get back to that,” said Emery, 43, who worked as a certified residential medication aide before becoming homeless about a year ago. “I don’t want to catch anything while I’m out here.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;On a recent Friday, Cronk walked the desolate railroad tracks toward his tent. The nearby river reflected the orange and auburn foliage of late autumn. He acknowledged a small piece of good news: his girlfriend, who is pregnant, recently tested negative for HIV. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The roughly beautiful surroundings belie a precarious existence, he said. He and his girlfriend found their tent slashed and their food stolen a few nights earlier. They slept that night in a corner of the tent that gave a little shelter against heavy rain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He’s not using drugs, he said, but over the past month hasn’t been able to afford the medications he needs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Every day I feel like I’m dying,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

            Doctor after doctor misdiagnosed or shrugged off Ruth Wilson’s rashes, swelling, fevers and severe pain for six years. She saved her life by begging for one more test in an emergency room about to send her home, again, without answers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv00063b6qvjxs9znr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That last-ditch test found the Massachusetts woman’s kidneys were failing. The culprit? Her &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/autoimmune-lupus-women-rheumatoid-arthritis-aff0e28dece3ef4168f301bd84331ea5" target="_blank"&gt;immune system had been attacking her own body&lt;/a&gt; all that time and nobody caught it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv00073b6qixgq0dc9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just wish there was a better way that patients could get that diagnosis without having to go through all of the pain and all of, like, the dismissiveness and the gaslighting,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv00083b6q8fch1q06@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wilson has lupus, nicknamed the disease of 1,000 faces for its variety of symptoms — and her journey offers a snapshot of the dark side of the immune system. Lupus is one of a rogues’ gallery of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/nobel-prize-medicine-a68cf8a3b930570630168a949d277cde" target="_blank"&gt;autoimmune diseases&lt;/a&gt; that affect as many as 50 million Americans and millions more worldwide – hard to treat, on the rise and one of medicine’s biggest mysteries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv00093b6q2fcngnva@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, building on discoveries from cancer research and the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists are decoding the biology behind these debilitating illnesses. They’re uncovering pathways that lead to different autoimmune diseases and connections between seemingly unrelated ones – in hopes of attacking the causes, not just the symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000a3b6qj4dnhvho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s a daunting task. That friendly fire ravages nerves in &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/multiple-sclerosis-epstein-barr-study-b325dceb5612e4ec7f22c8f25901e5eb" target="_blank"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, inflames joints in rheumatoid arthritis, dries out the eyes and mouth in Sjögren’s disease, destroys insulin production in &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/barbie-introduces-type-1-diabetes-doll-b60ab201a42604aeec03ba06346e1197" target="_blank"&gt;Type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, weakens muscles in myositis and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/tennis-monica-seles-health-myasthenia-gravis-b36b3d132edc3e7eecde19ca759e36ff" target="_blank"&gt;myasthenia gravis&lt;/a&gt; — and in &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/wnba-liberty-isabelle-harrison-brother-lupus-6f5a30c2610f57fe64923e8c80093144" target="_blank"&gt;lupus&lt;/a&gt;, it can cause body-wide havoc.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000b3b6qll4n17v5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The list goes on: A new count from the National Institutes of Health tallied 140 autoimmune conditions, many rare but altogether a leading cause of chronic disease that’s often invisible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000c3b6qbrqj4t7l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You look normal. People see you and they don’t think you have this horrible disease,” said Wilson, 43, who balances her illness with volunteering to help educate the public and even doctors about life with lupus.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000d3b6qxy6d7uuh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While there’s still an enormous amount to learn, recent steps have some specialists daring to wonder if just maybe, ways to cure or prevent at least some of these diseases are getting closer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000e3b6qhh87x2c2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In dozens of clinical trials, scientists are harnessing some of patients’ own immune cells to wipe out wayward ones that fuel lupus and a growing list of other diseases. It’s called CAR-T therapy and early results with these “living drugs” are promising. The first lupus patient was treated in Germany in March 2021 and remains in drug-free remission, the researchers said last month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000f3b6q5vu17ss0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And a drug named teplizumab can delay the start of Type 1 diabetes symptoms in people destined to get sick, buying some time before they’ll need insulin. Citing that “tantalizing evidence,” the NIH’s new five-year plan for autoimmune research — if it gets funded — urges pursuing similar windows to intervene in other simmering diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000g3b6q9ugqkylg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is probably the most exciting time that we’ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,” said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000h3b6q2ndmphgv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Your immune system has multiple overlapping ways to detect and attack bacteria, viruses or other bad actors. That includes teaching key soldiers – T cells and antibody-producing B cells — how to distinguish what’s foreign from what’s “you.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000i3b6qz2jrr96q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s a delicate balancing act, especially considering germs sometimes adapt features similar to human molecules so they can confuse and sneak past immune defenses. And while the immune system has built-in safeguards to curtail any misbehaving cells, autoimmune diseases set in when the system gets off-kilter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000j3b6qvvx6nhy1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Numerous genes involved in different immune functions can make people susceptible to common autoimmune diseases. That means if one family member is sick, others may be at increased risk. Such genes can include variants that &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/multiple-sclerosis-ancient-dna-c8fbfe4ba7d4e2447eec52c6000878dc" target="_blank"&gt;once protected our ancestors&lt;/a&gt; from long-ago threats including the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/oddities-science-health-plague-bubonic-04349f994460d01c56fe5a57960b6ce8" target="_blank"&gt;Black Death&lt;/a&gt; but that today can translate into a hyperactive immune system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000k3b6qs5pv4o57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But “genes are not everything,” said Dr. Mariana Kaplan of NIH’s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000l3b6qf3fkrs5b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Studies show if one identical twin develops an autoimmune disease, the other isn’t guaranteed to get sick. Non-genetic factors that trigger an immune response play a big role, such as infections, certain medicines, smoking, pollutants. In lupus, even a bad sunburn is suspect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000m3b6q1vhkb5ke@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At some point there is a second or third hit and the immune system says, ‘That’s it, I can’t handle any more of these insults,’” said Kaplan, who directs systemic autoimmunity research.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000n3b6qw2jcejyi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And women are more likely to get autoimmune diseases than men, maybe because of estrogen or their extra X chromosome. That’s especially evident in lupus; women account for 90% of cases, often young ones like Wilson.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000o3b6q19h9o01m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fainting spells and body-wide rashes began in her 20s and intensified with two pregnancies. Youngsters in tow, she saw a variety of doctors for fevers, swelling, joint and back pain until that fateful ER visit when she requested a urine test.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000p3b6qckj30y1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Months of grueling treatment saved her kidneys. But over a decade later, the Littleton, Massachusetts, woman still lives with daily pain from lupus. Deep fatigue and brain fog — difficulty with concentrating, short-term recall, multitasking — wax and wane.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Therapies have improved in recent years, from high-dose steroids and drugs that broadly suppress the immune system to include additional options that focus on specific molecules. Wilson gets a monthly lupus-targeted IV treatment and takes about six daily medicines to calm her overactive immune system and related symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000r3b6q01gp6srt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Worse are what are called flares, when symptoms abruptly and markedly worsen. For Wilson, they bring sudden high fevers, legs too swollen to walk, more intense pain, lasting days to a week. They impact her job at a medical lab and time with her husband, teen son and college-age daughter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000s3b6qrc1zksu1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not a bad life, it’s just a bad day,” she tells herself to get through.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000t3b6qci0f86b1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kaplan, the NIH scientist, has a biological explanation for the daily slog: The same inflammatory proteins that cause aches and fatigue during a cold or flu continually course through the bodies of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases like lupus.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000u3b6qenyu69yt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These are my babies,” said Dr. Justin Kwong, a research fellow in Kaplan’s lab at NIH, as he carefully examines cells in an incubator.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000v3b6qvymza1cs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kwong is performing something so tricky it’s not done in many laboratories: He’s growing batches of neutrophils, the body’s most common white blood cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000w3b6q4pocl0dk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They are first responders that race to the site of an injury or infection, and Kaplan suspects they’re among the earliest immune cells to run amok and trigger certain autoimmune diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000x3b6quy3po3wg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            How? Some types of neutrophils spew out their insides to form sticky spider-web like structures that trap and kill germs. The neutrophils die in the process.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000y3b6qhjecmdjg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But patients with lupus and some other diseases harbor abnormal neutrophils that form too many webs, Kaplan said. Her team is investigating if other immune defenses mistakenly sense the resulting debris as foreign, sparking a chain reaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000z3b6qloq1gust@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We think that’s a fundamental initial process,” Kaplan said. “We’re trying to find why it happens, why it happens more often in women, and can we come up with strategies to stop this without harming the way we defend ourselves from infections.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00103b6qavbaxovb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another common feature: Patients with a number of autoimmune diseases, especially women, often suffer heart attacks and strokes at unusually young ages. Kaplan’s research suggests those aptly named NETS, or neutrophil extracellular traps, may be key — by damaging blood vessels and spurring hardened arteries typically seen in older people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00113b6qiv9stoqd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But neutrophils don’t live long outside the body and testing mature ones from lupus patients’ blood won’t show how they went awry — something Kwong’s baby neutrophils may aid.
    &lt;/p&gt;







  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00123b6qams46bm8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whatever triggers it, lupus has bafflingly varied symptoms and treatments that can keep some patients symptom-free but not others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00133b6qeyietzkd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That suggests “lupus is not a single disease,” Kaplan said. “What we call lupus probably represents many different conditions that have some common factors.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00143b6q0j1luyef@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            How to subtype lupus isn’t clear. But another disease, rheumatoid arthritis, may offer clues. Perhaps best recognized by painfully disfigured fingers, RA can attack any joint and even some organs, sometimes scarring lungs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00153b6qy25ts1d9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like with lupus, RA treatment is trial-and-error and scientists are exploring different underlying factors to explain why. In one study, an international team used tiny samples of patients’ joint tissue to identify six inflammatory subtypes of RA based on patterns of cells, how they clustered and their activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00163b6qxth1jrox@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It “changed how we think about the disease,” said Northwestern University rheumatology chief Harris Perlman, one of the coauthors. Now researchers are comparing cells in joint tissue before and after patients start a new drug to see if they could help guide treatment choices, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00173b6qst7q6z7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wilson learned to wear sunscreen and a big hat outdoors and how to ration her energy in hopes of avoiding flares. When her kids were old enough for school, she returned, too, getting degrees that led to laboratory research and data science jobs — and a better understanding of her own disease and its treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00183b6qlbu9vhxr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One day her then-rheumatologist asked if she’d answer some medical students’ questions. Wilson remembers many knew “what lupus looks like in a textbook” but not the patient perspective.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00193b6qagpmpfk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I realized, my god, I need to start talking about this.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw001a3b6q72nhsw6o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What that looks like now: One evening last February, Wilson bubbled with nerves and excitement at finally meeting some members of her online lupus support group. At UMass Chan Medical School, Wilson greeted the two women and two men with hugs. They shared symptoms and treatments — and rueful stories of well-meaning relatives urging them to just get more sleep to combat the lupus fatigue that rest can’t conquer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw001b3b6qkb1h30ac@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A month later, Wilson traveled to Washington for a meeting organized by the Lupus Research Alliance, where she urged scientists and drug company researchers to heed patient reports of changes in their everyday lives, such as whether a new therapy helps brain fog.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw001c3b6q186ao40e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Drug studies that measure physical symptoms and blood markers are “only capturing half the story,” she said. “If a treatment allows me to think clearly, to engage in my life, to be the person I know I am beneath all of this, then that is just as important as reducing inflammation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw001d3b6qmtpit49k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While her doctor isn’t recommending experimental treatments yet, Wilson recently joined the Lupus Landmark Study that will track biological samples from 3,500 patients to better understand disease variations. Whenever a flare strikes Wilson pricks her finger for a blood sample to share.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw001e3b6q6v0um3dh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s important for me to also be a voice for patients because I think of myself and how lonely I was at the very beginning,” Wilson said. For a long time, “I never wanted to talk about it. Especially my kids, I wanted them to know that I was going to be OK. And so you put on your makeup and your lipstick and your three shades of eye corrector and you go on.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For decades, babies have been wincing, squirming and crying their way through a series of vaccinations that start as soon as they're born. The shots protect against diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and mumps, which once plagued children and their parents.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When I was a kid, my parents were terrified about my catching polio or measles or whatever. And friends of mine died," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p1554" target="_blank"&gt;Stanley Plotkin&lt;/a&gt;, a veteran vaccine scientist who is now 93 and a professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"A parent today very likely does not worry about his or her child dying of an infectious disease," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That's because routine childhood vaccinations have largely vanquished many diseases, making vaccines one of medicine's greatest triumphs.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long questioned the safety and effectiveness of many vaccines. And President Trump recently called for big changes in how children get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies it's a disgrace. I don't see it. I think it's very bad," Trump said recently at a White House event. "It looks like they're pumping into a horse."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So a powerful Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee hand-picked by Kennedy is now &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html" target="_blank"&gt;scrutinizing the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;. The schedule is the finely calibrated timetable pediatricians use to administer the sequence of more than 30 doses to protect against more than a dozen diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The move is being welcomed by some advocates, physicians and scientists.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it is true that any vaccine schedule should periodically be assessed," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/directory/ofer-levy" target="_blank"&gt;Ofer Levy,&lt;/a&gt; a vaccine scientist at Harvard. "As we like to say, 'Moses did not come down from Mount Sinai saying: 'This will be the only way that you immunize.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But others worry the review is part of Kennedy's campaign against vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has for 20 years been an anti-vaccine activist and science-denialist. You would have hoped that when he was confirmed as secretary of Health and Human Services he would have taken on his job, which is to protect the health of children in this country. But he didn't," says Dr.&lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a" target="_blank"&gt; Paul Offit&lt;/a&gt;, who runs the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. "All he cares about is making vaccines less available, less affordable and more feared."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Federal officials did not respond to NPR's questions about a possible overhaul of the childhood vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The scrutiny is especially troubling to many public health authorities, coming amid &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/12/nx-s1-5572507/us-measles-outbreaks-texas-south-carolina-utah-minnesota" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new outbreaks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of diseases like measles and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5576494/louisiana-whooping-cough-pertussis-infant-deaths" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;whooping cough&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These are on the rise because of falling immunization rates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Offit and others say every vaccine is meticulously evaluated before being added to the schedule. And researchers and regulators continually monitor all vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"All the data and evidence suggest that our vaccine schedule is incredibly safe and incredibly effective," Dr. &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/yvonne-maldonado" target="_blank"&gt;Yvonne Maldonado&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Stanford University. "In fact, it is probably the most effective vaccine schedule in the world."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kids get this roster of shots at a young age to make sure they don't catch dangerous diseases when they're most vulnerable, Maldonado and others say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some people who are worried about vaccines argue the number of different antigens and other ingredients could overwhelm a child's immune system. But babies' immune systems can handle it, says Maldonado and other scientists. Children are exposed to far more stimulation naturally from microbes than from vaccines. And vaccines have been refined over the decades to minimize the number of ingredients they contain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are about 170 different components in the various shots in today's vaccine schedule, Offit says, which is "actually less than the vaccines that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and I got as children of the early 1950s," Offit says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Experts are especially alarmed that the CDC is investigating splitting up the MMR vaccine, which protects kids against measles, mumps and rubella in one shot. Giving kids three separate shots would mean more trips to the doctor and more needles, vaccine proponents like Offit say. They worry that, inevitably, more kids would end up missing vaccines. And it would take years to develop new individual shots, according to the proponents.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014TNITAA4/jesse-l-goodman" target="_blank"&gt;Jesse Goodman&lt;/a&gt;, a vaccine expert at Georgetown University who used to regulate vaccines at the Food and Drug Administration, says: "It's as if you had this really winning football team and you said, 'Well, gee, we're winning. We win every season. We win every game. Let's change everything we're doing."&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;You won't find &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-warns-why-you-should-never-become-your-own-dentist="&gt;visits to the dentist&lt;/a&gt; at the top of most people's lists of fun activities, but check-ups could be made easier by a gel that repairs and replaces damaged tooth enamel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the work of an international team led by researchers at the University of Nottingham in the UK, and it has the potential to fill a gap in our extremely limited &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/axolotl-discovery-brings-us-closer-than-ever-to-regrowing-human-limbs"&gt;regenerative capabilities&lt;/a&gt;: We can't naturally regrow tooth enamel once it has decayed away, but replacing this protective covering on damaged teeth could help prevent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-could-be-a-link-between-tooth-decay-and-our-immune-system"&gt;tooth decay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like some previous attempts to regrow enamel, this new gel mimics how tooth enamel gets laid down in the first place&lt;/span&gt;. The new solution can fill in cracks in teeth, and be applied on top of bare, exposed &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"&gt;dentine&lt;/a&gt; (the bone-like bulk of a tooth, below the enamel).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/toothpick-grooves-in-neanderthal-teeth-arent-what-we-thought"&gt;'Toothpick Grooves' in Neanderthal Teeth Aren't What We Thought&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When our material is applied to demineralized or eroded enamel, or exposed dentine, the material promotes the growth of crystals in an integrated and organized manner, recovering the architecture of our natural healthy enamel," &lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/new-gel-restores-dental-enamel-and-could-revolutionise-tooth-repair"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; pharmaceutical scientist Abshar Hasan of the University of Nottingham in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When enamel grows for the first time, it does so via a scaffold made by natural proteins called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelogenin"&gt;amelogenin&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the researchers attempted to replicate that scaffolding using proteins called elastin-like recombinamers or ELRs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180267" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180267" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/GrowingEnamel.jpg" alt="Growing enamel image" class="wp-image-180267 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/GrowingEnamel.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/GrowingEnamel-600x350.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180267" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Electron microscope images showing the protective coating on teeth with demineralized enamel (left) can be restored after two weeks with the new treatment (right)&lt;/span&gt;. (Hasan et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Commun.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This synthetic scaffolding then works like the natural equivalent, encouraging the growth of new enamel through a process known as epitaxial mineralization. New enamel crystals form from calcium and phosphate in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-smart-dental-floss-can-detect-your-stress-from-saliva"&gt;saliva&lt;/a&gt;, or, in the case of these lab experiments, in a solution added to extracted teeth after the scaffold has been built up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the new crystals are seamlessly aligned with the crystals in whatever part of the natural dentine or enamel remains. Furthermore, the resulting enamel shows signs of being just as strong as the material it's replacing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have tested the mechanical properties of these regenerated tissues under conditions simulating real-life situations – such as tooth brushing, chewing, and exposure to acidic foods – and found that the regenerated enamel behaves just like healthy enamel," &lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/new-gel-restores-dental-enamel-and-could-revolutionise-tooth-repair"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Hasan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tooth decay is such a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/affluent-children-are-more-likely-to-have-a-common-dental-problem-here-s-why"&gt;big health problem&lt;/a&gt; that for years scientists have been testing and developing ways to replace worn enamel, including the use of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-develop-world-first-liquid-that-regenerates-damaged-tooth-enamel"&gt;liquids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/peptide-based-technology-could-heal-dental-cavities-amelogenins"&gt;peptides&lt;/a&gt;. One day we might even be able to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lab-grown-teeth-are-another-step-closer-to-reality-scientists-reveal"&gt;grow entire teeth&lt;/a&gt; in laboratory settings, ready for transplanting into mouths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This stands out as one of the most promising developments so far though. It's easy and quick to apply – ultimately, a dentist could do it – and it outperforms the other options currently available for this kind of process, according to the researchers, who have founded a start-up to further their research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this still needs to be carefully tested in actual human mouths rather than just the lab so the researchers can determine whether it's safe. That's something they want to address in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"These results suggest that our technology could potentially provide a one-pot solution for the regeneration of dental enamel independently of the level of tooth erosion," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-64982-y"&gt;the researchers conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-64982-y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The fruit of &lt;em&gt;Nitraria roborowskii Kom&lt;/em&gt;, long used in traditional medicine, showed strong potential to fight insulin resistance and restore healthy metabolism in diabetic mice. The plant extract not only helped stabilize blood sugar but also corrected several related issues, including abnormal fat metabolism and oxidative stress. These results were linked to the activation of a key cellular signaling system that regulates how the body processes glucose and energy. The discovery points to the possibility of safer, naturally derived treatments for one of the world's most widespread chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of people living with diabetes is expected to climb to 750 million by 2045. While modern drugs can control symptoms, many come with side effects and do not address the underlying causes of metabolic imbalance. This has led scientists to revisit nature's medicine cabinet in search of new therapeutic options. Among these is &lt;em&gt;Nitraria roborowskii Kom&lt;/em&gt;, a tough shrub that thrives in the harsh deserts of western China. Its bright red fruits, sometimes known as "desert cherries," have nourished and healed local communities for centuries. Only recently have researchers begun to uncover the biological mechanisms behind its traditional use, prompting systematic scientific investigations into its potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakthrough Study Confirms Potent Diabetes-Fighting Properties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collaborative study between Qinghai University and the Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, published in the &lt;em&gt;Chinese Journal of Modern Applied Pharmacy&lt;/em&gt;, provided strong experimental evidence of the fruit's effects. Using well-controlled trials, scientists tested a concentrated form of the extract (NRK-C) on diabetic mice over seven weeks. The results were striking: the compound not only lowered blood sugar and improved insulin responsiveness but also addressed broader metabolic dysfunctions through a previously underexplored biological route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Desert Berry Restores Metabolic Balance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detailed analysis revealed the extract's impressive range of benefits. Over the course of seven weeks, NRK-C reduced fasting blood glucose levels by 30-40% in diabetic mice, with stronger results at higher doses. It also improved insulin sensitivity by roughly 50% compared with untreated animals. In addition to these improvements, the extract balanced cholesterol and lowered oxidative stress markers by as much as 60%, a rare feat for any single therapeutic compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further investigation showed that NRK-C works by reactivating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway -- a critical metabolic circuit that often breaks down in diabetes. This reactivation appears to "reboot" the body's ability to regulate glucose and fat metabolism. Microscopic examination supported these findings, revealing healthier liver and pancreatic tissue structures in treated mice compared with untreated ones. Taken together, these findings suggest the compound helps the body reset its metabolic function rather than just masking symptoms. Its naturally broad effects contrast sharply with the narrowly targeted mechanisms of many pharmaceutical drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expert Insight: A Holistic Approach to Diabetes Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results are exciting because they suggest we might be able to treat diabetes more holistically," said Dr. Yue Huilan, a senior researcher on the project. "Instead of just lowering blood sugar like most medications, this plant extract appears to help the body regain its natural metabolic balance. The implications could extend beyond diabetes to other conditions involving insulin resistance." While the team emphasized that human trials are still needed, the findings represent an encouraging move toward more natural and comprehensive approaches to diabetes care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery opens up several promising research directions. Pharmaceutical developers may pursue standardized NRK-C extracts as supplements or adjunct therapies, while nutrition experts could explore adding the fruit to functional foods aimed at metabolic health. The results also lend modern scientific support to traditional medicinal knowledge, helping bridge ancient practice and contemporary medicine. Researchers are particularly eager to determine whether NRK-C could help prevent diabetes in high-risk individuals or reduce complications in those already affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the findings underscore the value of preserving and studying traditional medicinal plants, many of which may hold untapped potential for addressing modern health challenges. Nature, it seems, still has many healing secrets waiting to be rediscovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The United States (US) aims to compel countries that receive its aid to fight HIV, tuberculosis and malaria to share all information about “pathogens with epidemic potential” in exchange.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is according to a US government document, the “PEPFAR [US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief] Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) template”, seen by &lt;em&gt;Health Policy Watch&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Countries that sign these bilateral MOUs with the US will also be expected to sign a “specimen sharing agreement” committing them to sharing biological material and genetic sequence data of such pathogens with the US within five  days of detection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This specimen-sharing agreement is envisaged to continue for 25 years although the US aid package only runs from 2026 to 2030. However, the MOU indicates that the specimen-sharing agreement is still being drafted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two highly placed and credible sources have confirmed that the US is rolling out these MOUs with African countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These bilateral deals will potentially torpedo the Pathogen Access and Benefit Sharing (PABS) system currently being negotiated by World Health Organization (WHO) member states. The US pulled out of the WHO in January, the day Donald Trump became president.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The PABS system is the final outstanding piece of the WHO Pandemic Agreement, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://healthpolicy-watch.news/presidents-and-prime-ministers-celebrate-the-passing-of-the-pandemic-agreement/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;adopted in May &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;after three arduous years of negotiations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Developing countries feel strongly that they need to benefit from any vaccines, therapeutics or diagnostics that are developed from the pathogen information that they share. The Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG) charged with developing a PABS system that balances access to pathogen information with benefit-sharing, &lt;a href="https://healthpolicy-watch.news/countries-deem-pathogen-sharing-draft-agreement-inadequate-at-start-of-text-based-talks/"&gt;began text-based negotiations&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the US bilateral MOU does not make any reference to countries receiving benefits from sharing their pathogen information, although they will get US support to develop disease surveillance and laboratories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US commits to funding “an assessment” of individual countries’ “outbreak surveillance system”, including “disease surveillance and safety procedures for pathogen sample collection, transport, storage, testing and disposal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US also commits to assisting with salaries for field epidemiologists – but only for 2026. Thereafter, countries will be expected to assume responsibility for a growing percentage of these salaries over the grant period, which lasts until 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US will also fund the salaries of some laboratory technicians and 100% of laboratory commodities to identify pathogens in 2026, “subject to the availability of funds”. But funding for these lab technicians and commodities is “expected to decline gradually” after next year, according to the MOU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transporting pathogen specimens to labs will become countries’ responsibility after 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Narrow focus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A technical guide accompanying the MOU sets out its purpose as “to establish an understanding between the US  Department of State and partner countries that will advance US interests, save lives, and help countries build resilient and durable health systems”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The PEPFAR template is narrowly focused on nine outcomes related to HIV testing and antiretroviral treatment; reducing TB deaths and malaria deaths in children under the age of five (U5); improving maternal and U5 mortality and polio and measles vaccinations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The MOU is heavily skewed towards disease outbreaks, and US donor recipients will be expected to have the capacity to “detect infectious disease outbreaks with epidemic or pandemic potential within seven days of emergence” and notify the US government “within one day of an infectious disease outbreak being detected”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the MOUs are signed, countries can expect funds from April 2026. Several African countries are &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/impact-US-funding-cuts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;desperate for funds&lt;/a&gt; after their HIV treatment and care programmes were abruptly terminated or disrupted after the US declared a three-month halt to foreign aid in January. Few of these programmes have resumed fully despite US assurances that they are still supporting life-supporting programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘America first’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The three pillars underpinning the new strategy are to keep America safe, strong and prosperous. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The long-awaited strategy clarifies how the Trump administration aims to restructure PEPFAR and replace functions of the now-defunct US Agency for International Development (USAID).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the strategy as “a positive vision for a future where we stop outbreaks before they reach our shores, enter strong bilateral agreements that promote our national interests while saving millions of lives, and help promote and export American health innovation around the world”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start your day with an anti-inflammatory breakfast like our Egg, Tomato &amp;amp; Feta Pita to support healthy aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The dish offers nutrients like protein and fiber to preserve lean muscle mass and reduce inflammation as you age. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This balanced meal comes together quickly, making it perfect for busy mornings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Inflammation can be tricky—it often develops quietly, without the obvious warning signs of other health issues. And while it’s easy to chalk up aches and pains to getting older, those symptoms aren’t always inevitable. The good news? Aging doesn’t have to mean discomfort. With the right foods, you can support your body from the inside out and move through the years ahead feeling strong.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One simple way to start: Build an anti-inflammatory breakfast that fuels your day and supports long-term health. Among the many morning options that fit the bill, dietitians say &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-breakfast-recipes-for-egg-lovers-8717818" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eggs stand out&lt;/a&gt;. “Eggs are an ideal addition to any anti-inflammatory breakfast—packed with protein to stabilize blood sugar, choline to support brain health, and vitamins A and D to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8050179/worst-foods-for-immune-system/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;strengthen the immune system&lt;/a&gt;,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritioninstincts.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Lindsay Stenovec, M.S., RD, CEDRD-S&lt;/a&gt;. Read on to discover why &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/egg-tomato-feta-breakfast-pita-8714236" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;EatingWell’s Egg, Tomato &amp;amp; Feta Pita&lt;/a&gt; earns the title of Best Anti-Inflammatory Breakfast for Healthy Aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-this-egg-tomato--feta-pita-is-our-breakfast-pick-for-healthy-aging"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Why This Egg, Tomato &amp;amp; Feta Pita Is Our Breakfast Pick for Healthy Aging &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Quick, protein-packed, affordable and easy to eat on the go? Yes, yes, yes and yes! The reason egg dishes, like an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/egg-tomato-feta-breakfast-pita-8714236" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Egg, Tomato, &amp;amp; Feta Pita,&lt;/a&gt; are morning staples recommended by dietitians is that they address the major pain points consumers are looking for when it comes to making mealtime happen. And, it just so happens to be “beautifully designed as an anti-inflammatory powerhouse,” says &lt;a href="https://www.patriciabannan.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Bannan, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From the eggs that bring the powerful punch of protein, choline and other essential nutrients, to the fiber in the vegetables and whole-grain pita, the calcium in the cheese, and the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/avocado-oil-vs-olive-oil-for-heart-health-11785897" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy olive oil&lt;/a&gt;, this combination is a surefire win for those looking to age healthfully. Plus, Bannan shares, “When prepared simply, eggs provide sustained energy without the blood sugar spikes that can contribute to inflammation over time.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-health-benefits-of-the-egg-tomato--feta-pita"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Health Benefits of the Egg, Tomato &amp;amp; Feta Pita  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are all the reasons why dietitians recommend an Egg, Tomato &amp;amp; Feta Pita as a great breakfast choice to promote healthy aging while &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/80991/10-ways-to-reduce-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lowering inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; High in Protein  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With 17 grams of protein, this is a great way to start your morning with a powerful protein punch. Bannan says, “Eggs are an exceptional choice for healthy aging because they provide &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-quality protein&lt;/a&gt; that helps preserve muscle mass, something we naturally lose as we age.” Plus, the protein is complete, meaning it provides ample amounts of all nine essential amino acids needed to keep the body functioning at its prime.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research shows that egg protein is not only important to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sarcopenia-treatment-11746009" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;skeletal muscle health&lt;/a&gt;, but also helps protect against sarcopenia, or age-related muscle loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Full of Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/3-habits-aging-study-8787260" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;unsung hero of healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;. Not only can consuming adequate fiber help keep your digestive system running smoothly, preventing potential carcinogens from lingering in your colon too long, but it also helps manage weight and lower inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research agrees that eating a high-fiber diet helps lower inflammation by producing compounds from fiber breakdown, such as short-chain fatty acids, which can contribute to this reduction. This recipe packs 18% of the Daily Value for fiber with 5 filling grams, and Stenovec notes that this fiber addition helps support a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/283531/top-fiber-rich-foods-for-good-gut-bacteria/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy gut flora&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Rich in Choline  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Choline plays a crucial role in memory, mood and muscle.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s found in animal-based foods, like meat, poultry, seafood and eggs. Unfortunately, many Americans are falling short of the recommended choline intake. Thankfully, eggs contain one of the highest amounts of choline, with one large egg providing 147 milligrams.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to recent research, older adults who consume around 187 mg of choline per day have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-mistakes-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-11779797" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better cognitive health&lt;/a&gt; and performance than those who consume less than this amount.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Having this Egg, Tomato &amp;amp; Feta Pita for breakfast nets you over 294 mg of choline, making a solid dent in your choline needs for the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Packs Phytonutrients  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Phytonutrients often function as antioxidants, helping reduce inflammation and improve overall body health. Think of them as your body’s self-defense system that you want to include more of. Thankfully, the all-star ingredients used in this breakfast combo are packed with phytonutrients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From the lutein and zeaxanthin (two antioxidants that specifically support eye health) found in eggs, to the lycopene (a potent antioxidant that’s been linked to reduced inflammation and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15297/our-top-15-heart-healthy-foods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;) in the tomatoes, there’s a treasure trove of these good guys in here.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, Bannan notes that the spice blend used, za’atar, is an unsung hero here, sharing “This typically contains herbs like thyme and oregano that are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-flavonol-rich-foods-11783068" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;rich in polyphenols&lt;/a&gt; with anti-inflammatory properties, plus it adds a big flavor boost without sodium.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-ways-to-support-healthy-aging"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Other Ways to Support Healthy Aging &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Prioritizing healthy aging while lowering inflammation certainly involves a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7874786/best-healthy-breakfast-foods-to-eat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy breakfast&lt;/a&gt;—but that’s not all. Other nutrition and lifestyle factors also play a role and, when combined with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-importance-of-a-balanced-diet-for-brain-health-8641834" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;, can support healthy aging. Consider these other strategies from Stenovec and Bannan to set yourself up for success as you celebrate more years around the sun!  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize protein at every meal.&lt;/strong&gt; Protein helps maintain muscle mass, especially as we age. Consider your personal protein needs and aim to incorporate 15 to 30 grams per meal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat the rainbow regularly.&lt;/strong&gt; The more color, the more antioxidants you’re providing your body from those fruits and vegetables. These compounds help combat oxidative stress and inflammation. Whether you aim to eat two plant foods of different colors at each meal, or try to eat 20 different plant foods each week, both strategies will bode well for increasing variety and phytonutrients in your diet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay consistently hydrated.&lt;/strong&gt; “Our thirst sensation decreases with age, but adequate hydration supports every bodily function from cognition to joint health,” says Bannan. Bring a reusable water bottle with you and fill it up regularly throughout the day, and consume foods with a high water content, like the cucumbers and tomatoes used in this recipe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat mindfully. &lt;/strong&gt;Distraction-free meals are crucial to helping you eat more mindfully. Close your phone, computer or tablet, and take a few deep breaths. Try planting your feet on the floor and taking each bite mindfully. These simple habits help you tune in to your digestion, allowing your hunger and fullness cues to sync so you naturally become more intuitive with your eating, preventing mindless munching that can often contribute to further inflammation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly. &lt;/strong&gt;Physical activity, in whatever form you enjoy, is a key strategy for healthy aging. Aim to move your body with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/new-research-shows-how-resistance-training-may-help-reduce-cardiovascular-disease-risk-8547423" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cardio fitness&lt;/a&gt;—like walking, swimming or biking—daily, while incorporating two to three days of strength-training movements to support lean muscle mass. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To support healthy aging, it’s essential to start your day with an anti-inflammatory breakfast rich in protein, fiber and phytonutrients. A balanced meal like EatingWell’s Egg, Tomato &amp;amp; Feta Pita can help preserve lean muscle mass and keep inflammation in check as you age. Best of all, it comes together quickly, perfect for busy mornings when you still want something nourishing and satisfying. As Stenovec reminds us, “Healthy aging starts with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7889310/drinks-for-better-digestion/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy digestion&lt;/a&gt;—and it doesn’t have to be complicated.”&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;New research into a popular sleeping aid has some scientists worried about long-term usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of adults with insomnia, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, has found that people prescribed melatonin for more than a year are at greater risk of heart issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among more than 130,000 adults across multiple countries, those who were prescribed melatonin long-term had an 89 percent higher risk of heart failure over five years, and were twice as likely to die from any cause, compared with those not prescribed melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-dietary-supplement-was-shown-to-reduce-aggression-by-up-to-28"&gt;One Dietary Supplement Was Shown to Reduce Aggression by Up to 28%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are preliminary and don't change current health recommendations. They do not necessarily mean that melatonin – the &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/cultivating-health/melatonin-and-your-sleep-is-it-safe-what-are-the-side-effects-and-how-does-it-work/2025/02"&gt;fourth most popular&lt;/a&gt; natural product taken by adults in the US – is causing dangerous repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the results do suggest is that longer-term uses of melatonin need to be studied further to ensure they are safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melatonin is typically considered safe and well-tolerated for short-term use among those who are not pregnant or breastfeeding. That &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/melatonin-for-sleep-does-it-work"&gt;means around 1 to 2 months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/cultivating-health/melatonin-and-your-sleep-is-it-safe-what-are-the-side-effects-and-how-does-it-work/2025/02"&gt;limited&lt;/a&gt; research on the supplement's effects after that time, a situation that some researchers believe should be remedied, especially as the supplement grows in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4371606"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; was presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Melatonin supplements may not be as harmless as commonly assumed," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/long-term-use-of-melatonin-supplements-to-support-sleep-may-have-negative-health-effects?preview=4987&amp;amp;preview_mode=True"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; medical researcher Ekenedilichukwu Nnadi at SUNY Downstate/Kings County Primary Care in New York.

Taking this substitute at the end of the day can help some people fall asleep and stay asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US and many other nations, melatonin supplements are available over the counter, which means patients can take them without medical guidance or supervision on dosage or length of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/neurolint15010031"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that long-term melatonin use is safe, comprehensive research is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other countries, the recent analysis from Nnadi and colleagues analyzed the electronic health records of adults in the US and also in the UK, where melatonin is only available via prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A secondary analysis found that those who took melatonin for over a year were almost 3.5 times as likely to be hospitalized for heart failure when compared to those not taking melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the risk of dying from any cause jumped from 4.3 percent to 7.8 percent between groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is concerning, but the findings should be approached with caution. The study's methodology has a major limitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were not surveyed on their melatonin use. Their prescription records were used to gauge who was taking what. This means that the control group (those who did not take melatonin) may have included, for example, people in the US who took melatonin without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlos Egea, President of the Spanish Federation of Sleep Medicine Societies, who was not involved in the study, notes this limitation in an expert reaction to the research. However, he still takes the study's associations seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings challenge the perception of melatonin as a benign chronic therapy and only highlight the need for a prospective trial with a control group to clarify its safety profile," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-conference-abstract-on-association-between-long-term-melatonin-supplementation-and-incidence-of-heart-failure-in-patients-with-insomnia/"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; Egea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in the short term, melatonin can come with downsides that many users aren't aware of. For instance, a recent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/melatonin-overdoses-in-australia-raise-questions-over-its-safety-in-children"&gt;series of non-fatal overdoses&lt;/a&gt; among children in Australia has &lt;a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/melatonin-shown-to-reduce-some-mental-health-disor"&gt;raised questions&lt;/a&gt; over the safety profile of the supplement for certain age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melatonin products might be based on a natural hormone, but that doesn't mean there aren't risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent findings were &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4371606"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; in November at the &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/ahasessions"&gt;American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The research provides evidence that a key feature of intelligence may stem from the way the brain encodes relationships between experiences, especially through a region called the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings point to a link between general cognitive ability and how well people integrate separate pieces of information into a structured whole. Rather than focusing on how smart individuals perform in specific tasks, the researchers examined how their brains encode the structure of experiences. The results suggest that intelligence may involve the ability to form a mental map of the world that helps guide flexible thinking and decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by researchers Rebekka Tenderra and Stephanie Theves at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics and the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Germany. They were interested in exploring how intelligence, especially fluid intelligence, might be related to specific patterns of brain activity during learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluid intelligence refers to the capacity to solve new problems and recognize patterns, often measured by reasoning tests. It has long been considered one of the core components of general intelligence and is strongly associated with performance across a wide range of tasks. Although past studies have identified brain areas linked to intelligence, such as the frontal and parietal cortices, the specific neural processes that underlie it are less well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesized that one way people differ in intelligence may be through how well they organize information into relational structures. In other words, smarter individuals might be more likely to represent different pieces of information as part of a broader map, capturing how elements relate to each other in space or conceptually. Previous studies had suggested that the hippocampus, a part of the brain known for memory and spatial navigation, plays a role in creating these kinds of cognitive maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, the researchers used brain imaging to observe how participants learned the locations of various objects placed within a virtual arena. Participants saw six different objects, each assigned to a specific spot in a circular space. They practiced placing the objects in the correct locations and received feedback after each attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the learning progressed, participants became more accurate at remembering where each object belonged. After completing the task, they were asked to arrange the objects from a bird’s-eye view, demonstrating how well they had internalized the layout. Their answers closely matched the actual object positions, suggesting that most participants were able to form a fairly accurate mental map of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record activity in the hippocampus while participants viewed the objects. They looked for patterns indicating whether the brain represented the spatial relationships between the objects. Specifically, they examined whether neural activity patterns were more similar for objects that were closer together in the learned layout, and more different for objects that were farther apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key finding was that individuals with higher fluid intelligence scores showed stronger signs of this “map-like” encoding in the right hippocampus. That is, their brain activity reflected a clearer sense of the distances between object locations. This connection between relational encoding and intelligence remained even after accounting for how well the participants performed on the memory tasks, suggesting that the brain patterns were not simply a reflection of who remembered more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional analyses showed that this brain-behavior link was consistent across various cognitive tasks, especially those that were more strongly related to fluid intelligence. The correlation was not driven by any single test but rather reflected a broad tendency among smarter individuals to organize their learning experiences in a more structured, map-like way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers compared people with higher versus lower fluid intelligence scores, they found differences in how consistently the brain represented object relationships. Those in the lower intelligence group had neural representations that were less consistent with a two-dimensional map. In practical terms, this suggests they may have encoded some object pairs in ways that didn’t align well with an overall spatial layout, pointing to lapses in integrating relationships across the whole scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further investigate this idea, the researchers asked participants to estimate distances between object pairs on a sliding scale. Again, the results showed that people with higher intelligence scores provided more geometrically consistent estimates, reinforcing the idea that they were better at integrating object relations into a cohesive map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tested whether the observed relationship between intelligence and brain activity was specific to relational encoding. They did this by including a separate memory task where participants simply had to recognize whether they had seen an object before. This task measured basic item memory, not how the objects related to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While participants performed well overall, the strength of brain responses in the hippocampus during this task did not correlate with intelligence scores. This suggests that general reasoning ability is specifically tied to the ability to encode relationships, not just memory in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results add to a growing body of work that views the hippocampus not only as a center for memory and spatial navigation but also as a hub for organizing information in ways that support flexible thinking. The ability to represent how different elements of an experience are related may provide a foundation for solving problems in new contexts or drawing inferences from limited data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledge that their study focused on a specific type of relational learning involving spatial arrangements. It remains to be seen whether the same principles apply to other kinds of abstract relationships, such as those involving concepts or rules. In addition, the study was conducted with a relatively homogenous group of healthy adults, which may limit how broadly the findings apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the research was cross-sectional, it cannot speak to causality. It’s unclear whether having a more structured way of encoding relationships contributes to higher intelligence or whether people with higher intelligence naturally develop better strategies for organizing information. Long-term studies could help clarify how these abilities develop over time and interact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that future studies could explore whether these relational encoding patterns show up in other brain regions involved in reasoning or generalization, such as the prefrontal cortex. There is some evidence that these areas also represent structured information, although it is not yet clear how their role compares to that of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.116033" target="_blank"&gt;Human intelligence relates to neural measures of cognitive map formation&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Rebekka M.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the British Medical Journal, the doctors from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/berlin/index.html" id="mol-3cec8b90-b99b-11f0-9f7c-27305d5dbb9f"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt; said the patients, a man and a woman, had consumed about 15 to 20 sticks of chewing gum a day. When they kicked the habit, both regained normal bowel function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sorbitol, also known as E420, is poorly absorbed by the small intestine and is known to have laxative properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, at the time, Dr Juergen Bauditz and his colleagues at the University of Berlin said many consumers might fail to link sorbitol or their chewing-gum habit with their stomach issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Briana Gelfand, a clinical nutritionist at Mount Sinai Diabetes Center in New York, told the Daily Mail she is not an advocate of chewing gum for this reason. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The act of chewing causes your body to anticipate food, prompting the release of digestive enzymes and stomach acid,' she said. 'With no actual food or nutrients to digest, the excess acid can irritate the stomach lining and worsen issues like acid reflux.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gelfand warned that severe or untreated acid reflux, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can cause lasting damage beyond the occasional bout of heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When stomach acid repeatedly flows back into the esophagus, it can lead to inflammation and ulcers - a condition known as esophagitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, this damage may trigger scarring and narrowing of the esophagus - called an esophageal stricture - which can make swallowing painful or difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another serious potential outcome is called Barrett's esophagus. This is a condition in which chronic stomach acid exposure causes precancerous tissue changes in the esophageal lining, increasing the risk of developing esophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts also note that the effects of GERD can extend beyond the digestive system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Persistent acid exposure can cause chronic cough, asthma-like symptoms such as trouble breathing, and lung irritation when stomach acid enters the respiratory tract. Additionally, tooth enamel erosion is common due to frequent acid contact in the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On top of this, Gelfand said that chewing gum can &lt;span&gt;cause you to swallow extra air, a process called aerophagia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you chew gum, you naturally swallow more frequently, and each swallow can introduce small amounts of air into your stomach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This buildup of air can lead to b&lt;/span&gt;loating or abdominal pressure, belching and increased stomach distension, which can push acid upward and worsen GERD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it comes to coloring, there are a number of hazards hiding in those hues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Consumer watchdog, the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2023/07/sticky-situation-harmful-food-chemicals-chewing-gum"&gt;Environmental Working Group&lt;/a&gt;, revealed how a 2021 study by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment found that dyes used in gum can make children vulnerable to behavioral difficulties, including decreased attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the EU banned titanium dioxide &lt;span&gt;after European food safety scientists determined the whitener can no longer be considered safe for human consumption.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A 2021 study by the European Food Safety Authority concluded nanoparticles of the substance can build up in the body and may cause cancer, developmental disorders, infertility or birth defects if reproductive cells are affected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite these concerns, titanium dioxide remains legal for use in food in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Oliver Wood, 12, (pictured) from the UK was hospitalized earlier this year with chest pains, shakiness and jitters after consuming more than 50 pieces of caffeine gum in 24 hours&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, some studies suggest that long-term or high exposure to substances like BHT may cause cell damage or hormonal effects in animals, though evidence in humans remains limited. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine, found in some gums, can also cause more obvious health harms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This year, 12-year-old Oliver Wood from the UK was rushed to the hospital with chest pains, shakiness and jitters after consuming more than 50 pieces of caffeine gum in 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This added up to 2,000mg of caffeine, the equivalent of 20 coffees or 25 cans of red bull. It is also five times the FDA's recommended safety limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous studies have linked gum chewing to headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2014 study by &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24188910/"&gt;Tel Aviv University&lt;/a&gt; made the connection studying a group of 30 young people - aged six to 19 - with chronic headaches who chewed gum 'excessively.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the participants stopped chewing gum for a month, 26 of them reported significant improvement, 19 of which said their headaches resolved completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the same 26 participants resumed chewing gum for two weeks, their symptoms returned, suggesting a strong correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers believe it is because chewing gum causes excess strain on the temporomandibular joint. The muscle tension and nerve irritation from this can cause headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New York-based personal trainer Natalie Alex told the Daily Mail that she believes chewing gum can also cause the body to produce more stress hormones, and there is evidence to suggest she is right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at Coventry University in the UK gave 40 participants a stress test either with or without chewing gum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the test, cortisol was 49 percent higher in a gum-chewing group compared to those who were not chewing gum. And after the recovery period, cortisol was 59 percent higher in the gum group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Today, the global chewing gum market is valued in the billions of dollars, with a projected value of $27billion by 2031 (Stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cortisol is a stress hormone produced by the adrenal glands. It helps regulate metabolism, blood sugar, blood pressure and the body’s stress response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When cortisol levels stay too high for too long, it can cause weight gain, high blood pressure, muscle weakness, mood changes and sleep problems. Chronically high cortisol is known as Cushing’s syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the digestive system, excess cortisol can slow digestion, increase stomach acid and irritate the gut lining, leading to issues such as acid reflux, ulcers, bloating or irritable bowel symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If cortisol levels remain extremely high and untreated, it can become dangerous - increasing the risk of heart disease, severe infections and, in rare cases, life-threatening complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Separate from cortisol production, Alex said the act of chewing in itself can stress you out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Constantly chewing can overstimulate nerves that keep your body in a slightly stressed state, which isn't great for digestion either,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In general gum once in a while is fine, but doing it frequently or on an empty stomach can definitely throw off your digestive balance.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Patients with strong negative symptoms responded best to the xanomeline–trospium combination, showing notable improvements in social behavior and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with bipolar-like features or aggression saw little benefit, pointing to multiple biological subtypes of psychosis that respond differently to treatment. These insights support the move toward precision psychiatry—matching medications to patient profiles to reduce years of trial-and-error prescribing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negative Symptoms Improve Most:&lt;/strong&gt; Social withdrawal and low motivation respond more reliably than hallucinations or mania.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Subgroups Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Distinct response patterns suggest schizophrenia is not one disease but many.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision Psychiatry Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; Tracking symptom-specific responses could guide personalized treatment strategies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Tufts University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Each year, about 100,000 Americans experience psychosis, a serious condition that disrupts thoughts and perceptions so profoundly that it can distort a person’s sense of reality. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now—just over a year after the first new schizophrenia drug in half a century was approved—a study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/em&gt; looks at how patients respond to it, offering early clues for more personalized treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Michael Halassa, professor of neuroscience at Tufts University School of Medicine, analyzed electronic medical records from 49 patients hospitalized for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder with psychotic features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All patients were given the new drug, Cobenfy—a combination of xanomeline and trospium chloride—on top of their usual antipsychotic medications after standard treatments failed to adequately control their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The new drug targets different receptors in the nervous system than traditional antipsychotic drugs, which mainly block dopamine D2 receptors in the brain,” says Halassa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clinical trials showed the drug worked well compared with a placebo. But clinicians are still assessing how it performs as part of real-world care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through statistical analyses of two small patient cohorts, Halassa’s exploratory study identified patterns that may help predict who may benefit from the xanomeline-trospium combination therapy and who might not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study analyzed clinical data for 24 patients, identifying several predictive clinical features for individuals who responded, did not respond, or had mixed responses to the addition of the new drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A statistical analysis of clinical data from a second group of 25 patients independently replicated these findings, supporting the notion of biologically distinct psychosis subgroups,” says Halassa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with prominent “negative symptoms”—such as social withdrawal, low motivation, or reduced speech—showed the strongest improvements after receiving the new combination drug with their usual antipsychotic medications, including brighter mood and greater social engagement. Those with a history of stimulant use also tended to respond especially well to the new drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, patients who exhibited aggression or bipolar features (mainly manic symptoms) saw little benefit from adding the new drug to their treatment. Patients with intellectual disabilities also showed limited improvement, though Halassa notes this finding is tentative given the small number of patients with that diagnosis in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug’s effects on other symptoms varied. Some patients with hallucinations improved, but not as consistently or dramatically as those with negative symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halassa says the results suggest schizophrenia may be less a single disease than a collection of conditions—much like a fever or pain—that can stem from different causes and require different treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He hopes the findings mark an early step toward the development of precision psychiatry&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;in which treatment-response patterns help guide care as they already do in other areas of medicine, such as cancer and immunology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To shorten the long and uncertain path to recovery for patients with psychosis, he says researchers need to test whether these emerging patient subgroups can truly predict who responds to which treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means running clinical trials that compare medications in people with specific cognitive or biological profiles and tracking the precise trajectories of these symptoms over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians will also need to track not just whether symptoms improve, but which ones—and under what kind of drug—to drive more personalized treatments. “If we start treating every symptom response and non-response as valuable data, we could save individuals and families years of trial and error in finding effective treatment,” Halassa says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1762463957714"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What does this new study reveal about the schizophrenia drug Cobenfy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: It identifies early patterns showing which patients respond best when Cobenfy is added to standard antipsychotic treatment, highlighting key symptom profiles linked to improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1762463959967"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Who seems to benefit the most?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Patients with prominent negative symptoms—such as social withdrawal, low motivation, and reduced speech—showed the strongest improvements in mood, engagement, and overall functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1762463959836"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Who responds less well to the medication?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Patients with aggression, manic features, or intellectual disabilities showed minimal benefit, suggesting biologically distinct psychosis subgroups that may require tailored treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and schizophrenia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7116141f1407181407145f03101b1406021a183105041705025f141504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Genevieve Rajewski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tufts.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tufts University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Genevieve Rajewski – Tufts University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44220-025-00529-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Preliminary real-world predictors of response to muscarinic targeting in psychosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Michael Halassa et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preliminary real-world predictors of response to muscarinic targeting in psychosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xanomeline/trospium (Cobenfy) was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite promising findings in placebo-controlled trials, there is limited understanding of its real-world use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we perform a post-hoc analysis of medical records following Cobenfy add-on administration in an inpatient population. In an initial cohort of 24 patients, ~40% experienced positive responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify predictive clinical features, we used a combination of hierarchical clustering and linear discriminant analysis, which showed that negative symptoms and stimulant use were the largest predictors of a positive response, while the presence of intellectual delay was negatively predictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern was independently replicated in 25 patients. Overall, this work supports the notion of biologically distinct psychosis subgroups and invites further research into the underlying biological substrates.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 21:36:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxPUGc5UTlZcWJxa01Nak5tZk5STlQ3djgyXzZuNEU5c2hBeXg1V3JNWmg1U2EyMXFQTVdKZHp3T0pJdVI1SmUxcXNXUElnUjZFbnRpWm1LdHp2eFByenVTUG1GeDlMUUhHb200clBLUXJtSEFwbDBPTlNUVm43NzVEeUFLZlk</guid></item><item><title>顶级心脏病专家揭示了容易错过的4个心脏病发作的微妙警告（以及为什么它们如此危险） -印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/top-cardiologist-reveals-4-subtle-warnings-of-heart-attack-that-are-easy-to-miss-and-why-they-are-so-dangerous/articleshow/125133280.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we talk about heart attacks, we usually picture a scene straight out of a movie scene – a man clutching his chest in pain, and then collapsing to the ground, unconscious. However, heart attacks, no matter how major, do not always look like this. In a video, Dr. Jeremy London, Cardiovascular Surgeon, points out that subtle signals can be just as critical, however, they are frequently missed. Spotting these cues can be life‑saving, because ignoring them can be hazardous. Let’s learn more….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jeremy often emphasises that breathlessness is a warning sign of a heart attack. It may also appear when there is no chest pain, leaving you with the feeling that you simply can’t draw enough air, whether you’re engaged in light activity, or just resting. The root cause is typically a heart that’s struggling to pump blood, which results in fluid accumulating in the lungs. Because the symptom can be subtle, many people mistake it for asthma or anxiety. Yet, if you suddenly become breathless in a way that's not normal for you, alongside other signs, you should seek medical help immediately. Dr London reiterates that in most cases, there will be no chest pain, which makes it imperative to pay attention to other signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Silent Heart Attack Symptoms Women Often Miss | Spot the Warning Before It’s Too Late | Dr Rajeev Agrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Weakness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jeremy emphasises that a sudden spell of dizziness, a light‑headed sensation, or odd weakness may actually be the body’s way of saying that your heart isn’t receiving oxygen. This oxygen shortfall usually arises when blood flow is obstructed, or slowed by problems. The danger lies in how these cues are brushed aside as simple fatigue, or dehydration. Yet realising that an unexplained bout of weakness or faintness, might signal a heart attack can spur action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Pressure, in the jaw, neck or back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr London, a heart attack without chest pain, can in fact, cause pain in other areas-the jaw, neck or the upper back. Dr. Jeremy points out that a feeling of pressure, tightness, squeezing or heaviness in those areas can be a tell‑tale sign of trouble. This discomfort often pops up intermittently, and feels unlike a muscle ache. Because such cues are atypical, many people fail to link them to the heart, which can postpone treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Jeremy, some individuals feel no pain at all, before a heart attack. They may however, notice vague cues-nausea, crushing fatigue or a general sense of malaise. Those subtle hints show up among women and older adults more often. Persistent tiredness, weakness or a lingering feeling of illness, without a cause, should never be shrugged off. Because these quiet warning signs are so easy to dismiss or are attributed to something else, they can let a heart attack slip further unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why these odd symptoms can actually be dangerous&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jeremy explains that these atypical subtle signs can be more hazardous than the chest‑pain symptoms. Because they’re easy to miss, people often delay seeking care, which raises the risk of heart injury, or even death. Recognising these cues improves detection, and boost survival rates. Prompt treatment can prevent complications, and lead to better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Listen to what your body is saying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jeremy’s core advice is simple-listen to your body’s warnings. If you suddenly notice shortness of breath, odd weakness, or a pressure sensation, in your jaw, neck or nausea, especially when you have risk factors such as blood pressure, diabetes or a smoking habit, don’t sit around waiting. Call emergency services, and see a doctor away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Women and older adults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jeremy notes that women and older adults, often don’t exhibit typical heart attack symptoms. This group tends to report fatigue, nausea or vague discomfort in areas beyond the chest. Recognising these signs is essential for treatment, and improving survival rates in these populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;It is important to stay updated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Jeremy also advises everyone to keep themselves tested regularly, even if they are not heart patients, diabetic, Hypertensive, and without any history of heart disease. Even perfectly healthy individuals can get heart attacks, so it is important to not miss your screenings, and keep your vitals, and blood sugar in control, always.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAJBVV95cUxOYzRSME9TbmhLU0U0WjZocUJ1VTJfcmdmUGREM2tTMmdCc3hjUDcxNjgyVGcwNllYbnlWbndZbkJuZlExRlltUHJ2Ty1rUHdRSmp0WEVZNVNMc2JQdzR1OXpyLWV0eEtQb2UxeDY4ZHRkdk1WQkhtUmtCWWdzY2YzVUR4QkJ0c25hRHFhalFFbG5veFBRdE5ZX1lreGhmWTUyR25PNVVkd1JaekVuQlozbDI2dUpISmNNZFlSVy1ZWWZxcmJKNGFnX3JMX0pqYk1LMHFMWm1mbVNMZmo5dXhfbXdUZS0tbENlbVNSbmFYYjVvTjVQbVdpeXFsa3piOWpKSVRUVEJfeGlOQXlIMWRyZ1hnbTB4RURUSXQ0YXJCak02N3QzX1g2aS13LTdUTHFHTzk1MNIBugJBVV95cUxNNlV0d2NReS14YWdnODloOHFpc2pISFVrWTJmaTFrNFRaRUZWaHlHNUx1aExNUHctaE5PcHZpYzl0OHlxa241QjlGRnY1c0phVkVHVWFmUGxCWFlYRjdXajhKNWdxUVNLQ0oyVUpMZHMzMUtuc3haVnFWcHpDOFE0Q0xZaGZYMC1lZjlCMk40bUduWGtuN0Y2NlZpSnhVdlZMTGtNN2dVVTdJajJXeUlwOFFhTHFCOFZabXVyZU5Zc0xxX0xKNWNDR3JISWZJTFBVbG1mcGdLcHpHWnhzekRLdEh4RjNhMWZYMk12TkVIam9LQ3B5YjRUR3JLcnBfRmNIYW1aUXpDaXpPeHNpOXdqN2poMkFMdFg3SEYySV8tenNDSzJ6VzBLNzc1RjNEN21ZTlRXRVhDaWxUZw</guid></item></channel></rss>
