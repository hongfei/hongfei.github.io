                &lt;p&gt;The same vaccine that keeps you safe from shingles could also do wonders for your brain, research out this week suggests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Stanford University and others examined what happened after shingles vaccination was introduced to the country of Wales over a decade ago. They found evidence the shingles vaccine not only reduced people’s risk of developing dementia but also lowered their odds of dying from dementia if they did have it. Boosting your immunity to shingles might offer a broad protective effect against cognitive decline, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This study suggests that [shingles] vaccination slows or prevents disease progression across the entire disease course of dementia,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01256-5"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in Cell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A natural experiment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several studies in recent years have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/shingles-shots-dont-just-prevent-pain-they-might-save-your-life-2000674980"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that shingles vaccination has benefits beyond preventing the painful viral illness. But the researchers say their approach has allowed them to look at a natural experiment that occurred in Wales in 2013. That fall, the vaccination program officially began in the country, with clear age restrictions. People born on or after September 2, 1933 (80 years and under) were eligible for at least one year for the shingles vaccine, whereas people born before then were not.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These cut-offs (and the UK’s robust record-keeping) meant the researchers could easily track dementia rates among similar groups of older people right before and after the vaccine became available, with the non-eligible group acting as a sort of control. In a study &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/unique-study-is-latest-to-show-shingles-vaccine-can-prevent-dementia-2000583567"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this April, the researchers found that vaccinated people were 20% less likely to be diagnosed with dementia over a seven-year period.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This time, however, they were interested in seeing whether the vaccine was linked to better outcomes across the different stages of dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using the same method, they found that vaccinated people were less likely to develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the earliest potential stage of dementia (though many with dementia will first experience MCI, not everyone with MCI will go on to have full-blown dementia). And among diagnosed dementia cases, people vaccinated against shingles were also less likely to ultimately die as a result of their condition.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“That means that the vaccine doesn’t just have a preventive potential, but actually a therapeutic potential as a treatment, because we see some benefits already among those who have dementia,” senior study author Pascal Geldsetzer, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/health/shingles-vaccine-dementia-progression-study-wellness"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; CNN. “To me, this was really exciting to see and unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;An already worthwhile vaccine&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;These findings still can’t definitively prove that the shingles vaccine can affect dementia outcomes. That said, the team’s unique method does get around many of the limitations of observational studies. And taken as a whole, the evidence is mounting that the shingles vaccine has more health benefits than we initially realized.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just this past October, for instance, a study &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/shingles-shots-dont-just-prevent-pain-they-might-save-your-life-2000674980"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that people vaccinated for shingles are also less likely to develop heart disease and stroke; they were also less likely to die earlier compared to non-vaccinated individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Shingles is one of the most painful experiences a person can have. And the vaccine is universally recommended for every American starting at age 50. So there’s already plenty of incentive to get your shots (it’s a two-dose vaccine). Lowering your risk of brain and heart disease just seems to be a great bonus, too.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gizmodo</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 21:30:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQZ212RHBsR2ZHa3UyY1RTX3ktZFIwc2lRakdCbnFsSk9iQk0yNEtROHFDMGtNTncxRFBNSG1Hb1A1aGtKUU1UUmpMQW9zM1ZtWnpqUE5wVElBM041Qm1OSXpSYUh6U2FwMXVSck1razNRdVV1TDBlcmVqYllmU0FOX1RjbzVrTkdFR0ZOd3I2c1Q1NXZYRkY3QXo4NG1CYWxIbDYxN0dVbU12Y2c</guid></item><item><title>要阻止RFK Jr. ，需要多少儿童死亡？ - Slate</title><link>https://slate.com/technology/2025/12/hepatitis-b-vaccine-acip-cdc-rfk-jr-doctor-recommendations.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruou8n000o3b790ts5em6v@published"&gt;Over the past year, the agency has lost a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/27/health/cdc-kennedy.html"&gt;third&lt;/a&gt; of its staff. During the government shutdown, the administration &lt;em&gt;tried&lt;/em&gt; to fire hundreds more. Scroll around and you’ll find &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/savehealthresearch/p/DRvuJrLDiby/"&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt; of the notes employees have allegedly been leaving behind. Some simply present data supporting their work, like “1.4 million children are living with HIV.” In the women’s bathroom, though, the messages are reportedly more pointed. They include &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/inside-rfk-jr-cdc-anti-vaccine-guidelines-policy-cuts-director-fired.html"&gt;Post-its&lt;/a&gt; reminding workers that “It’s okay to not be okay.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruoubn000p3b79nrh9imxb@published"&gt;But despite all this, this agency is still going about its business. On Thursday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is set to issue recommendations about the kinds of immunizations infants get, for instance. And there’s nothing any of us can do to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruouej000q3b79k41e01oa@published"&gt;“Anti-vaccine activists like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have been around forever, arguably since the first vaccine, usually shouting from the sidelines, but now they’re not shouting from the sidelines anymore, they’re making policy,” says Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruouhp000r3b79z12tlybp@published"&gt;Former CDC directors, like Rochelle Walensky and Tom Frieden, have said they don’t trust the agency anymore, he notes, “so you can’t look to them, other than with your heart in your throat waiting for the next dangerous, misguided thing they say.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruouk7000s3b79igy9je25@published"&gt;On a &lt;a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/what-next/2025/12/how-rfks-cdc-is-making-america-less-healthy"&gt;recent episode&lt;/a&gt; of What Next, host Mary Harris spoke to Offit about what we can do as Robert F. Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services leans into its anti-vaccine agenda. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruoupj000u3b79grtkcnvo@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Harris: I want to break down exactly what this panel’s going to be talking about. The first day of the meeting, they will talk about the hepatitis B vaccine, which is given at birth to babies. I wonder if you can lay out why this vaccine has been so important.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="135" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruousj000v3b79o72gjfzl@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Offit: &lt;/strong&gt;If your mother has hepatitis B and you then go through a birth canal that is invariably bloody that contains hepatitis B, and you’re then infected by passing through that birth canal, you need to be vaccinated at birth. And the reason is that if you’re not, you have an 85 percent chance of getting hepatitis B, passing through a birth canal that has the virus in it. And if you get it, you have a 90 percent chance of going on to develop chronic liver disease, which is to say cirrhosis or liver cancer, and it shortens your life. And if you get hepatitis B in the first five years of life, you have a 25 percent chance of going on to develop cirrhosis or liver cancer, which will shorten your life.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruouv5000w3b79ra0kihxm@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people would say, “Well, then just test the mother. See if the mother has hepatitis B. If she does, then you vaccinate the baby.” What would you say to that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruouyh000x3b79ga84kccw@published"&gt;Great, but it makes a few assumptions. There’s about a 5 percent false-negative rate, meaning falsely reassuring. Two, it assumes that you haven’t been infected in your second and third trimester. Three, it also assumes that when the child is between 1 and 5 years of age and goes to a day care center, everybody that person comes in contact with at that day care center is not chronically infected.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruov2q000y3b79nt9jnffv@published"&gt;Most people who are chronically infected with hepatitis B in this country, and there are millions, don’t know they’re infected, and they are highly contagious—50 to 100 times more contagious than human immunodeficiency virus, the cause of AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="36" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruov5l000z3b79xwnea7fc@published"&gt;The vaccine is as safe and as effective at birth as it is at two months of age. So why take that risk? Why would you ever take that risk? Because it’s a risk without benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruov8e00103b793u0zkjad@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I noticed that in the past year or so, you’ve been making a point to meet with people you disagree with, people who are leaders in the Make America Healthy Again movement. I wonder what you’ve learned from those conversations. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="18" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovbk00113b795je584yz@published"&gt;Generally, they don’t trust public health officials. They think that there’s a big conspiracy to hide the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="9" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruoveq00123b79u2in6e4r@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you could say anything, and it wouldn’t matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovhk00133b79xh7qzsc8@published"&gt;I don’t think it matters. The conversations were collegial, but at the end of it, they don’t trust me, or they don’t trust people in public health, because they think that we’re lying to them. I don’t know how you get over that hump. There’s not a deep state. There are not forces working against you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovkh00143b79wkfgs0py@published"&gt;The people who are in public health want desperately to get it right. Know that we don’t know everything, and we have to be open-minded as we learn new things. But vaccines don’t cause autism. That’s not a thing to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovnq00153b794l4mny0a@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve said that you think the only thing that will break through to everyday Americans who may be feeling very strongly about vaccines or may have misinformation about vaccines is for kids to get sick, and even to die. I hear you saying something like that, and as a patient and a person, I feel kind of abandoned. I just feel like, &lt;em&gt;Hold it. Families I know are going to have to pay this horrible price?&lt;/em&gt; How would you respond to someone like me? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovqu00163b79u8o5pt1w@published"&gt;This tears me apart. I think that everybody in public health who’s watching what’s going on is horrified by what’s happening. And we’re not the establishment anymore. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the establishment. Anti-vaccine activists are the establishment. They’re the ones that are making policy, and no one’s pushing back.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovts00173b79hbk8g9ce@published"&gt;And so what can we do? Seventy-five Nobel Prize winners decried the appointment or confirmation of RFK Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services. Thousands of doctors have written this. All the professional medical and scientific societies have decried this and written letters about this and had thousands and tens of thousands of signatures. A lot of people go on national television to decry how awful this is. I just feel like we’re screaming into the void.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="28" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovwj00183b79x1xnn21a@published"&gt;And it is such a defeat to think that these children are dying unnecessarily. And so I understand you’re feeling abandoned. I do. I feel the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruovz800193b79yvegt7pa@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I guess I wonder, given our whole conversation and what we’ve said, whether broader action is needed and how you feel about that. How do we mobilize together to create some kind of attentional event, whether it is a strike of health care workers or something else, that would make clear to the country exactly what’s on the line in this moment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruow22001a3b79fk81vyrc@published"&gt;I think what would have the most impact is a parents’ march, where parents all get together—Republican, Democrat, independent—and say, “We are worried about what’s happening to our children. We are worried that vaccines are becoming more expensive, less available, more feared. We’re worried about the future.” This is a fragile market. I don’t think people quite realize how fragile the vaccine market is. It’s something you get once or a few times in your lifetime. It’s never going to compete with drugs you’re taking every day. This is a weak stepchild for these pharmaceutical companies. They can drop vaccines they have. They did. In many ways that is RFK Jr.’s goal. Parents need to stand up.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="20" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruow71001b3b797peehgw7@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If a parent came to you right now and asked for advice in this moment, what would you tell them? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruow8a001c3b799a5benlj@published"&gt;I think there are a lot of different places one can look to get good advice. There’s our Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia, but there are other excellent sources. The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy in Minnesota has excellent information about this upcoming hepatitis B vaccine story.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruowbv001d3b79tpnonf1z@published"&gt;There are a number of places where you can educate yourself. And I do think that it’s still somewhat of a democracy here in this country, and you still can pretty much say what you want, although people seem to be more scared these days. But there’s still a lot of good information out there.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmiruoweg001e3b79ok23vrst@published"&gt;And a lot of people&lt;em&gt; are&lt;/em&gt; standing up. You see academic and professional societies like the American Academy of Pediatrics coming up with their own recommendations based on their own expert advisory groups. Same thing for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Infectious Disease Society of America. You can look to those sites to find accurate evidence-based information. And states are standing up. There are coalitions being formed in the Northeast and Northwest about how to have your own expert advisers. In Pennsylvania, Gov. Josh Shapiro is looking into creating a vaccine for children program that can provide vaccines to uninsured or underinsured children, because they don’t trust the CDC.&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention unexpectedly postponed controversial votes Thursday on changes to the current recommendation of universally immunizing newborns against hepatitis B. Confusion and disagreement over the language of the votes led the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, to push them to Friday.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee meeting was marked by unusual conflict and chaos.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is the third version of the questions that we have received in 72 hours, and we're trying to evaluate a moving target," said Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, a psychiatrist and voting member of the committee. "I protest the description that the ACIP members have been consulted in developing these questions."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The vote was intended to focus on ending a longstanding recommendation to vaccinate all healthy newborns against hepatitis B, regardless of whether the mother tests positive or negative for the virus. But the language of the vote was changed between the time it was posted Friday morning to the early afternoon and some members of the group wanted more time to consider it in writing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The current recommendation is intended to make sure no at-risk infant falls through the cracks, and to confer lifelong protection for all U.S. children against the hepatitis B virus, which can cause serious, potentially fatal health problems. It is the cornerstone of a decades-long strategy &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2841644" target="_blank"&gt;to eliminate hepatitis B&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B, which is often spread through sexual contact and drug use, can be transmitted from mothers to infants during childbirth, and in infancy through contact with an infected person's body fluids, such as their blood.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The virus attacks the liver and chronic infection can lead to liver cancer, cirrhosis and death. The risks of these outcomes are much higher for people who get infected as infants. There's no cure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Thursday's discussion, there was a pronounced split between some of the attendees who spoke in favor of changing the recommendation and others who were against a change.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Tracy Beth Høeg, a representative for the Food and Drug Administration, questioned the need for the current universal policy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Babies who are born without high risk factors, without a mother who is antigen positive, without a family member who has hepatitis B – for these babies, the potential for benefit is so low," said Høeg, who was named as acting director for the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research on Thursday. "Why are we stating that it is absolutely necessary to give this dose at birth, when high income nations throughout the world are not?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine, defended the current policy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This disease has gone down in the United States, thanks to the effectiveness of our current immunization program," said Meissner, who is the only current member that has served on the committee in the past. When challenged by another adviser, Robert Malone, a vaccinologist and biochemist, to caveat this statement as his "opinion," he replied: "These are facts, Robert."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nonvoting liaisons from medical professional groups spoke out against the process, which deviates from how ACIP usually works.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As physicians, your ethical obligation is to 'first, do no harm' and you are failing in that by promoting this anti-vaccine agenda without the data and evidence necessary to make those informed decisions," said Dr. Jason Goldman, a liaison for the American College of Physicians. "Your job as a committee is to look at the totality of the risks and benefits, the harms, the equity, which you have not done."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The postponement leads to a packed agenda on Friday. In addition to the vote to change the hepatitis B policy, the committee is scheduled to discuss how the U.S. vaccine schedule compares to that of other countries, and the links between aluminum – an ingredient used in more than a dozen vaccines to make them more effective – and asthma.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Most medical professionals say there's no good evidence that aluminum adjuvants are unsafe and ample evidence that they pose no real concern.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many public health experts are concerned that this week's moves are part of a concerted effort to undermine vaccine access in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC's advisory committee wields enormous power because its recommendations influence how doctors vaccinate patients and dictate whether insurance companies pay for shots.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the committee has lost the trust of most mainstream medical groups since Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/25/nx-s1-5438482/cdc-vaccine-committee-acip-meeting-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;replaced its members in June&lt;/a&gt; with his own slate. The committee has also abandoned longstanding collaborations with medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics and draws less on the experience of CDC experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-guts-acip-cdc-vaccine-panel-rcna211935" target="_blank"&gt;fired in June&lt;/a&gt; and replaced with a group that has largely expressed skepticism of vaccines — once again delayed an expected &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-advisers-reverse-newborn-hepatitis-b-vaccine-recommendations-rcna246812" target="_blank"&gt;vote on hepatitis B vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-50246d" class="body-graf"&gt;Because of disagreements and confusion over the voting language, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's panel, formally known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, decided to push the vote to Friday morning instead of holding it Thursday afternoon as scheduled. The committee had previously tabled a September vote on the hepatitis B vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2fa06d" class="body-graf"&gt;The meeting was, in numerous ways, a radical departure from past practices. Typically, the ACIP evaluates new vaccines or new indications for them, not shots that have been administered in the same way for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f8c24" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC has for 34 years recommended that all newborns get a first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. But the panel is considering whether to roll back that guidance and instead suggest that women who test negative for hepatitis B decide in consultation with a health care provider whether their baby should get the dose at birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4a3d2b" class="body-graf"&gt;If adopted, that recommendation would go against widespread consensus among public health experts, who before the meeting issued loud pleas not to change the hepatitis B vaccination schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9cd393" class="body-graf"&gt;On Thursday, the advisory panel convened in the CDC’s broadcast studio, under bright lights and in front of large television cameras, instead of its typical conference room — giving the appearance of a televised show rather than a scientific discussion. When asked about the venue, Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said it was meant to “accommodate increased public interest in the committee.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-08f313" class="body-graf"&gt;The proceedings featured a barrage of misleading claims and cherry-picked data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2acbd5" class="body-graf"&gt;Several presenters and panel members claimed there was limited evidence of the hepatitis B vaccine’s safety or efficacy, ignoring decades of evidence to the contrary. At past meetings, the CDC’s medical experts have presented data on the risks of a given disease and the safety and efficacy of vaccines that target it. But the presentations Thursday were instead given by two anti-vaccine activists and a climate scientist who has written for an anti-vaccine publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8cf0bb" class="body-graf"&gt;The meeting was the most blatant example to date of how far the panel has strayed from its original mission to consider who should get vaccines — and when — based on a complete scientific analysis of the risks and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-05646b" class="body-graf"&gt;In a presentation on safety, anti-vaccine activist Mark Blaxill — a businessman and author with no medical credentials who was recently hired at the CDC — suggested that symptoms identified in babies who got the hepatitis B vaccine, such as fatigue, weakness, diarrhea or irritability were “possibly connected” to swelling of the brain, or encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bbe5af" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner, the only ACIP member who has previously served on the committee, pushed back: “That is absolutely not encephalitis,” he said. “That’s not a statement that a physician would make. They are not related to encephalitis, and you can’t say that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f59be7" class="body-graf"&gt;By early afternoon, multiple members of the committee expressed confusion over what they were voting on and pointed to issues with the voting language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c58dc3" class="body-graf"&gt;“Perhaps this was written by the department of redundancy department,” quipped ACIP member Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bc9a0b" class="body-graf"&gt;The panel’s chair, Dr. Kirk Milhoan, was not present for the decision to postpone the hepatitis B vote. Vice chair Dr. Robert Malone said Milhoan was “about to jump on a plane to go to Asia and would not be available, I believe, for [the discussion] tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-b049eb"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1666" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251204-cdc-malone-inline-jg-aaba27.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251204-cdc-malone-inline-jg-aaba27.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251204-cdc-malone-inline-jg-aaba27.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251204-cdc-malone-inline-jg-aaba27.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251204-cdc-malone-inline-jg-aaba27.jpg" alt="US Vaccine Panel Poised To Delay Hepatitis B Shots For Newborns"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Committee member Dr. Robert Malone at Thursday's meeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Megan Varner / Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-908310" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, commented during the meeting that the proceedings amounted to “political theater.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2f98f" class="body-graf"&gt;“You are wasting taxpayer dollars by not having scientific, rigorous discussion on issues that truly matter,” Goldman said. “The best thing you can do is adjourn the meeting and discuss vaccine issues that actually need to be taken up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ad3349" class="body-graf"&gt;Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1996564037497491520" target="_blank"&gt;said on X&lt;/a&gt; before the meeting began that the advisory panel is “totally discredited” and “not protecting children.” Cassidy, a liver doctor who treated patients with hepatitis B, chairs the Senate’s health committee and cast a key vote in favor of confirming Kennedy as health secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8236c0" class="body-graf"&gt;Hepatitis B is an incurable infection that can lead to liver disease, cancer and death. The virus can be transmitted from mother to child during delivery, and not all pregnant women get tested for it. So public health experts say that delaying the shots could lead to more infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-470a71" class="body-graf"&gt;The prevailing medical consensus is that hepatitis B vaccines are overwhelmingly safe, based on decades of real-world data. A CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of children born from 1994 to 2023 estimated that hepatitis B vaccination prevented more than 6 million infections and nearly 1 million hospitalizations.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-613d59" class="body-graf"&gt;In addition to its vote on hepatitis B vaccines Friday, the CDC advisory panel is also expected to discuss the entire childhood immunization schedule, as well as the presence of aluminum salts found in many childhood vaccines, which help boost the immune response and reduce the number of required doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74a245" class="body-graf"&gt;Both are hot-button topics among anti-vaccine activists, who often argue that children receive too many vaccines and that aluminum salts in them increases the risk of autoimmune conditions or neurodevelopmental disorders. Neither claim is supported by scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c8077e" class="body-graf"&gt;Aaron Siri, an anti-vaccine lawyer who has represented Kennedy, is expected to give a presentation Friday. Siri has advocated for the Food and Drug Administration to revoke its approval of the polio vaccine.

&lt;p&gt;There’s new progress in the battle against Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;About 1 in 9 US seniors&lt;/a&gt; has Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia, which slowly impairs memory, thinking skills and the ability to perform even basic tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is no single, easy test to diagnose Alzheimer’s, but a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2842195" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new review&lt;/a&gt; of 18 scientific studies confirms that a simple blood test can detect early signs of the brain disorder before &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/12/health/4-warning-signs-that-may-indicate-early-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;cognitive symptoms&lt;/a&gt; appear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Alzheimer’s disease gradually destroys memory, thinking skills and the ability to perform even basic tasks. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;WavebreakMediaMicro – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The protein p-tau217 has become a reliable Alzheimer’s biomarker because its concentration in the blood is strongly linked to the presence of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain, two hallmarks of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research out this week in JAMA Neurology supports the use of p-tau217 blood tests as a “minimally invasive tool” for early identification of Alzheimer’s, “particularly in settings where timely intervention with disease-modifying therapies may offer the greatest benefit in slowing or preventing disease progression.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/liron-sinvani-md" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Liron Sinvani&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Geriatric Hospitalist Service at Northwell Health and director of research for hospital medicine, called the finding “a major breakthrough.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Just a simple blood test to see if this protein, this p-tau217, is present can indicate that someone is at a very high risk of having dementia right before symptoms even start,” said Sinvani, who was not involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is definitely a big finding in terms of, ‘OK. Can we identify people before they even have symptoms of dementia?'”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Blood tests are an up-and-coming method for identifying Alzheimer’s. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Yakobchuk Olena – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dementia symptoms can include memory loss, difficulties with familiar tasks, communication troubles, disorientation, poor judgment and mood or personality changes.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;An assessment of symptoms is used to diagnose Alzheimer’s, along with a review of health history and physical and neurological exams. Brain imaging and a spinal fluid analysis can help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blood tests are an up-and-coming method for identifying Alzheimer’s, with the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;US Food and Drug Administration recently approving&lt;/a&gt; new blood testing for people 55 and older experiencing symptoms like memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;P-tau217 blood tests typically require a doctor’s order, though &lt;a href="https://truehealthlabs.com/phosphorylated-tau-217-ptau217/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one sells online for $229&lt;/a&gt; with the promise that “no doctor or insurance is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new JAMA review, which included data from over 7,800 people, found that p-tau217 levels were much higher in amyloid-positive people than in amyloid-negative people, even though these individuals had no cognitive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dementia symptoms can include memory loss, difficulties with familiar tasks, communication troubles, disorientation, poor judgment and mood or personality changes. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;LIGHTFIELD STUDIOS – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amyloid plaques are clumps of misfolded proteins in the brain that can disrupt brain function.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It’s a tell-tale sign of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem is that there’s no cure for amyloid plaques in the brain, though there are treatments that can reduce them in the early stages of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“The question in my mind is, at this moment, how many people would want to know that they have this biomarker and have a high risk of dementia?” Sinvani mused.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The reason why this isn’t ready for primetime is because we don’t have medications right now that would be offered,” she continued, “but the goal is that if we can identify people early enough, before they even start having symptoms, then we can potentially, hopefully as medications develop, be able to introduce medications that can prevent or slow down the progression.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While there is no cure for Alzheimer’s, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/28/health/alzheimers-risk-declines-sharply-with-one-daily-lifestyle-change-researchers-say/"&gt;lifestyle changes&lt;/a&gt; can lower the risk or potentially slow progression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A healthy diet, exercise, increased socialization, making connections and keeping your brain active,” Sinvani said, “these are all things that can impact the trajectory of dementia, and so, knowing that you are at very high risk could be a nice way to sort of incentivize people to start doing something about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="7e03b13f-6208-4cc5-92b5-78cd070142cd"&gt;Researchers think they may have found a way to reverse "lazy eye," even in adults who've typically had the condition since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technique has so far been tested only in animals, though, so it needs further study before it can be used in human patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="7e03b13f-6208-4cc5-92b5-78cd070142cd-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;A lazy eye, or amblyopia, develops when the brain favors one eye over the other &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lazy-eye/symptoms-causes/syc-20352391" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lazy-eye/symptoms-causes/syc-20352391" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in early childhood&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, causing vision in the less-favored &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/what-are-eyes-made-of" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/what-are-eyes-made-of"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eye&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to decline. The standard treatment involves placing a patch over the stronger eye to force the brain to rely on the weaker one. However, this method is effective only during infancy and early childhood, when the neural connections that regulate vision are still being formed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="2346838d-9866-4817-8d4f-c541c97aa02c"&gt;Now, a mouse study published Nov. 25 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)01338-5" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)01338-5" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; introduces a method for temporarily shutting down the weak eye, which can lead to recovery from amblyopia, even after long-term vision issues. "Rebooting" the lazy eye seems to come from a burst of activity in neurons that pass visual signals from the retina to the visual cortex, a hub for processing visual information in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The finding that inactivation of the amblyopic eye enables vision recovery in a mouse model of amblyopia is encouraging," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-vision-science/profile/b7thomps" target="_blank" data-url="https://uwaterloo.ca/optometry-vision-science/profile/b7thomps" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ben Thompson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor and the director of the School of Optometry and Vision Science at the University of Waterloo in Canada, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more research is needed to see whether the method will be safe and effective in humans, too, Thompson told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://optometry.berkeley.edu/people/dennis-m-levi-od-phd/" target="_blank" data-url="https://optometry.berkeley.edu/people/dennis-m-levi-od-phd/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Dennis Levi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of optometry and vision science at the University of California, Berkeley who was not involved in the study, was also cautiously optimistic about the findings. Historically, scientists have tried various methods of reversing lazy eye in mice, but they "failed to produce significant improvements in humans with amblyopia," he told Live Science in an email. But this new technique seems to hold promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-cnKEhdo8WE3US9KxxTNetF" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-cnKEhdo8WE3US9KxxTNetF slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how might temporarily shutting down the weak eye help to restore its vision?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/70023" target="_blank" data-url="https://elifesciences.org/articles/70023" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Earlier work&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from MIT neuroscientist &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bearlab.mit.edu/mark-bear/" target="_blank" data-url="https://bearlab.mit.edu/mark-bear/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mark Bear&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues showed that anesthetizing the non-lazy eye triggered visual recovery in the lazy eye in older animals, including cats and mice. Similar results have been &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2799527" target="_blank" data-url="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2799527" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;found&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2799528" target="_blank" data-url="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2799528" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in monkeys&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which may spell good news for humans, Levi noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the team hypothesized that blocking input from one retina causes neurons to fire in synchronized bursts in the thalamus, a part of the brain that handles incoming sensory information. Specifically, these bursts are seen in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), part of the brain that relays information from the eyes to the visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar bursts happen in the LGN before birth and help the visual system develop in the womb. That led the team to wonder whether re-creating this early activity pattern could help treat amblyopia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tried injecting a local &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/33731-anesthesia-work.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/33731-anesthesia-work.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;anesthetic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; called tetrodotoxin (TTX) into the retinas of mice and then monitored the rodents' LGN neurons. TTX is a neurotoxin found in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507714/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507714/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;animals like pufferfish&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it also has &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8402337/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8402337/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;potential therapeutic uses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including anesthesia and the treatment of severe pain. Research into these uses in humans is ongoing, but in the context of this study, TTX was useful for rebooting the retinas of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that shutting down either eye triggered the same burst pattern in the LGN. In a second experiment, they genetically modified the mice so their LGN neurons couldn't produce this burst firing. The activity stopped, and the anesthetic treatment no longer improved amblyopia. That showed that the bursts themselves were crucial for recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the team tested whether they could treat amblyopia by inactivating only the weak eye. They ran an experiment in which some mice with amblyopia got an injection in their weak eye while others did not. The injection stopped the retina from sending signals for about two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="814b5813-4ed3-486e-b8a4-a9895cb72e39"&gt;A week after the injection, the scientists measured how much each eye influenced activity in the visual cortex and found that the treated mice had a much more balanced input from both eyes than the untreated mice did. This showed that shutting down the weak eye for a short time helped it "catch up" with the other eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson said this result is encouraging "because the fellow eye does not have to be exposed to any risks of the treatment." But he emphasized that "more work is needed to assess whether tetrodotoxin will be safe and effective in humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that the effects of TTX on amblyopia generalize to cats and monkeys, raising hope that the approach may one day help humans as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery that burst firing can help boost the brain's ability to rewire and form new networks is "extremely interesting," Thompson said. Noninvasive tools used to stimulate the brain might eventually be harnessed to trigger similar neural responses, without the need for TTX injections, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="049c6ea2-bde5-4d76-a0fd-05dd95744052"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick and easy breath test to detect the difficult-to-diagnose pancreatic cancer is being trialed nationally in the UK with huge expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer has a high mortality rate among cancers because of the tendency to discover it at later stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has never been a breath test authorized by a major regulatory body like the British NIH or US Food and Drug Administration, but the initiative has far bigger aspirations than simply setting milestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analysis of pancreatic cancer across the UK found that over 60% of cases are detected at stage 4. At this point, there’s not much to be done, and indeed, the same analysis found only 22% of patients diagnosed at this stage survive even a month beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to diagnose in part because it manifests in vague symptoms like backpain and indigestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imperial College London and Pancreatic Cancer UK are teaming up to launch a major trial of a new breath testing device in 40 different locations across the Scotland, Wales, and England, with a target for 6,000 patients. The breath test will detect volatile organic compounds, or VOCs that are linked with pancreatic cancer; even in early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of these VOCs travel around the bloodstream and can be expelled in a single breath. An analysis of the entire collection can pinpoint to cancer from other potential infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANCER TESTING IMPROVEMENTS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The breath test has the potential to revolutionize the early detection of pancreatic cancer. It is, undoubtedly, the most significant step toward a lifesaving breakthrough in 50 years,” &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/pancreatic-cancer-breath-test-nhs-b2854162.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Diana Jupp, chief executive of Pancreatic Cancer UK which is funding the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While more years of development are still needed before we can put this exciting new technology into the hands of GPs across the country, thousands of patients with an unknown diagnosis will now help refine it in the real-world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the first pancreatic cancer breath test to ever reach a national clinical trial of this scale. That in itself makes this a moment of real, tangible hope.”&lt;/p&gt;

The findings suggest that children who are highly sensitive to everyday stimuli may unknowingly regulate their neural networks to cope with overwhelming sights and sounds. The study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s11689-025-09656-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensory processing challenges are a frequent concern for parents and clinicians. These issues often manifest as sensory over-responsivity. Children with this condition experience intense physical or emotional reactions to stimuli that others might find harmless or mundane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common triggers include the texture of clothing seams, the sound of a vacuum cleaner, or bright fluorescent lights. While these reactions are often observed in children with autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, they also occur in children without a specific diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biological mechanisms behind these intense reactions have remained largely elusive. Diagnosis currently relies on caregiver reports and clinical observations rather than biological markers. To address this gap, a team of researchers sought to map the neural underpinnings of sensory over-responsivity. They aimed to understand how different brain systems interact when a child processes sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by a multidisciplinary team. The lead investigators included Pratik Mukherjee, a professor of radiology and biomedical imaging, and Elysa Marco, a pediatric neurologist. Both are affiliated with the University of California, San Francisco. They collaborated with researchers from Cortica Healthcare and other institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators based their analysis on a framework of two opposing brain systems. They categorized these as exogenous and endogenous systems. The exogenous system involves brain networks that face outward. It includes regions responsible for processing vision, touch, and movement. This system helps the brain interpret raw data coming from the external environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the endogenous system focuses inward. It includes networks responsible for attention, decision-making, and emotional regulation. This system handles higher-level cognitive tasks. It allows an individual to plan actions, control impulses, and attribute meaning to experiences. The researchers hypothesized that the balance between these two systems might look different in children who struggle with sensory regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis, the team recruited 83 children between the ages of 8 and 12. All participants were recruited from a community neurodevelopment center. They screened the children to ensure they were neurodiverse, meaning they had a high likelihood of a developmental condition such as ADHD or learning differences. However, the researchers specifically excluded children with a confirmed autism diagnosis to reduce variability in the sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians assessed the children using a structured evaluation called the Sensory Processing 3 Dimensions Assessment. Based on this direct observation, the children were divided into two groups. One group consisted of 39 children who exhibited sensory over-responsivity. The second group consisted of 44 neurodiverse children who did not show these specific sensory sensitivities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging to scan the brains of all participants. They employed a technique known as resting-state functional MRI. This method measures spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity while the subject is at rest. It allows scientists to see which brain regions are communicating with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The imaging results revealed a striking divergence between the two groups. In the children with sensory over-responsivity, the researchers observed a reduction in connectivity within the exogenous networks. Specifically, the areas of the brain dedicated to vision and motor control showed lower levels of local synchronization. It appeared as though the brain was dampening its connection to the sensory world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, these same children showed elevated connectivity within the endogenous networks. The brain regions associated with attention and cognitive control were highly active and synchronized. This pattern created a distinct neural signature. The inward-facing systems were dialed up, while the outward-facing systems were dialed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neurodiverse children without sensory issues displayed the exact opposite pattern. In this group, the exogenous sensory networks were highly connected. Conversely, their endogenous regulation networks showed lower levels of connectivity. This created a clear “double dissociation” between the two groups. The functional organization of their brains appeared to be diametrically opposed depending on their sensory responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This contrast was evident in both long-range and local brain connections. Long-range connectivity refers to communication between distant brain regions. Local connectivity refers to synchronization among neighboring neurons. The study found that children with sensory over-responsivity had generally weaker long-range connections across the brain. However, the local hyper-connectivity in their regulatory networks was a standout feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined the structural integrity of the brain’s white matter. White matter acts as the cabling that connects different brain regions. Using diffusion tensor imaging, the team found that children with sensory sensitivities had reduced structural integrity in specific pathways. These pathways included the posterior thalamic radiations, which carry visual information, and the internal capsule, which carries touch and motor signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the practical implications of these brain patterns, the researchers looked at behavioral data. They assessed how well the children managed their emotions in daily life. They classified the children as either “resilient” or “dysregulated” based on parent reports. Resilient children were better at adapting to change and recovering from setbacks. Dysregulated children struggled more with anger and emotional control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that the distinct brain pattern—low sensory connectivity and high regulatory connectivity—was strongest in the resilient children with sensory over-responsivity. This suggests that the brain pattern may be an adaptive mechanism. A child who is easily overwhelmed by sensory input might subconsciously suppress their sensory networks to reduce the noise. At the same time, they may upregulate their cognitive control networks to maintain composure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the dysregulated children, this distinct separation of brain systems was less apparent. Their brain activity did not show the same clear compensatory shift. This implies that the ability to modulate these two systems is linked to better emotional and behavioral outcomes. The unique neural signature identified by the researchers seems to be a marker of successful coping in the face of sensory overload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pratik Mukherjee noted the logic behind this physiological response. He explained, “We think that when you are overstimulated by sensory input, you compensate by dialing up your brain’s inward-focused networks to gain self-control. You also dial down your outward-focused networks to minimize sensory input.” He added that children who are not overwhelmed do not need to employ this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team also tested whether these brain patterns could be used for diagnosis. They utilized machine learning algorithms to analyze the imaging data. By combining functional MRI data with structural white matter data, the algorithms could classify children with high accuracy. The model distinguished between children with and without sensory over-responsivity with nearly 90 percent accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This high level of classification suggests that sensory over-responsivity has a robust biological basis. It is not merely a behavioral preference or a symptom of other conditions. It involves measurable changes in how the brain is wired and how it functions. The ability to identify these markers could eventually lead to objective diagnostic tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several caveats to consider regarding this research. The sample size of 83 children is relatively small for a neuroimaging study. The findings will need to be replicated in larger, independent cohorts to ensure they are distinct and universal. Additionally, the study excluded children with autism. Since sensory issues are highly prevalent in autism, it remains unknown if these specific findings apply to that population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cross-sectional nature of the study also limits conclusions about cause and effect. The researchers looked at the children at a single point in time. It is not yet clear when these brain patterns emerge in development. Longitudinal studies following children from infancy through adolescence would be necessary to track how these networks develop. Such studies could determine if the brain patterns precede the sensory issues or develop as a response to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research directions include investigating how these brain networks respond to treatment. Occupational therapy is a common intervention for sensory processing challenges. Researchers could use these imaging techniques to see if therapy changes brain connectivity. If the brain pattern is indeed a coping mechanism, successful therapy might alter the need for such strong downregulation of sensory networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s11689-025-09656-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A neural substrate for sensory over-responsivity defined by exogenous and endogenous brain systems&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Hannah L.

(WMTV) - A beloved Madison holiday tradition took a dramatic turn when quick-thinking friends saved a volunteer’s life after she suffered a rare medical emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Annie Gibneski has been part of the core group stringing lights along &lt;a href="https://www.wmtv15news.com/2025/10/30/volunteers-needed-beloved-holiday-tradition-madison/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.wmtv15news.com/2025/10/30/volunteers-needed-beloved-holiday-tradition-madison/"&gt;University Avenue trees for years,&lt;/a&gt; signaling the season’s arrival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The tradition features an organized pattern in colors of threes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;The beloved annual University Avenue Holiday Lights have been running for 29 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-credit"&gt;(wmtv)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“We have a core group of at least 15 of us that have shown up for many many years,” Gibneski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.wmtv15news.com/2025/11/01/university-ave-holiday-lights-return-spread-winter-joy/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.wmtv15news.com/2025/11/01/university-ave-holiday-lights-return-spread-winter-joy/"&gt;on Nov. 1, &lt;/a&gt;Gibneski — always first to show up and last to leave — was missing from the familiar gathering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Volunteers return to set up holiday lights alongside University Avenue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-credit"&gt;(WMTV)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Volunteer Richard Jung noticed something was wrong during a walkthrough of the lighting setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“I did a brief walkthrough and I noticed that Annie wasn’t here, and I found that really unusual because she finds this to be something she lives for, she’s pretty passionate about,” Jung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Chris Kammer, who has been organizing the light display for 29 years in honor of his late father Dr. Jack Kammer, also found her absence concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“She’s always here. She talks about this all year long so that was really odd,” Kammer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Then came troubling text messages from Gibneski — strings of words that didn’t make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“I was texting Chris and Rich — charged, school, changed, closed, you are? Are you?” Gibneski recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Worried something was deeply wrong, longtime friend Kammer headed to Gibneski’s home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“He stood on my front lawn with his arms crossed saying ‘I’m not going anywhere.’ He was ringing my doorbell, calling me, pounding on the front door. And I came out to my balcony ‘I said I’m fine I just need some more sleep,’” Gibneski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Airing on the side of caution, Kammer called for backup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Should I just kick the door down, it’s weird but you just wonder, like is someone alright in there...and I decided to call 9-1-1,” Kammer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Paramedics arrived moments later and eventually convinced Gibneski to step outside and let them help her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“I didn’t even know my birthday when they asked me,” Gibneski shared. “I ended up in the ambulance and was taken straight to UW.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Gibneski spent nearly a week in the hospital as doctors searched for the cause of her sudden decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“She had a stroke workup done. They imaged her brain. We were trying to figure out if there were any medications causing it,” said Claire Strangstalien, a UW Health hospitalist physician assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Strangstalien explained the possibility of a rare diagnosis — Mollaret’s meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“A rare neurologic disease in which you have periods of symptom free living normally and then recurrent episodes of meningitis typically caused by a virus,” Strangstalien said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;This episode marked the third time in Gibneski’s life she had battled meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“I really believe someone was looking out after me...because I am one lucky person. It feels weird that I might not have been here,” Gibneski choked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Weeks later, the three friends, Madison West graduates, found their way back to simple routines and the place that brought them together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Weeks after Annie was discharged from the hospital the three friends went back to the lights for the final tweaks of the season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-credit"&gt;(Chris Kammer)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“She’s been spreading love and care, sharing her heart her whole life. Beyond anybody I know. She’s kind of almost that unicorn angel that is so amazing. So if Rich and I got a chance to be apart of the miracle that she deserved we couldn’t be happier,” Kammer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“I’m going to celebrate being alive,” Gibneski said. “And I got a lot more living to do on this planet. So I guess they weren’t ready for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;If you’d like to make a donation to keep the lights on for the &lt;a href="https://universityavenueholidaylights.com/donate-2" target="_self" rel="" title="https://universityavenueholidaylights.com/donate-2"&gt;annual tradition, see here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:TLPFVHQR55F3XGVH6XUJG3UMWU" data-fusion-component="TLPFVHQR55F3XGVH6XUJG3UMWU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:TLPFVHQR55F3XGVH6XUJG3UMWU" data-fusion-component="TLPFVHQR55F3XGVH6XUJG3UMWU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="header | article-header w-100"&gt;Understanding meningitis - signs, treatment and prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Types and treatment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“So there’s two types of meningitis. There’s infectious and non-infectious. And infectious causes are more common, most common being viral. But there also can be bacterial meningitis, which can be fatal if left untreated,” said Claire Strangstalien, a UW Health physician assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“It’s a very serious condition that requires antibiotics. In her [Gibneski] case, if she did have something like bacterial meningitis that we were empirically treating for, meaning we just put her on antibiotics when she came in, she could have died from that. But we did determine it was from a virus, fortunately,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Strangstalien said viral meningitis is typically self-limited, meaning it can get better without specific treatment with supportive care. In Gibneski’s case, doctors had an antiviral available to help treat the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“So if she, you know, if she did have a more serious form of the meningitis going on, which she certainly could have, and we didn’t know at that time when she was altered, that could have certainly been fatal. But fortunately, we were able to determine it was from a virus. And kind of that helped us lead into her diagnosis of probable Mollaret meningitis that our infectious disease team picked up on,” Strangstalien said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning signs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Signs to look out for is this classic triad of headache, neck stiffness and fevers,” Strangstalien said. “Other common symptoms we see are sensitivity to light or noise, nausea, vomiting, confusion, or having an altered mental status, such as in this case. Less frequently, we can also see seizures or coma, but that’s much less frequent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prevention&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Strangstalien emphasized the importance of vaccination as a prevention tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“We do have vaccines that help prevent different types of meningitis. And there’s no one vaccine that can prevent meningitis because it’s caused by so many different things. But we do have multiple vaccines that protect against bacterial meningitis, which is a very serious form of meningitis and can be fatal if left untreated,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;She also recommended basic precautions such as hand hygiene and staying home when sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="header | article-header w-100"&gt;Meningitis Cases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Public Health Madison &amp;amp; Dane County update their &lt;a href="https://publichealthmdc.com/for-providers/reportable-disease-data" target="_self" rel="" title="https://publichealthmdc.com/for-providers/reportable-disease-data"&gt;Reportable Disease Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; to track current cases of meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;WMTV also reached out to University Health Services for a look at what cases on the UW Madison campus have reflected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;University Health Services Director of Medical Services, Andrew O’Donnell has shared the following information: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="blockquote | article-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-2"&gt;Please note that viral meningitis is distinct from and less serious than &lt;a href="https://links.us1.defend.egress.com/Warning?crId=691cee432b1f656ff10dd75c&amp;amp;Domain=gray.tv&amp;amp;Threat=eNpzrShJLcpLzAEADmkDRA%3D%3D&amp;amp;Lang=en&amp;amp;Base64Url=eNpFyUsOgCAMBNAT2dl7m1IJNOFjZLTXd8nbvkre6wQiQuwyKfNDz8NHcfqCpvkSSY35cW3HLqns7QfiJhfQ&amp;amp;@OriginalLink=www.cdc.gov" rel="" title="https://links.us1.defend.egress.com/Warning?crId=691cee432b1f656ff10dd75c&amp;amp;Domain=gray.tv&amp;amp;Threat=eNpzrShJLcpLzAEADmkDRA%3D%3D&amp;amp;Lang=en&amp;amp;Base64Url=eNpFyUsOgCAMBNAT2dl7m1IJNOFjZLTXd8nbvkre6wQiQuwyKfNDz8NHcfqCpvkSSY35cW3HLqns7QfiJhfQ&amp;amp;@OriginalLink=www.cdc.gov"&gt;bacterial meningitis.&lt;/a&gt; Viral meningitis is the most common type of meningitis and is usually milder than bacterial meningitis. Most people recover fully with rest and supportive care at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Between October 24 and November 10&lt;/b&gt;, nine students were diagnosed with viral meningitis. All students received prompt medical care and are recovering at home. In late October, University Health Services shared a message with campus to increase awareness of symptoms and preventive measures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-2"&gt;We encourage anyone with meningitis symptoms—including a severe headache, rash, light sensitivity, confusion, or stiff neck—to see a healthcare provider right away, since viral and bacterial meningitis can present similarly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="text | text-start article-text"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbc15.com/page/find-nbc15-news-wherever-you-are/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Click here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="copyright |"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 WMTV.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="investigationandresults" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Investigation and Results"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Investigation and Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Notification of Rabies Case&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 27, 2025, CDC was notified of possible rabies virus infection in a kidney transplant recipient (&lt;a id="F1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#F1_down"&gt;Figure&lt;/a&gt;). After CDC confirmed diagnosis, jurisdictional health departments and CDC conducted an investigation to determine the source of the infection and to identify other persons at risk. This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Kidney Recipient&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, an adult male Michigan resident received a left kidney transplant from an Idaho donor at an Ohio hospital. Approximately 5 weeks later, the recipient experienced tremors, lower extremity weakness, confusion, and urinary incontinence. Seven days after symptom onset, he was hospitalized with fever, hydrophobia, dysphagia, and autonomic instability. On hospital day 2, he required invasive mechanical ventilation. On hospital day 4, clinicians consulted the Ohio Department of Health and CDC because the recipient’s signs and symptoms were compatible with rabies. The Donor Risk Assessment Interview (DRAI) questionnaire reported that the donor had received a skunk scratch. The kidney recipient’s saliva, nuchal skin biopsy, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid samples, collected on hospital days 3–6, were sent to CDC for rabies testing. On hospital day 7, the recipient died; postmortem brain tissue samples were sent to CDC. Rabies virus RNA was detected in saliva, nuchal skin, and brain tissue samples. Rabies virus immunoglobulin (Ig) M, IgG, and neutralizing antibodies were detected in serum. Viral characterization was consistent with the silver-haired bat (&lt;i&gt;Lasionycteris noctivagans&lt;/i&gt;) rabies virus variant. Michigan public health officials interviewed the kidney recipient’s family; no animal exposures were reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Idaho Organ Donor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After rabies was suspected, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, the local public health district, and CDC investigated the Idaho donor as the possible infection source. Interviews with the family added details not included in the DRAI questionnaire. In late October 2024, a skunk approached the donor as he held a kitten in an outbuilding on his rural property. During an encounter that rendered the skunk unconscious, the donor sustained a shin scratch that bled, but he did not think he had been bitten. According to the family, the donor attributed the skunk’s behavior to predatory aggression toward the kitten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A member of the donor’s household reported that approximately 5 weeks later, in early December, the donor was confused, had difficulty swallowing and walking, experienced hallucinations, and had a stiff neck. Two days after symptom onset, he was found unresponsive at home after presumed cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated and hospitalized but never regained consciousness. He was declared brain dead and removed from life support on hospital day 5. Left kidney, heart, lungs, and both corneas were recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After rabies was suspected in the kidney recipient, stored serum that had been collected from the donor on his third hospital day was tested and determined to be negative for rabies virus antibody. A multiweek laboratory traceback investigation identified right and left kidney biopsy samples. CDC detected rabies virus RNA consistent with a silver-haired bat rabies virus variant in a biopsy sample of the right kidney, suggesting organ-derived transmission. The left kidney biopsy sample had insufficient tissue for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Donor Corneal Tissues and Tissue Recipients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four ocular grafts were prepared from recovered corneas. Three patients, one each from California, Idaho, and New Mexico, received grafts in December 2024 and January 2025. While investigation of the donor’s rabies status was ongoing, the cornea recipients underwent precautionary graft removal and received PEP. They remained asymptomatic. A planned transplantation of the fourth corneal graft to a Missouri patient was cancelled. CDC detected rabies virus RNA consistent with a silver-haired bat rabies virus variant in one previously implanted corneal graft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Donor Heart and Lungs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart and lungs of the donor were not transplanted but were used in training procedures at a Maryland medical research facility. By the time of the public health investigation, no specimens were available for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="comment"&gt;&lt;div class="commtext c00"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I only have so many comments before idiotic rate limiting. But I'll comment here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So for dis-ease or dis-ability, it doesnt interfere with ease of life. Nor does it materially affect my ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; I would add several sensory issues (for me it's noises, multiple conversations at the same time, stickiness, physical contact, whole categories of food and several others) and several social issues to your list of superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And too true. I have some as you listed as well. However, I also figured out what causes them in me, and how to reduce their effects to nil. In a way, its self-treatment with n=1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noise: I dont have a problem with noise per se. However, when multiple people are talking or music with lyrics are on in the background, its incredibly hard for me to process what's spoken along with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weirdly though, when I was principal clarinettist in a symphony, I could easily pick out any instrument by simple concentration. All I know is the noise issue with me is something with vocal processing of over-talking voices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;stickiness: for me, its dirt on my hands. Or chicken/turkey/beef/pork/lamb/goat blood. I do a lot of cooking. I hate those feelings on my skin. But I find that as long as I wash my hands before and after with a good degreasing soap (Dawn), the icky goes away. I can still do the task at speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dont have the physical contact issues for people I'm close with. So, thats not an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food: theres only a few foods I can't eat, due to vomiting reasons. Tapioca based products are the big one. Aside from that, I eat everything from blue cheese, to cow tongue, offal from beef and birds,ghost peppers, pork brains, hakarl. I like the tastes and sensations that foods have. In a way, I'm wondering if this is also relayed to the supersensitive reject-foods type. Definitely not a disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course, theres the huge downsides with interpersonal interactions. Took me decades to really piece together and emulate  and identify emotional state in others. But the psychologists dont know how to fix this either. Most of them are NTs who it comes naturally. But they want their indefinite sessions to do basically nothing but pay $200/hr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Seeing it purely as a positive is insultingly reductive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there are up and downsides to NT's and ND's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurotypicals are more known for deception and lying. Or they use the term "little white lies". These things slowly stack up in NT conversations until they become huge problems. Sitcoms are based on this. But ND's, well, we are the weird ones. When someone asks "do I look good in this?" And you say "no, it clashes with your skin tone" - you were supposed to know they wanted a yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel sad that NTs can't properly hyperfocus, and can easily drop out of hyperfocus with low sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NTs memory is foggy and badly reorders things. Or they misremember and blame others for ill-perceived issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are good and bad. I'm glad I'm ND, likely Aspergers (hence autistic). Most of these problems are ones that can be solved, at least for Aspergers side of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="athing comtr" id="46150578"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table border="0"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="ind" indent="3"&gt;&lt;img src="s.gif"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" class="votelinks"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a id="up_46150578" href="vote?id=46150578&amp;amp;how=up&amp;amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46149375"&gt;&lt;p class="votearrow" title="upvote"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="default"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="comment"&gt;&lt;div class="commtext c00"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;In the 1990s we drugged kids (especially young boys) who weren't able to sit still with ADHD medication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This never happened. We did not overprescribe Ritalin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What actually happened, is uninformed people like you with no actual evidence spread FUD about how giving kids well understood medicine was "bad" and the direct result of that was people like me, my sister, and my brother who all had stereotypical ADHD symptoms that we inherited from our stereotypically ADHD parents were tested and &lt;i&gt;rejected&lt;/i&gt; an ADHD diagnosis by untrained school guidance counselors terrified of something that &lt;i&gt;wasn't happening&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of us spent the next 30 years utterly failing to thrive due to struggling with these symptoms, and experienced immense suffering from normal life things. We all have finally gotten real diagnosis, and some of us are getting real treatment, and we are so much better off now and able to function, and we are even able to pass those learnings back up the chain to our parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A huge part of the "ADHD Epidemic" right now is the fact that a couple million people with clear ADHD symptoms were &lt;i&gt;passed over&lt;/i&gt; by people who were supposed to be helping them due to the exact FUD you are spreading now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;This generation it's autism, and it's likely over-diagnosed just as much as ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is not overdiagnosed. Autism is not overdiagnosed. Provide any evidence &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt; to support your shit claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone with just a whiff of autism struggle gets diagnosed as autism, that's fine, and they will be explained how they might not even need significant support, and they don't really get any treatment at all. For people with gentle autism like that, it's mostly just about understanding &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; you are the way you are. "Oh, that's why I &amp;lt;X&amp;gt;". And you suddenly have a framework and vocabulary to better explain the struggles you have and the problems you experience, and a way to bond with people who have similar difficulties, and a way to think about your own brain that can help you lessen the negative impact of being different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;It comes as no surprise that psychiatry, and medicine in general, is suffering from a massive reproducibility crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is ZERO reproducibility crisis in ADHD science, and amphetamine based ADHD medications are some of the most well supported, scientifically, medicine we have &lt;i&gt;full stop&lt;/i&gt;. You can literally measure &lt;i&gt;physiological&lt;/i&gt; brain differences of people with ADHD, and if you give a kid with ADHD a stimulant medication for their life, &lt;i&gt;those measurable differences go away&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you give ADHD people stimulants, &lt;i&gt;all cause mortality decreases&lt;/i&gt;. They become statistically better drivers, which is something that ADHD people are statistically worse than average at. You lower all forms of addiction and substance abuse, because ADHD people struggle with self medicating and abusing substances as a rule. Notably, all the good Ritalin does for people who struggle with ADHD is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; duplicated in people who do not have ADHD. People who take unprescribed Ritalin as a "study drug" have worse outcomes than people who take it for actual ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giving kids with ADHD stimulants &lt;i&gt;reduces bone fractures and STDs!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;You either have some quantity of illness or you don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is stupid. Some people with bad eyesight need glasses to do normal day to day things while others don't, or only need glasses for reading, but &lt;i&gt;both are diagnosed nearsighted&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;Much to the disservice of people suffering from the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stop talking for me, you are doing an atrocious job of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;It's not anti-science to call into question the amount of bunk, p-hacked, corporate funded garbage coming out of even the highest tier of medical grade journals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;i&gt;entirely&lt;/i&gt; antiscience to demonstrably have no clue what you are talking about and yet claim the experts are wrong. That is literally antiscience. There's no p-hacking in ADHD science. There's no corporate funded garbage for ADHD. Ritalin is old and cheap and no longer patent protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;If anything, your own post demonstrates the anti-scientific (pop-sci) instagramification of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How dare you thumb your nose at kids self diagnosing on tiktok (not instagram, pay attention) as "pop-sci" when you yourself know only reactionary FUD. Shame on you. Educate yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="athing comtr" id="46151202"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table border="0"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="ind" indent="3"&gt;&lt;img src="s.gif"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" class="votelinks"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a id="up_46151202" href="vote?id=46151202&amp;amp;how=up&amp;amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46149375"&gt;&lt;p class="votearrow" title="upvote"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="default"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania heart specialists welcomed the results of a decade-long study reinforcing their belief in minimally invasive techniques to treat clogged neck arteries versus major surgery.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined nearly 2,500 patients across five countries and 155 medical centers, including several UPMC hospitals and the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients hadn’t experienced a stroke but were at risk of one because of severe blockages of a carotid artery, large vessels on each side of the neck shuttling blood from the heart to the brain.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 400,000 people are diagnosed with carotid artery disease each year in the U.S., and the condition causes 1 in 3 strokes, according to data cited by Allegheny Health Network.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half the patients got either medical therapy — a combination of drugs and lifestyle management — or medical therapy plus a plaque removal surgery known as an endarterectomy. The procedure appeared to do little to lower the risk of stroke or death over a four-year period compared to medical therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other half received medical therapy and a stent, a small device to prop open the artery, or just medical therapy. The stented patients were half as likely to have a stroke or die over the four years versus those just taking the drugs.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, eagerly awaited by cardiologists and vascular surgeons worldwide, were published last month in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2508800" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Main takeaways varied among local medical professionals, who say they remain confident in their current practices.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Dr. Amish Mehta, a cardiologist at AHN’s Jefferson Hospital, the study confirmed his sense that modern medications do a great job preventing strokes.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are able to reduce clotting, lower blood pressure and limit cholesterol levels using various drugs. Most of these weren’t available in the 1990s, when researchers last compared medical therapy and surgery in such a rigorous way.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management of diet and exercise as well as smoking cessation techniques have also improved over the years, Mehta noted, further bolstering the medical therapy route.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stent still performed better in the trial, resulting in a stroke or death rate just under 3% versus 6% with medication and lifestyle changes. But the gap “doesn’t translate into a major difference in how patients do,” Mehta said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thomas Simone, a vascular surgeon at St. Clair Hospital, agreed, adding that patient preferences should be considered alongside the data.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some patients might be scared of surgery,” Simone said. “Other people are like, I can’t live like this. I have a bomb in my neck.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;Measuring stroke rates&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. William Bachinsky, a UPMC interventional cardiologist based in Central Pennsylvania, said it’s hard to ignore the case for stenting in asymptomatic but severe carotid artery disease cases.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedure, which uses a small incision in the groin to thread the stent into the carotid artery, does carry some risks up front. In the study, the stent group saw seven strokes and one death in the 44 days post-operation. All medical therapy patients, in contrast, were fine.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But stroke rates were much higher in the latter group after that. The cumulative benefits over the four-year period are worth it for many people, in the view of Bachinsky.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s performed the procedure as part of clinical trials more than 1,500 times since 2000, and was the principal investigator for the stenting trial at UPMC’s Harrisburg and West Shore hospitals.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we’ve seen time and time again is that if patients are selected properly, they’re done by experienced operators…. carotid artery stenting has similar if not better outcomes than an endarterectomy, mainly because it’s less invasive,” he said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endarterectomies involve an incision into the carotid artery, which allows the surgeon to pull out the plaque. The procedure is typically done under general anesthesia. Most people go home within a day or two.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s results have no bearing on the surgery’s efficacy in treating patients who’ve had a stroke.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hybrid procedure where surgeons place a stent using a more direct route emerged over the course of the study and therefore was not included.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This newer operation has promise in terms of reducing stroke or death during or shortly after surgery, according to Dr. Elizabeth Detschelt, a vascular surgeon at Independence Health System.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carotid artery disease is brought on by the accumulation of plaque, a sticky mix of fat, cholesterol, calcium and other substances that stiffen arterial walls and eventually limits blood flow, according to Cleveland Clinic.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t know they have a serious buildup of plaque until they have a heart attack, stroke or major issue with their cardiovascular system, Cleveland Clinic notes.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, doctors may be able to detect it using a stethoscope by listening for a bruit, a distinctive swooshing sound caused by narrowing of the carotid artery. Mehta said the disease is also sometimes caught during unrelated head and neck imaging.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk factors include age, high cholesterol and triglyceride levels, use of tobacco products, high blood pressure, diabetes, lack of exercise, poor diet and a family history of early heart disease.

&lt;/p&gt;

With crops failing and fears of starvation rising, some wealthy Italian city-states like Florence and Venice imported grain from elsewhere in the world. And on those ships most likely came plague-infected fleas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c11bf5" class="body-graf"&gt;The actions of Florence’s leaders prevented mass starvation —  tens of thousands of famine refugees migrated there, and the city was able to feed them in addition to its own citizens. But the imports unwittingly ushered in a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-85646a" class="body-graf"&gt;City leaders were proud of their accomplishment in providing enough food for so many people, said Martin Bauch, an author of the new study and a medieval historian at the Leibniz Institute for the History and Culture of Eastern Europe in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b10234" class="body-graf"&gt;“They couldn’t have an idea of what danger was there,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe451a" class="body-graf"&gt;The research offers a historical example of the way that changes in the climate can alter human societies and animal ecosystems in hard-to-predict ways and with incredible downstream consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c6d657" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers have debated and chased details of the plague’s origin and spread for decades, but this study is the first to outline in detail the potential role of a volcanic eruption. Previous research has suggested climate shifts could be responsible for introductions of the plague at various points in history, but most studies were vague about it, according to Henry Fell, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Nottingham and the University of York in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4e8470" class="body-graf"&gt;“This paper, I think, is really good for being quite specific on the mechanism that’s driving it,” said Fell, who was not involved in the study but has studied the Black Death and climate change. “We can see grain trade increasing from these ports, and the cause of it is climate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="body-hori-rule"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74ac69" class="body-graf"&gt;Volcanic eruptions can cool the planet by injecting forms of sulfur into the stratosphere, which reduces the amount of sunshine that can reach Earth’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-00d3da" class="body-graf"&gt;“It literally blocks out some of the sun that leads to cooling,” Fell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ddba39" class="body-graf"&gt;The effect can last several years after significant eruptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fd5f6c" class="body-graf"&gt;To understand 14th century volcanic activity for the new study, researchers reviewed tree ring records, data from ice cores and written historical observations. All three lines of evidence agreed: A cooling period and a Mediterranean famine from 1345 to 1347 preceded and coincided with the plague’s emergence in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-896109" class="body-graf"&gt;The team studied the chemical composition of ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica, since layers of ice in polar regions can trap chemicals from when snow originally fell, offering a kind of timeline. They found that the year 1345 had the 18th-strongest signal for sulfur in the last 2,000 years. The amount of material injected into the stratosphere that year exceeded the best recent example of that dynamic, the&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna43415342" target="_blank"&gt; Mount Pinatubo injection of 1991&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-238ab0" class="body-graf"&gt;Meanwhile, tree rings dating to the same period have biological stains called “blue rings” that indicate stress and a likely cold spell. The blue rings appear consecutively, an extreme rarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-815192" class="body-graf"&gt;Finally, written accounts from the time in present-day China, Japan, Germany, France and Italy report less sunshine and an increase in cloudiness, the study says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d44498" class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers could not pinpoint which particular volcano or volcanoes erupted in 1345. But they did determine the region of the world: “​This must be a tropical eruption,” Bauch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-59c00d" class="body-graf"&gt;The reason: Ice cores from both of Earth’s poles had roughly equal measures of volcanic sulfate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="body-hori-rule"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-619d11" class="body-graf"&gt;Historical records show reports of crop failures and high prices for wheat during that cool period, with severe famine in large parts of Spain, southern France, Italy, Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean, according to the new study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-34821e" class="body-graf"&gt;At the time, Italian city-states were wealthy, Bauch said, and had developed storage systems for grain and huge trade networks established over centuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25c181" class="body-graf"&gt;But as famine deepened, their options dwindled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5f4c0" class="body-graf"&gt;“They really start to realize in 1347, ‘We have to import from the Black Sea. That’s the last place where they still have enough grain for our needs,’” Bauch said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0cf7b6" class="body-graf"&gt;“Of course, they’re not aware of how the plague gets to them,” he added. “I have records from Venice in 1349, and they’re really satisfied, and they say, ‘Look, in the last famine, the Black Sea grain really saved us, and that worked very well.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e953d" class="body-graf"&gt;Bauch said he suspects that the plague most likely would have reached Europe eventually but that the events initiated by the volcanic eruptions were likely to have accelerated the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06e312" class="body-graf"&gt;As much as 60% of the population died in parts of Europe from 1347 to 1353, making it one of the deadliest periods in history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-83b557" class="body-graf"&gt;Past research on the plague’s origins has relied on written accounts, archaeological evidence and even genetic clues. In 2022, scientists found DNA evidence of the bacterium that causes the plague &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/ancient-teeth-offer-new-insight-black-death-emerged-spread-globally-rcna33329" target="_blank"&gt;in bodies buried in modern-day Kyrgyzstan&lt;/a&gt; — far east of Europe. Grave markers indicate that many of those killed were buried in 1338 and 1339 (about a decade before the plague hit Europe) and that they died of “pestilence.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-7738fa"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1667" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251203-Yersinia-pestis-bubonic-plauge-gk-a09268.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251203-Yersinia-pestis-bubonic-plauge-gk-a09268.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251203-Yersinia-pestis-bubonic-plauge-gk-a09268.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251203-Yersinia-pestis-bubonic-plauge-gk-a09268.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251203-Yersinia-pestis-bubonic-plauge-gk-a09268.jpg" alt="Yersinia Pestis"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Yersinia pestis bacteria, which cause bubonic plague in animals and humans, are usually transmitted by the bites of infected rat fleas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;BSIP / Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f783bb" class="body-graf"&gt;The same research group also discovered that marmots living today in the Tian Shan mountain range near the burial site carry a closely related strain of the bacterium, which is a clue that the Black Death could have emerged in that location before it spread elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-673f5e" class="body-graf"&gt;The new study could explain what happened next, Fell said, adding that he thought the authors made a convincing argument that a volcano was to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84938c" class="body-graf"&gt;After the plague first exploded in Europe, it re-emerged for centuries, reshaping human history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2131c7" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“In a European context, it’s so important to our history,” Fell said. “Any study where you’re looking at a long time period across Europe, there’ll be a plague.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPaFI1c0hLb1FHb3FEVG9tR3RseXlYU2RjNjJvNExQZWMxbFI4dlFNRWpjUGxFLWFTMElCWjNpQlo5b0ZndnQzOVRiV3gxQXR1NmIyc21Td1JvU2VWRDAzVm1SUzlBNG1Ua1VRVWhhZTUyMVpnVjl3WjJNMnh6QzAyQWduYlFNWnduV2NDRllfQzF3aDVFN2xVVNIBVkFVX3lxTE1jLWVENFZQMDdjWk5kcVNrSlltbF9CbV9NMzlfQnVTT01PRXJudjVUbDZweTZHdUZSeDhVZ3lFV2FaTGpxdEM3dXJWNURTQXMtaDVvT0lB</guid></item><item><title>研究人员发现，火山爆发引发了导致黑死病的“蝴蝶效应” - Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/volcanic-eruption-triggered-butterfly-effect-that-led-to-the-black-death-researchers-find</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto paywall-locker"&gt;
&lt;p id="fe9fce6d-19df-4ea4-bc29-2f8058cdc384"&gt;An unknown volcanic eruption in the mid-14th century may have set the stage for the spread of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-was-the-black-death.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-was-the-black-death.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Black Death&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Europe, according to a new study. By triggering a cool and overcast period in the Mediterranean, the eruption started a domino effect that led to a downturn in agricultural production, which required merchants to import grain — and the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/em&gt; that causes bubonic plague — via the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bubonic plague &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/pandemic" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/pandemic"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, more commonly known as the Black Death, reached Europe in 1347 and quickly affected Italian port cities. The plague then spread throughout Europe over the next few years, resulting in the deaths of between 30% and 60% of the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="fe9fce6d-19df-4ea4-bc29-2f8058cdc384-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.leibniz-gwzo.de/en/institute/team-z/martin-bauch" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.leibniz-gwzo.de/en/institute/team-z/martin-bauch" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Martin Bauch&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a historian at the Leibniz Institute for the History and Culture of Eastern Europe in Germany, told Live Science in an email that one very specific aspect of the plague pandemic intrigued him: "How and why did the Black Death reach Italy from the Black Sea at precisely this moment?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ee70e07d-814c-4dc5-8b91-dab788d5ba4e"&gt;To answer this question, Bauch and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/people/buentgen/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/people/buentgen/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ulf Büntgen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a geographer at the University of Cambridge, investigated climate-driven changes in the Mediterranean that could explain the sudden appearance of the Black Death in 1347. Their research was published Thursday (Dec. 4) in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_6075740241125072610&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43247-025-02964-0&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fplanet-earth%2Fvolcanic-eruption-triggered-butterfly-effect-that-led-to-the-black-death-researchers-find" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02964-0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43247-025-02964-0&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fplanet-earth%2Fvolcanic-eruption-triggered-butterfly-effect-that-led-to-the-black-death-researchers-find" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Communications Earth &amp;amp; Environment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combing through contemporaneous historical accounts, the researchers noticed reports of reduced sunshine, increased cloudiness and a dark &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-a-lunar-eclipse" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-a-lunar-eclipse"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lunar eclipse&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all independently reported by observers in parts of Asia and Europe between 1345 and 1349. All of these astronomical and weather phenomena could be attributed to a large-scale volcanic aerosol layer, which has been known to cause cold spells as the sulfate aerosols &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/climate-change/did-the-tonga-eruption-cause-this-years-extreme-heat" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/climate-change/did-the-tonga-eruption-cause-this-years-extreme-heat"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reflect sunlight back into space&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paleoclimate data gave the researchers a clue: High amounts of sulfur in polar ice cores suggested one or more eruptions of a previously unknown volcano around 1345.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We cannot say very much about the volcanic eruption," Bauch said. "From the ice cores, we know that the eruption must have taken place in the tropics, because sulfate was found in similar concentrations in the ice of both the North and South Poles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ShiS3yaKkF8C8esueN37Li" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ShiS3yaKkF8C8esueN37Li slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at tree-ring data from around Europe and discovered that the summers of 1345, 1346 and 1347 were much colder than normal while the autumns were much wetter, causing soil erosion and flooding. Historical records also confirmed that changes in the environment had decreased the yield of a number of crops, including the grape harvest and grain production in Italy, requiring merchants to begin importing products from the Black Sea area to prevent famine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Upon return in the second half of 1347 CE, the Italian trade fleets, however, not only brought grain back to the Mediterranean harbours, but also carried the plague bacterium &lt;em&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/em&gt; most likely via fleas that were feeding on grain dust during their long journey," the researchers wrote in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first cases of plague in humans were reported in Venice just a few weeks after the arrival of the last grain ships. "This initiates the typical infection cycle," Bauch said. "Rodent populations are infected first; once they die off, the fleas shift to other mammals and ultimately to humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importing grain after several years' worth of volcano-induced climate change therefore prevented a Mediterranean-wide famine but also introduced the Black Death into Europe, the study authors proposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="8e905f28-6fa2-4de2-9463-4a232ad8f84f"&gt;"This study brings in new information on the 1345 volcano, which helps explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the Black Death — that is, the epidemic well-documented in sources from 1346 to 1350 — happened when it did," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9Kh8rT0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" data-url="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9Kh8rT0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Monica H. Green&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an independent scholar and expert on the Black Death who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. "But it happened &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it did — with a 'plague infrastructure' of rodents and insect vectors already established — because &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/medical-history/article/plague-history-mongol-history-and-the-processes-of-focalisation-leading-up-to-the-black-death-a-response-to-brack-et-al/F38569656E9104D86612103560AE66EF" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/medical-history/article/plague-history-mongol-history-and-the-processes-of-focalisation-leading-up-to-the-black-death-a-response-to-brack-et-al/F38569656E9104D86612103560AE66EF" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;local reservoirs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had already been established."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The onset of the Black Death resulted from a unique-but-random combination of short-term factors, like climate, and long-term factors, like the grain distribution system in Italy, the researchers wrote in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the Black Death resulted from a rare confluence of environmental and social factors, it's important to gain a better understanding of the causes of past pandemics, the researchers wrote, because "the probability of zoonotic infectious diseases to emerge and translate into pandemics is likely to increase in both a globalised and warmer world."&lt;/p&gt;

A new national analysis finds that soil organic carbon can break down more than tenfold faster in some samples than in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That imbalance makes these new results important for climate forecasts and for programs that pay landowners to keep carbon in the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-soil-carbon-matters"&gt;Why soil carbon matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organic matter in soil breaks down over time, sending some carbon into the air as carbon dioxide and leaving some stored underground. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Chaoqun Lu, an associate professor at &lt;a href="https://www.iastate.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Iowa State University&lt;/a&gt; who studies how land ecosystems store and release carbon. Her research focuses on the processes that shape long term soil carbon change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soils worldwide hold more carbon than the atmosphere and all vegetation together, according to an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31540-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; that combined measurements from many ecosystems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of that long lasting carbon sits as mineral-associated organic carbon, carbon that sticks to fine particles and can stay in soil for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global Earth system models, tools that track &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/global-warming-may-trigger-rapid-release-of-soil-carbon/"&gt;exchanges of carbon&lt;/a&gt;, water, and energy between land, ocean, and air, still struggle with soil carbon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One evaluation&lt;a href="https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/19/4671/2022/"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;of the latest generation of these models found large errors in how much soil carbon they predict across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study tackles one missing piece, the basic tendency of different soils to release carbon once microbes begin working on organic matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers call that tendency intrinsic decomposability, the base decay rate measured under the same temperature and moisture before outside stresses are added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-soil-carbon-systems"&gt;Studying soil carbon systems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the U.S., the team used the National Ecological Observatory Network (&lt;a href="https://www.nsf.gov/focus-areas/infrastructure/national-ecological-observatory-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NEON&lt;/a&gt;), a nationwide facility that tracks ecosystems at field sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From that system they selected 20 locations, ranging from deserts to forests, and collected 156 soil samples for intensive lab work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lab, each soil sample spent 18 months in controlled temperature and moisture. During that period, researchers tracked carbon dioxide coming off the soil and traits such as pH, nitrogen, and microbial activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those measurements fed into a mechanistic soil model that estimated two key numbers for each sample, its decay rate and its carbon use efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbon use efficiency, the share of decomposed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/rivers-carry-hidden-carbon-that-shapes-earths-climate/"&gt;carbon&lt;/a&gt; microbes kept in bodies instead of exhaled as gas, shows how carbon stays in the soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then used machine learning to test which of 26 measured soil properties best explained differences in those decay rates and efficiencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well known factors such as soil type, pH, and nitrogen remained important, but fungal abundance and certain iron and aluminum forms also stood out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-minerals-microbes-and-controls"&gt;Minerals, microbes, and controls&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have increasingly learned that interactions between organic matter and minerals often decide whether carbon stays in soil or escapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10840363/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; showed that iron and aluminum oxides form tight bonds with organic molecules, slowing their breakdown across many soil types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new analysis, soils richer in those metals and fungi showed slower decay and higher carbon use efficiency in mineral associated carbon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, soils where most carbon sat in loose particles with fewer protective minerals released a larger share as gas once microbes decomposed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists refer to that loose pool as particulate organic carbon, relatively fresh plant material and fragments that typically decompose within a few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this fraction is more exposed to microbes and less bound to minerals, it often responds faster to warming or shifts in moisture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, many modeling studies have treated soils of the same type or biome as sharing one base decay rate when conditions stay constant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-soil-behavior-across-the-u-s"&gt;Soil behavior across the U.S.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the fitted model, the team produced national maps that estimate decay rate and carbon use efficiency for both particulate and mineral-associated carbon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each mapped cell covers roughly a square 2.5 miles on a side, fine enough to capture differences between regions that share the same climate label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting maps show that soils in the Southwest break down carbon faster and send more of it into the air as carbon dioxide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Northwest and much of the East, decomposition runs slowly and more carbon becomes &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-microbes-frozen-for-40000-years-thaw-revive-reorganize-devour-carbon/"&gt;microbial&lt;/a&gt; biomass, while the Midwest shows intermediate behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern highlights stable pockets of soil carbon in parts of the Northwest and eastern United States, where mineral-associated pools are abundant and decay rates stay low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, regions with thinner protective mineral layers or disturbance may see soil carbon stocks shrink faster when climate warms or land use changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lessons-from-soil-carbon"&gt;Lessons from soil carbon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earth system simulations guide carbon budgets for countries and companies, and they also underpin many land based carbon offset projects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If those simulations underestimate how fast some soils lose carbon or overestimate persistence elsewhere, climate plans built on them can be off the mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers expect other modeling groups to start using their parameter maps as inputs to improve simulations of carbon climate feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the policy side, the regional differences in carbon retention suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-land-use-has-removed-billions-of-tons-of-carbon-sequestration/"&gt;carbon&lt;/a&gt; market rules may need to look beyond simple totals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A member of the team explained that carbon held longer in certain regions may offer greater long term benefits than identical amounts stored elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Land managers could use this mapping to decide where practices like cover crops and forest restoration will keep carbon in soil longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As similar studies extend to other continents, soils that once looked uniform in climate models start to show detailed patterns that can guide decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/one-earth/abstract/S2590-3322%2825%2900342-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;One Earth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;

Me, definitely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many family members, friends and coworkers would raise their hands right now, too, if I asked them. Since temperatures dropped across the United States, my family has gotten through some nasty colds and undiagnosed viral infections, bronchitis, and several Covid-19 tests (all negative, thank goodness).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m sure Thanksgiving holiday travel has spread all sorts of illness (not that I’m blaming the crowds who joined me at the National Gingerbread House Competition in Asheville, North Carolina). Meanwhile, the appearance of a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/health/new-flu-variant-subclade-k?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:new flu variant and lagging vaccination rates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;new flu variant and lagging vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; will probably contribute to a severe flu season, much like last year or even worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What should you and I do? I turned to CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know she can’t guarantee good health all winter, but I bet she can help to reduce the odds of getting sick, navigate the illness once it does happen (because you most likely will fall ill sometime this winter), and decide when it’s time to get medical treatment. And bless you, if you just sneezed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Several factors contribute to people having more respiratory illnesses in winter. - Carol Yepes/Moment RF/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do we really fall ill more frequently in winter, or is it just all this travel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; We do see more respiratory infections in the winter months. Data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention consistently shows that illnesses such as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:respiratory syncytial virus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;respiratory syncytial virus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season.html#:~:text=While%20influenza%20viruses%20spread%20year,varies%20from%20season%20to%20season." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:influenza;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/season-outlook25-26.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:many viruses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;many viruses&lt;/a&gt; that cause the common cold surge between late fall and early spring. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/surveillance/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Covid-19 cases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Covid-19 cases&lt;/a&gt; also have tended to rise during this period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons for this seasonal pattern. First, colder weather means people are spending more time indoors and nearer one another. Windows are closed, ventilation is reduced, and people gather at school, at work and during holidays. That all creates ideal conditions for viruses to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, dry air helps respiratory viruses survive longer in the environment. Studies have shown that some virus particles &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2023/02/23/tend-get-sick-when-air-dry-new-research-helps-explain-why#:~:text=Published%20in%20December%20in%20PNAS,around%20the%20virus%2C%20especially%20at" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:remain airborne longer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;remain airborne longer&lt;/a&gt; and stay infectious longer when humidity is low, which is common in winter months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel adds another important layer. Airports, planes, buses and family gatherings bring together large numbers of people from different places. If viruses are circulating, travel and holidays can accelerate transmission, especially when people go from event to event without knowing that they are contagious. So yes, travel affects spread, but it is working on top of winter conditions that already favor viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: How do I reduce my chances of getting sick?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; There is no guaranteed way to avoid illness entirely, but some steps can lower your risk. Vaccination is one of the most effective tools to reduce severe illness. Getting the flu vaccine, the updated Covid vaccine and the RSV vaccine for eligible individuals &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/15/health/flu-covid-season-vaccine-tips-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:helps to reduce;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;helps to reduce&lt;/a&gt; the risk of hospitalization and severe complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hand hygiene is also key. It’s good practice to wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using shared public spaces, after coughing or sneezing, and before eating. Handwashing helps prevent the transfer of viruses from surfaces to your mouth, nose or eyes. When soap and water are not available, alcohol-based sanitizer is a reasonable backup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are in crowded spaces, especially indoors or around people who are coughing or sneezing, a well-fitting &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/15/health/mask-guide-faq-n95-kn95-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:N95 or equivalent mask;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;N95 or equivalent mask&lt;/a&gt; can add a layer of protection. This step is especially important for people at higher risk, including those over 65, people with chronic illnesses such as diabetes or lung disease, or those with a weakened immune system. If you’re sick, masking can help reduce the odds that your loved ones will get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ventilation can help, too. Opening windows when possible, improving airflow with fans or using a portable HEPA, or high-efficiency particulate air, filter can dilute airborne viruses. These strategies are especially useful when hosting gatherings inside. If weather permits, outdoor gatherings also substantially reduce infection risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you are sick, stay home. Reschedule that holiday meal or exchange gifts another day. One of the most important ways to reduce spread is for people to avoid exposing others while contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What do I do if I am sick? Should I get tested?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Most respiratory infections can be safely managed at home. Rest and drink plenty of fluids, especially if you have fever or congestion, because dehydration can worsen symptoms like headache and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing can be helpful in certain cases. People eligible &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/hcp/antivirals/summary-clinicians.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to receive antiviral medications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;to receive antiviral medications&lt;/a&gt; if they have Covid-19 or influenza should test as soon as they have symptoms since it can be helpful to know what’s making you sick in case you need to get treatment. Flu and Covid tests, individually and &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fedition.cnn.com%2F2023%2F02%2F24%2Fhealth%2Ffda-flu-covid-test&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7Ce47b5a6dc6294adb9c1208de3209290d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C639003212108755276%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=SpuKGAVVCAwoF20yr%2FVFS3d%2B0UvI2Td14%2BLRup9jk0k%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in combination;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;in combination&lt;/a&gt;, are widely available over the counter and should be used by those who are medically vulnerable or living with those who are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What if I have a fever?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can reduce fever and provide relief for symptoms such as headache and fatigue. Here again, hydration is essential. Fever causes the body to lose more fluid than usual, which can lead to dehydration. Drink plenty of water, broth or electrolyte drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For babies younger than 3 months, fever should be evaluated by a clinician. You should call the pediatrician right away if a young baby develops a fever greater than &lt;a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions/fever#:~:text=Call%20your%20child's%20physician%20immediately,child%20is%20difficult%20to%20awaken." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:100.4 degrees Fahrenheit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;100.4 degrees Fahrenheit&lt;/a&gt;. Parents of children 3 months or older and up to 2 years old should call the child’s physician if they have a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit or greater, or if they have had a fever for more than 24 hours without an obvious cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What about for older kids and adults? When should they head to the doctor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Seek medical care if symptoms last more than a week without improvement. Also, if you start getting better and then suddenly worsen again, it could be a sign that you have a secondary infection, such as a bacterial infection, that needs to be treated. People with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease or weakened immune systems should reach out sooner because they are more prone to complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other reasons to contact a health care clinician include trouble catching your breath, persistent wheezing, severe headaches, one-sided ear pain, sinus pain lasting more than a few days or dehydration. And if you are eligible for antiviral treatment, you should also reach out to your doctor as antiviral medications are most effective if prescribed early in the course of illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: When should I go to the emergency room?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Emergency care is necessary when symptoms suggest a serious complication or when breathing is affected. Warning signs include difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, severe dehydration, inability to stay awake, bluish discoloration of the lips or face, or symptoms that rapidly worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For infants, additional red flags include difficulty feeding, fewer wet diapers, fast or labored breathing or unusual sleepiness. If you are unsure but concerned about someone’s breathing or alertness, it is best to seek emergency care right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:25:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPUHVqLXFUaWZQdGVBSkN4R2hPNnVnZUtoenkwMkNYMU5RZE9wek40akR0RUd5eDNOV0NoeUU0S2lraE83QmkxZEJaVThRZFFKeFc2UlZkWDV1bENFTmtYMC1VdXc2ZEF4VzRpS2J1YUFhVEdYbXpSTHdJRlFGeUJ3RGtjcDhTRlU</guid></item><item><title>美国癌症协会建议宫颈癌筛查采用自我拭子HPV检测- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/american-cancer-society-recommends-self-swab-hpv-test-cervical-cancer-rcna247244</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c8e5fc" class="body-graf"&gt;Cervical cancer screening can now include “self-swab” HPV tests, according to &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.70041" target="_blank"&gt;updated guidelines&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday by the American Cancer Society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-35a923" class="body-graf"&gt;The change, experts hope, will encourage more women to undergo regular screening for the cancer by giving them an alternative to a speculum exam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8e6521" class="body-graf"&gt;Testing for HPV, or human papillomavirus, has supplanted the Pap test as the preferred method for cervical cancer screening. Pap tests (also called cytology) involve collecting cells from a patient’s cervix during a pelvic exam, a process some women find uncomfortable and even painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-85a24a" class="body-graf"&gt; “HPV is such a strong indicator of cervical cancer, we know now that screening for HPV is screening for cervical cancer. This gives more options to women,” said Jane Montealegre, an associate professor of behavioral science at the The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who was not involved in the updated guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cf3a0d" class="body-graf"&gt;HPV testing has typically used a similar approach to a Pap test, using cells collected from the cervix. Since 2024, however, the Food and Drug Administration has approved three self-administered HPV tests, including &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/fda-approves-home-hpv-test-screen-cervical-cancer-rcna205713" target="_blank"&gt;one that can be done at home&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c14d2" class="body-graf"&gt;Cervical cancer rates have been steadily falling in the United States &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/cervical-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;since the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;, largely because of improved screening and widespread use of the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hpv-vaccine-safe-cuts-cancer-risk-large-studies-rfk-jr-rcna245437" target="_blank"&gt;HPV vaccine&lt;/a&gt; since its approval in 2006. There are 40 different types of HPV that can infect the genitals, 13 of which &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/basic-information.html" target="_blank"&gt;cause nearly all cervical cancers&lt;/a&gt;. HPV testing focuses on the high-risk strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-494030" class="body-graf"&gt;Despite falling rates of cervical cancer, more than 20% of American women aren’t up to date on screening, a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2788175" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt; study found. The self-administered tests allow patients to collect their own sample using a vaginal swab in a doctor’s office. One of the FDA-approved tests allows women to use the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/fda-approves-home-hpv-test-screen-cervical-cancer-rcna205713" target="_blank"&gt;swab at home&lt;/a&gt; and mail it to a lab for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ba1dc0" class="body-graf"&gt;The self-administered tests allow patients to collect their own sample using a vaginal swab in a doctor’s office. One of the FDA-approved tests allows women to use the swab at home and mail it to a lab for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-07ca1a" class="body-graf"&gt;“A woman would be given a kit and could go some place, either the exam room or bathroom, and collect her own sample,” said Robert Smith, a cancer epidemiologist and senior vice president of early cancer detection science for the American Cancer Society. Smith was the senior author of the update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dbf225" class="body-graf"&gt;Both the American Cancer Society and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force — a group of independent doctors, nurses and public health experts who regularly review the latest scientific research and issue recommendations for everything from diabetes to cancer screening — &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/cervical-cancer-screening" target="_blank"&gt;recommend women screen for cervical cancer using HPV testing every 5 years&lt;/a&gt;. If the test is positive, a doctor will follow up with additional testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-509d69" class="body-graf"&gt;Both groups also say patients can be screened using a Pap test  and a speculum exam every 3 years, or through using both methods every 5 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-790be7" class="body-graf"&gt;Where the two groups differ is when screening should begin: The American Cancer Society  recommends women start this screening regimen at age 25, and not screen before that. The task force, whose  recommendations influence what screenings insurance will cover, &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/cervical-cancer-screening#fullrecommendationstart" target="_blank"&gt;recommends starting the HPV screening schedule at age 30&lt;/a&gt;, and screening with cytology alone every 3 years between ages 21 and 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0cd9a7" class="body-graf"&gt;Montealegre said she does not expect the task force to change its stance on this, however, it is expected to update its guidelines for HPV screening to include self-administered tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7eb07e" class="body-graf"&gt;Cervical cancer screening is covered under the Affordable Care Act, and Montealegre said the self-administered tests, at least those administered at a health clinic, will likely be covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ae4360" class="body-graf"&gt;“Primary HPV testing is already recommended by the USPSTF, so it is already covered by insurance, and they don’t specify how it has to be collected,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-95f411" class="body-graf"&gt;Both organizations recommending the HPV test as the primary way to screen for cervical cancer “indicates that there is growing agreement that it is the gold standard,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b965d8" class="body-graf"&gt;“We have known for years that primary HPV testing is much more efficient, now we are doing self-sampling to allow for better access,” said Dr. Diane Harper, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and family medicine at the University of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-285b21" class="body-graf"&gt;The American Cancer Society update also included clarification on when a woman can stop cervical cancer screening. Previously, both the group and the task force recommended screening up to age 65. The updated guidelines clarify that this should be the case only if a woman has had consistent screening, with negative results, for at least a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-01b19c" class="body-graf"&gt;“Despite clear recommendations on the importance of women being up to date with screening up to 65, very few women are,” Smith said. “It’s important for women to understand that there is a record they will want to have by the time they are 65 that will basically tell them it’s safe to stop screening for cervical cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f33994" class="body-graf"&gt;Harper, who wasn’t involved in drafting the new guidelines, expects that in the coming years, cervical cancer screening will likely be done at even longer intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d93e84" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We have data showing now that in a highly vaccinated population, you can screen every 10 years, but we in the U.S. are lagging behind,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxQRWdhTlk0LXhLLVZnQV9PbGoyV2VUZm9aam42NDFqRElGam1ndnpDa0I0VFA4X253WHdLNlVkaWRrVy1qckU5cG1XZkdSc1lqN2NYMlJKeEIwdUR1a1AyWUNtZ1FSVE5xdGxhZFlrSF9MZnhQT2NxeTJiRXNxM2puaGNZSHp0amE3eWVXRkp5dUhFN1BLYmRkSlZVOWpTUEg2bEZUSGp4RGVfZ1phejRvSUtqYmotZlNfd3RNSF9Va2ZhTjTSAVZBVV95cUxOa2FFQ1VGcWRZNjRrWm1DeWl0enU2VXlEZHZOUnJsS2VSUm1vOFhQOHZ2NVd1bk1MTDEwUlJoaGxWYmtobVhKYXpoVGkwQmxlUHItVjc0QQ</guid></item><item><title>安全有效铲雪的完整指南：针对每种降雪的技术- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/complete-guide-safe-effective-snow-140506127.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's nothing quite like watching snow begin to fall, especially during the beginning of the winter season. Perhaps you pour yourself a hot chocolate and sit by the window, admiring the silent landscape the snow slowly transforms. At some point, however, the other shoe drops, and you remember that winter's beauty comes with a price ... the inevitable task of snow removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all snow is created equal, and your shoveling strategy should adapt accordingly. Understanding the difference between wet and dry snow, and adjusting your technique to suit the job ahead of you can save your back, protect your health and make the task far more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, however, here's a word of advice from weather.com senior digital meteorologist Jonathan Erdman, who lives in Wisconsin and is no stranger to dealing with snow. After shoveling out from &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/post-thanksgiving-winter-storm-smashed-171500688.html" rel data-ylk="slk:Winter Storm Bellamy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;Winter Storm Bellamy&lt;/a&gt; last weekend, Erdman writes: "I did (re)learn one thing with Bellamy: Eventually, even shoveling 10 inches of fluffy, dry snow becomes too heavy for most. I used a snowthrower for most of it, but the area where my snowthrower wouldn't go (back patio) was quite a slog."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, remember your limits, and keep in mind that big snowfall totals may require a different approach than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Olga Pankova/ Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying Wet vs. Dry Snow: Know What You're Working With&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you even grab your shovel, take a moment to assess the snow you're facing. The type of snow will dictate your entire approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry Snow Characteristics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light and powdery texture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easy to blow around with wind&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temperature typically below 20°F when it fell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sparkles in sunlight and doesn't stick together easily&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makes a crunching sound underfoot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wet Snow Characteristics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy and dense texture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sticks together when compressed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temperature close to or above freezing when it fell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appears more translucent and doesn't sparkle as much&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packs easily into snowballs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple test: Pick up a handful of snow. If it crumbles and falls apart, it's dry. If it holds together or feels heavy in your hand, you're dealing with wet snow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tackling Dry Snow: Pushing Is Key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Christopher Kimmel/ Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry snow is your friend when it comes to efficient removal. Its light weight means you can move larger volumes with less strain on your body. As weather.com senior digital meteorologist Jonathan Belles puts it, "With less moisture, this fluff lifts very easily. Still, don't let 2 feet pile up, but this snow can wait a little while."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Techniques For Dry Snow:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push, Don't Lift:&lt;/strong&gt; Use a wide pusher shovel and simply push the snow to the sides of your driveway or walkway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work In Strips: &lt;/strong&gt;Clear your driveway in parallel strips, pushing snow consistently to one side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time It Right: &lt;/strong&gt;Clear dry snow soon after it falls—the longer it sits, the more likely it is to compact or develop an icy layer underneath..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment Choice:&lt;/strong&gt; A wide, curved pusher shovel or snow pusher is ideal for dry snow. The larger surface area lets you move more snow with each pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoveling Wet Snow: Strategy Over Strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;mladenbalinovac/ Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wet snow demands respect. A single shovelful can weigh 15-20 pounds or more, making technique crucial for preventing injury. Meteorologist Belles warns, "Shoveling heavy, wet snow isn't just back-breaking — it can be deadly. Not-so-affectionately known as &lt;a href="https://weather.com/safety/winter/news/2024-01-12-shoveling-snow-heart-attack-stress" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart attack snow;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart attack snow&lt;/a&gt;, the density and weight of this snow can cause your heart, muscles and respiratory systems to go into overdrive when shoveling a lot of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Techniques For Wet Snow:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smaller Bites:&lt;/strong&gt; Take smaller amounts with each scoop — your back will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lift With Your Legs:&lt;/strong&gt; Bend at the knees, not the waist, and use your leg muscles to power the lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Close:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep the shovel close to your body to minimize back strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divide And Conquer:&lt;/strong&gt; Break large accumulations into manageable sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment Choice: &lt;/strong&gt;A smaller, straight-handled shovel gives you better control with heavy, wet snow. Consider a shovel with a curved handle to reduce bending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastering Driveway Clearing: A Strategic Approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Nejc Gostincar/ Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your driveway is likely the largest area you'll need to clear, making strategy essential for efficiency and safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Optimal Driveway Technique:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Early And Often:&lt;/strong&gt; Begin clearing when 2-3 inches have accumulated, rather than waiting for the storm to end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear The Apron First:&lt;/strong&gt; Always start by clearing the area where your driveway meets the street — this prevents you from getting blocked in. However, as Erdman warns, "Before you clear the apron of your driveway, check to make sure the snowplow isn’t about to go down your street, or wait until after it clears your area, or you'll have to do it twice, or more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work From The Middle Out:&lt;/strong&gt; Start at the center of your driveway and push snow toward both edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create Strategic Piles:&lt;/strong&gt; Designate specific areas for snow storage that won't block sight lines or create drainage problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; If you're expecting a heavy snowfall, apply ice melt or rock salt before the storm begins. This creates a barrier that makes removal much easier later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety First: Protecting Your Health While Shoveling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snow shoveling can be hard on your health. In fact, according to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/the-big-number-snow-shoveling-results-in-about-11500-injuries--including-100-fatalities/2019/12/06/10c46858-178a-11ea-8406-df3c54b3253e_story.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; compiled by the Consumer Product Safety Division, shoveling the white stuff sends more than 11,000 people to emergency rooms each year. Here's how to avoid becoming a part of this number:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before You Begin:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warm up with 5-10 minutes of light stretching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dress in layers to avoid overheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay hydrated, as cold air can mask dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider your health conditions. Those with heart problems should consult their doctor first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While Shoveling:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take breaks every 15-20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen to your body. Chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness means stop immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintain good posture: keep your back straight and lift with your legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid throwing snow over your shoulder, as this twisting motion is a common cause of injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technique Reminders:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep the shovel blade close to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn your whole body rather than twisting your spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you must lift, do it slowly and smoothly, using no jerky movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider using a spray lubricant or &lt;a href="https://weather.com/safety/winter/video/winter-weather-life-hacks-safety-preparation-season-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cooking spray;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cooking spray &lt;/a&gt;on your shovel blade to prevent sticking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to Call for Help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the best shoveling strategy is knowing when not to shovel. Consider professional help or assistance if:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have heart conditions, back problems, or other health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The snowfall exceeds 6 inches of wet snow or 12 inches of dry snow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ice has formed under the snow, creating hazardous conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're feeling overwhelmed or exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Erdman notes, "Don’t be afraid to hire some help, whether a snow-removal service or someone in the community. If this task is becoming too much for you, it’s money well spent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective snow removal is about working smarter, not harder. By identifying your snow type, choosing the right technique, and prioritizing safety, you can turn this winter chore from a dreaded task into a manageable part of your seasonal routine. Remember: No driveway is worth a trip to the emergency room. When in doubt, take your time, take breaks and don't hesitate to ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay safe, stay warm, and remember ... spring will come eventually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are your go-to snow shoveling tips and techniques?

&lt;p&gt;Staff with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are in Maine this week to assist local health officials in responding to what they say is an unprecedented HIV outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/news/health/us-cdc-staff-assisting-penobscot-county-unprecedented-hiv-outbreak/97-9d4cef04-76fa-47c8-bdb0-b3e4ee1e5aca"&gt;According to News Center Maine&lt;/a&gt;, 30 people in Maine's Penobscot County have been diagnosed with HIV in the last two years alone. Local health officials say most of the cases are linked to homelessness and drug use involving needles.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“A population that’s very vulnerable and marginalized, so all those things are coming together to really create a situation for this outbreak to exist,” said Jennifer Gunderman, director of Bangor Public Health and Community Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CDC spokesperson confirmed that six federal staff members are working with local health officials until Dec. 19 to better understand how the virus is spreading. The team is also conducting interviews with affected residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa Sockabasin, co-CEO of Wabanaki Public Health and Wellness, says the need for support has surged as the outbreak grows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing people come through our doors at rates that we never had seen before, people who need services and that connection to further care,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local health officials say findings from the CDC could shape Maine’s HIV response for years to come and help better protect some of the state’s most vulnerable residents.&lt;/p&gt;

At this week’s meeting, the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01852-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01852-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt; (ACIP) is expected to discuss aluminium, an adjuvant widely used in inoculations against diphtheria, tetanus and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02914-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02914-y" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;hepatitis B&lt;/a&gt;, among others. Over the past century, hundreds of millions of people have received vaccines containing small amounts of aluminium as an adjuvant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But researchers are also racing to develop new adjuvants that can stimulate the immune responses needed to combat specific pathogens. Such adjuvants could prove crucial to the success of the next generation of vaccines against diseases including &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02171-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02171-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03115-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03115-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;, and against viruses such as HIV, says Darrell Irvine, a vaccine immunologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are huge global health issues,” he says. “And adjuvants are likely going to be part of the solution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccines’ little helpers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjuvants can work in different ways. Some adjuvants trigger low levels of inflammation at the injection site, thereby boosting recruitment of immune cells to where they are needed and encouraging the cells to linger there. Others are more specific, activating molecular signalling pathways in certain classes of immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aluminium is in the first category, and its vaccine-boosting properties have been known for more than a century, says Irvine. Decades of use and scrutiny by regulators have clearly established that the benefits of using aluminium adjuvants outweigh any potential risks, says Marco Cavaleri, head of public-health threats at the European Medicines Agency in Amsterdam, Netherlands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03790-2" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03955-z/d41586-025-03955-z_51746366.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Psychedelics and immortality: &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; went to a health summit starring RFK and JD Vance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, US health secretary &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00439-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00439-y" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, who has long campaigned against vaccines, has argued that aluminium adjuvants are linked to autism and food allergies. In July, researchers in Denmark published a study of more than one million children that found no such link&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02682-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02682-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;called for the study to be retracted&lt;/a&gt;; the journal declined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACIP advisers, handpicked by Kennedy, will discuss the use of aluminium in vaccines this week, but they have not yet scheduled a vote. Any requirement to eliminate aluminium would be a shock to the system, says Cavaleri, and would render some crucial vaccines ineffective. “You cannot just get rid of an adjuvant that works and is safe before you have something else that you know will be a good replacement,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting specific&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It is the universal punchline of family jokes, awkward elevator moments and schoolyard humour. The rotten-egg scent that fills the air is rarely associated with anything remotely beneficial. Yet science has a habit of turning the unexpected into the intriguing, and a new study suggests that the very gas behind that notorious smell may hold clues to protecting the ageing brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2017225118" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Johns Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;have found that hydrogen sulfide, the pungent gas responsible for the stench of flatulence, could play a surprising role in slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. The finding may sound like the setup to a comedy sketch, but the science behind it is anything but.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Inflammation a significant factor contributing to Alzheimer's disease: Study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The surprising science behind farts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen sulfide is produced naturally in the body in extremely small amounts and helps regulate essential cellular functions. According to the researchers, these levels decline with age and drop even further in people with Alzheimer’s. Their study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that restoring this gas to healthy levels may help the brain function more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this theory, scientists experimented on mice genetically engineered to mimic Alzheimer’s disease. Over 12 weeks, the animals received a slow-release compound called NaGYY, designed to deliver controlled doses of hydrogen sulfide throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results exceeded expectations. Mice given the compound performed up to 50 percent better in memory and motor tests compared with those that received no treatment. They were more active, more alert and better able to retain information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why this stinky gas matters for the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team discovered that when hydrogen sulfide levels fall too low, a crucial process in the brain begins to break down. An enzyme known as GSK3β becomes overly attracted to the protein Tau. When they bind improperly, Tau starts forming clumps inside nerve cells. These tangled proteins block communication between neurons, eventually killing them and leading to the cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen sulfide helps prevent this harmful chain reaction. By restoring the gas to normal levels, researchers saw improved signalling between brain cells and a reduction in toxic protein buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this could mean for future treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compound used in the study allowed researchers to mimic the body’s natural production of hydrogen sulfide for the first time with precision. While the findings are promising, scientists stress that this does not mean smelling flatulence is beneficial or advisable. Hydrogen sulfide is toxic at high concentrations, and the health effects observed in the study came only from carefully measured, microscopic doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the research opens an unexpected path in the search for Alzheimer’s treatments. A gas known primarily for embarrassment and jokes may one day help scientists better understand, and potentially slow, one of the world’s most devastating neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the most unlikely smells carry the most surprising science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:28:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAJBVV95cUxNMkpIWEVJdkdhUkVCVjZMVmdpeTRwMlBISURxVWRzbklDMHpZN3JzUk1GU3RpTHFqQmpNWGg2amRSS1d4bWYtQ25mZFpjVVIyRVA3Z05LMzdrZEpRUm5ZbkV4andic19VM2VMbDd2a1o4dUhJZVhhbmdxM0hTQ3R6a3A2Z05tQmwwdjhqN01IbXlJdGgtR3hhYjFhdVJMSWxUZkh3MXJib2F2ZmVzeGplZFlLWkZ0SkJPS0xMc2tVTHpoM0lTeEx4RTExSC0wZC1fcE9yeEs1aEFWY0lMM2N0bUxPWkJhSXhXOFhDUzJJY0Zha080cE4xcHIxSmo5eUxrUTFVYVAtaE1TUjZqNElWUw</guid></item><item><title>65岁的祖母在被诊断出致命疾病之前被告知她的头晕是由于抑郁症造成的-雅虎加拿大新闻</title><link>https://ca.news.yahoo.com/grandmother-65-told-her-dizziness-130942459.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pamela Cook began feeling unwell in September 2023 and was prescribed antidepressants by her doctor, her daughter told British charity Brain Tumor research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When the 65-year-old's symptoms, including feeling dizzy, didn't improve, doctors told her to give the medication more time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shortly after, Cook ended up in the emergency room and was given an MRI scan that revealed a deadly diagnosis&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A grandmother who died from an aggressive brain tumor in March 2024 was initially told her symptoms were due to depression, her family has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pamela Cook, 65, from Lincoln, England, began feeling unwell in the fall of 2023 when she started experiencing dizziness, headaches and forgetfulness, according to British charity Brain Tumour Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There were no clear signs that anything was wrong at first,” her daughter Clair Bowkett said in a &lt;a href="https://braintumourresearch.org/blogs/in-our-hearts/pamela-cook?srsltid=AfmBOoqjnfPI-QizjuEh2iXCpjvWmD1bHBKDZjyCTGj-0qKG1eCpwyyq" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:news release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt; on the charity's website. “Mum had always been a bit forgetful. We used to laugh when she called everyone’s names before finally getting to the right one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, it wasn’t until September 2023 when Cook “began to feel dizzy, tired, and low in confidence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“She went to the doctor, who said it was depression and prescribed antidepressants,” Bowkett recalled. “When she didn’t improve, she went back, but they told her to give the tablets more time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She continued, “Not long after that she followed my stepdad, Dave, downstairs one evening and forgot why she was there. She was frightened, and that was when he realised something wasn’t right.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain Tumour Research / SWNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pamela Cook wearing her radiotherapy mask&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cook was taken to the emergency department by her husband before being given an MRI scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In the early hours of the morning, I got a call to say they had found a tumour in Mum’s brain,”  Bowkett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her mother was given steroids to help with swelling “and for a little while it felt like we had her back,” Bowkett continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But sadly, Cook was subsequently diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive and fast-growing brain tumor. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/glioblastoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20569077" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, glioblastoma is a type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the brain or spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain Tumour Research / SWNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pamela Cook with her dog Frankie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Mum had surgery at Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham in November 2023,” Bowkett said. “The surgeons managed to remove a large part of the tumour but not all of it. She started six weeks of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy over Christmas and into the new year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It was brutal,” she continued. “She became weak, developed infections, and was admitted to hospital several times.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then, in February 2024, Cook was told that another tumor had grown back in the same place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Doctors told us there was nothing more they could do,” Bowkett said, adding that the family decided to bring their mother home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After celebrating her birthday, Cook’s health deteriorated and she began having seizures before losing her speech and mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She died on March 24, 2024, 10 days after her daughter’s birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It is so hard to make sense of how fast it all happened.

																			&lt;p class="tagline"&gt;Standing exercises become more important than ever after turning 60.&lt;/p&gt;
												
																			
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;If you’re 60 and don’t have standing moves in your workout rotation, you should consider adding them. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/standing-core-workouts-no-crunches/" target="_blank"&gt;Standing workouts&lt;/a&gt; activate many muscles, helping to improve core strength, balance, and posture. They’re also more neck and back-friendly than floor work. We spoke with an expert who shares four standing moves that indicate you’re &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/4-moves-stronger-than-most-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;fitter than most 40-year-olds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/standing-exercises-reverse-aging-after-45/" target="_blank"&gt;Standing exercises&lt;/a&gt; are more important than ever after you hit 60, because they challenge the muscles that keep you steady and upright in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you’re on your feet, you’re training your legs, hips, core, and back to support your body the way they do when you walk, climb stairs, or get up from a chair,” says &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://nynjspine.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Gbolahan Okubadejo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, NYC area orthopaedic and spinal surgeon. “From my perspective as a spine and orthopedic surgeon, that kind of functional strength is what protects people from falls, back strain, and the gradual loss of balance that often sneaks up with age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing workouts also fire up the small stabilizing muscles around the joints and spine, which don’t receive much use when performing seated movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over time, these exercises help maintain posture, preserve bone density through weight-bearing stress, and keep the body moving fluidly instead of stiffening up,” Dr. Okubadejo tells us. “It’s one of the simplest ways to hold on to independence and confidence as you get older.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These standing moves are key markers of strong functional fitness at 60.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="single-leg-balance" class="o-slide-title" data-num="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Single-Leg Balance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Being able to stand on one leg for 20 to 30 seconds without wobbling is a big sign of solid hip strength and good neuromuscular control,” Dr. Okubadejo explains. “Balance is one of the first things to decline with age, and strong stabilizers around the hips and spine are what keep someone safe from falls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balance on one leg, barefoot, on a flat, solid surface without using additional support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your gaze forward and your arms crossed. The lifted leg should not touch your grounded leg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The time begins once your leg comes off the floor and stops when your foot touches the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balance for at least 20 to 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The sit-to-stand test is a simple move that shows powerful leg strength—especially in the quadriceps and glutes, along with a stable core,” Dr. Okubadejo tells us. “If a 60-year-old can stand up smoothly from a chair and sit back down under control, it tells me their joints, muscles, and balance systems are working together the way they should in daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin seated on a firm chair with your arms crossed and feet flat on the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand up completely without using your hands for support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return back to a seated position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to stand up and sit back down with control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="standing-hip-hinge" class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Standing Hip Hinge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gs6--_Mk3WE?si=gRmcJgDkyWJrYgT4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A clean hip hinge shows good hamstring flexibility, strong glutes, and a back that is staying supported rather than overworked,” Dr. Okubadejo says. “This pattern protects the spine during bending, lifting, and reaching. When someone can hinge without rounding their back, it shows a healthy understanding of how to move in a spine safe way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart, core engaged, and knees bent slightly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your hands on your hips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press your hips straight back, maintaining a tall chest and neutral spine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower your torso until you feel a solid stretch in your hamstrings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive your hips forward to return to a standing position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="standing-heel-raises" class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Standing Heel Raises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rising up onto the toes and lowering slowly builds calf strength and ankle stability,” Dr. Okubadejo explains. “Strong heel raises reflect the kind of lower leg strength needed for a steady gait, climbing stairs, and catching themselves if they trip.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift your heels off the ground to rise onto the balls of your feet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold for a moment at the top, feeling a solid stretch in your calves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gradually lower to the start position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to rise and lower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When someone can perform all four movements with control, it usually means their legs, hips, core, and balance systems are aging in a healthy way and they’re better equipped to stay active, independent, and injury-free,” Dr. Okubadejo notes.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has ever visited Italy will quickly notice the differences between regional Italian cuisine and the more common Italian-American foods served in North America. Both types of cuisine have something wonderful to offer diners, and while Italian-American food might not be as authentic as what you’d get in a Milan trattoria, there are many &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/fast-growing-pizza-chains-expanding-soon/" target="_blank"&gt;pizza&lt;/a&gt; chains that are serving up delicious pies even Italians (and those familiar with authentic Italian cuisine) approve of.

    &lt;p&gt;Most of us go through the day without thinking much about our bodies – until something goes wrong. Yet beneath that apparent simplicity lies a remarkable achievement: the brain must constantly knit together sights, touches and signals from muscles and joints into a coherent sense of “this body is mine”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychologists and neuroscientists call this body ownership. It is a key part of self-consciousness: the feeling of being a self located in a particular body, separate from the world around you. It’s partly what makes us different to AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, theories have proposed that a lot of this bodily processing happens outside awareness. It’s a kind of unconscious process that quietly guides our movements while consciousness focuses on other things. Now &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2503629122"&gt;our new study challenges this idea&lt;/a&gt; – giving interesting insights into theories of consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most experiments on consciousness have used flashes of light or sounds, asking &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52778-5"&gt;when and how these external stimuli reach awareness&lt;/a&gt;. Surprisingly, very little work has directly tested how conscious awareness relates to the bodily self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rubber hand experiments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, we used a modern version of the famous &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/35784"&gt;rubber hand illusion&lt;/a&gt;. In this illusion, a participant’s real hand is hidden from view while a lifelike rubber hand is placed in front of them. If both hands are stroked in synchrony, most people begin to feel that the rubber hand is, strangely, part of their own body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We built a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027723001257"&gt;robotic set-up&lt;/a&gt; that allowed us to control this illusion with millisecond precision. In our main experiment, 32 participants saw two rubber hands side by side, while a robot tapped their real, hidden hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On every trial, one rubber hand was tapped in perfect synchrony with the real hand and the other was tapped with a slight delay – from 18 to 150 milliseconds. After a short sequence of taps, people had to choose which rubber hand felt more like their own. Then they rated how clear that feeling was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gave us two things to compare. One was objective performance – how accurately people’s feeling of hand ownership could tell which hand matched their real hand’s timing. The second was subjective awareness – how clearly they reported feeling that sense of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a lot of body ownership processing happens unconsciously, we might expect people to be more likely to pick the correct rubber hand, even when they report only a vague or unclear feeling of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/705379/original/file-20251129-56-1ot0f8.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The rubber hand illusion with two rubber hands presented simultaneously.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;Illustration by Mattias Karlén&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"&gt;CC BY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not what we found. As we increased the lack of synchrony between the real and fake hands, people became better at picking the “correct” hand. Crucially, their awareness ratings improved in lockstep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both objective performance and reported clarity started to rise at around 30 milliseconds of mismatch. Below that, people were essentially guessing; above that, they both chose more accurately and reported clearer feelings of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, as soon as the brain started to reliably tell the difference between “my hand” and “not my hand”, people’s conscious experience reflected that difference. We did not see the common pattern reported in visual studies, where &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01004-5"&gt;unconscious processing can occur before stimuli reach awareness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Body ownership vs timing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test whether this was really about body ownership – rather than simply noticing timing – we ran two control experiments. When we rotated the rubber hands into an anatomically impossible position, the illusion disappeared and people mostly reported no clear feeling of ownership, regardless of timing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when we replaced the hands with wooden blocks and asked people to judge simultaneity instead of ownership, their awareness no longer tracked their performance as tightly. This suggests that strong conscious access is specific to body ownership, not just to any kind of multisensory integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In further experiments, we asked whether the same close relationship holds when body ownership builds up gradually. In one study, we varied how many taps people received before making their choice. More taps meant more sensory evidence. As expected, their ability to discriminate ownership improved with more touches. But again, their awareness ratings improved proportionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, our findings point to a simple but powerful conclusion: for body ownership, consciousness seems to have continuous, privileged access to the relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contrasts with many studies of vision and hearing, where stimuli can be processed and influence behaviour without ever entering awareness. It suggests that the bodily self may occupy a special place in our conscious lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason may be that body ownership is intrinsically self-related: it anchors a first-person perspective in space and underpins almost everything else we experience. Another is that it depends on complex integration across many senses, which may require the kind of &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30052-0"&gt;widespread brain activation associated with conscious experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Implications for mental health&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding how body ownership and awareness are linked is not just a philosophical exercise. Distortions of bodily self-perception are common in conditions such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0920996420305788"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/abs/increased-plasticity-of-the-bodily-self-in-eating-disorders/72CFF2C84E34FD7798C6CC6775F3CA0A"&gt;eating disorders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2019/1/niz017/5692683"&gt;borderline personality disorder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-011-1430-7"&gt;autism spectrum disorders&lt;/a&gt;, where people may feel alienated from their bodies or misperceive their size, shape or boundaries. Our work offers new tools to study how finely tuned the system is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings also resonate with rapidly developing technologies in virtual reality and prosthetics. Many applications aim to “embody” a user in a digital or artificial body. Knowing that body ownership is tightly tied to awareness suggests that successful embodiment will depend on keeping multisensory signals aligned in a way that sustains a clear, conscious sense of “this is me”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, our results speak to big-picture theories of consciousness. If information about our own body is almost always admitted into awareness, this supports the idea that maintaining a stable, embodied self may be one of the core functions of conscious experience. This perspective ultimately highlights a key gap between humans and current artificial systems, challenging the idea that AI – at least in its current forms – could resemble human consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Is stubborn belly overhang weighing you down? Ater 50, it may feel like no matter how many crunches you do, how many walks you go on, or how many salads you eat, nothing really changes when it comes to your waistline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the truth most people never hear: a &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/5-no-equipment-core-exercises-no-planks/" target="_blank"&gt;well-defined core&lt;/a&gt; isn’t sculpted by endless ab workouts. It’s built by training your entire body to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/5-standing-exercises-burn-more-calories-than-running-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;torch more calories&lt;/a&gt;, activate deep core muscles, and move in ways that mimic real life movements. Crunches and burpees don’t do that. Standing exercises do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12205185/" target="_blank" data-citation="true" data-citation-type="ScholarlyArticle"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; show that &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/5-standing-exercises-melt-belly-pooch-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;standing exercises&lt;/a&gt; can boost quality of life by helping improve those things that naturally decline with age, but impact how your midsection looks and feels, such as posture, coordination, balance, and functional strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re over 50 and looking to trim your midsection, we have good news. We chatted with &lt;b&gt;James Brady&lt;/b&gt;, a certified personal trainer at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.origym.co.uk/blog/author/jbrady/" target="_blank"&gt;OriGym&lt;/a&gt;, who shares his top 5 standing exercises to help you flatten belly overhang faster than any ab workout. “After 50, flattening belly overhang isn’t about doing more crunches,” Brady says. “It’s about combining total-body strength work, core stability, and consistent movement that burns calories and builds lean muscle.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking lunges are among the most effective standing exercises for tightening your midsection because they &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0212216" target="_blank"&gt;force your entire core to stabilize&lt;/a&gt; with every step. “Walking lunges are a powerhouse for burning fat and tightening your midsection,” says Brady. “They engage the glutes, quads, and core, which helps lift and flatten the lower belly overhang.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step forward with your right foot and lower into a lunge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push through your front heel to rise as your back leg steps forward into the next lunge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your torso upright and your core engaged throughout the entire movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete three sets of 10 to 12 lunges per leg. Rest for 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deadlifts may not top your list when you think of “belly-fat eliminating” exercises, but no other standing movement &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229507" target="_blank"&gt;recruits as many muscles at once&lt;/a&gt;, which includes muscles in your back, hips, hamstrings, and deep core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Deadlifts work every major muscle group and trigger a strong hormonal response that supports fat loss,” explains Brady. “Strengthening your posterior chain also improves posture, which instantly makes your stomach appear flatter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this exercise, you can use dumbbells, a kettlebell, or your bodyweight if you’re new to the movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with your feet hip-width apart, holding weights in front of your thighs (optional).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hinge at the hips while keeping your spine long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower the weights toward your shins or stop at mid-thigh if using no weight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your glutes to return to standing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform three sets of 10 to 12 reps. Rest for 90 to 120 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incline walking is one of the most underrated belly-fat reducers, as it’s low-impact, joint-friendly, and forces your body to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11798546/" target="_blank"&gt;burn more calories&lt;/a&gt; than regular walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Low-impact incline walking is one of the best steady-state fat-burning exercises if you’re over 50,” says Brady. “It’s gentle on the joints but keeps your core engaged to stabilise your torso.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set your treadmill to a 5 to 10% incline or find a hill outside you can walk up safely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk at a moderate pace where you can still hold a conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your posture tall and avoid leaning on the treadmill handles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk for 20 to 30 minutes, or break it into shorter intervals. (For example, five rounds of four minute walks, with one minute rest between each.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2840817/" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, shoulder taps activate muscles in your deep core, obliques (side abs), back, and hips. While you’re not technically “standing” with this exercise, you’re still on your feet in a high-plank position.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This plank variation strengthens deep core muscles that support your spine and flatten your midsection,” explains Brady. “Unlike crunches, it trains your body to hold tension and improve real-world strength.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start in a high plank position with your hands under your shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Widen your feet slightly for balance and stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap your right hand to your left shoulder without letting your hips sway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat for three sets of 10 to 12 taps per side. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you could only pick one movement for fat loss and full-body strength, this might be it. The squat to press blends a lower-body burner with an upper-body power move, raising your heart rate quickly and kickstarting your body’s calorie-burning engine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compound movements like the squat to press raise your heart rate while building strength across multiple muscle groups,” says Brady. “It’s a double win for burning belly fat and improving overall fitness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold a pair of light dumbbells at shoulder height (or water bottles).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower into a squat with your hips back as if sitting into a chair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand up and press the weights overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring them back to your shoulders with control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat for three sets of 10 to 12 reps. Rest for 90 to 120 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

While their consumption is particularly high in the west, forming more than half the average diet in the UK and the US, for example, UPFs are replacing fresh food in diets on every continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This month, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/18/ultra-processed-food-linked-to-harm-in-every-major-human-organ-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the world’s largest review&lt;/a&gt; on the health threats of UPFs was published in the Lancet. It warned that such foods are exposing millions of people to long-term harm, and called for urgent action. Earlier this year Unicef revealed that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/sep/10/junk-food-upf-more-children-obese-than-underweight-unicef" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more children around the world were obese than underweight&lt;/a&gt; for the first time, as junk food overwhelms diets, with the steepest rises in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Carlos Monteiro, professor of public health nutrition at the University of São Paulo, and one of the Lancet series’ authors, says that profit-driven corporations, not individual choices, are driving the change in habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For parents, it can feel like the entire food system is working against them. “Sometimes it feels like we have zero control over what we are putting on to our kid’s plate,” says one mother from &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/india" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;. We spoke to her and four other parents from around the world on the growing challenges and frustrations of providing a healthy diet in the age of UPFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="nepal-she-craves-cookies-chocolate-and-juice" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Nepal: ‘She craves cookies, chocolate and juice’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Raising a child in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nepal" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt; today often feels like trying to swim against the current, especially when it comes to food. I cook at home as much as I can, but the moment my daughter steps outside, she is surrounded by brightly packaged snacks and sugary drinks. She constantly craves cookies, chocolates and packaged fruit juices – products aggressively advertised to children. A single pizza commercial on TV is enough for her to ask, “Can we have pizza today?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even the school environment reinforces unhealthy habits. Her canteen serves sweetened fruit juice every Tuesday, which she eagerly awaits. She receives a six-piece biscuit pack from a friend on the school bus and chocolates on birthdays, and faces a chip shop right outside her school gate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ae9f538a-796a-434f-b194-58a52fdc2378" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Even the school environment reinforces unhealthy habits’: Manita Pyakurel and her daughter Merissa. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Handout&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some days it feels like the entire food environment is working against parents who are simply trying to raise healthy children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As someone working in the Nepal Non-Communicable Disease Alliance and leading a project called Promoting Healthy Foods in Schools to Reduce NCD Risk Factors, I understand this issue deeply. Yet even with my expertise, keeping my eight-year-old daughter healthy is incredibly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These repeated exposures at school, in transit and online make it nearly impossible for parents to limit ultra-processed foods. It is not just about children’s choices; it is about a food system that normalises and promotes unhealthy eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And the data reflects exactly what families like mine are experiencing. The &lt;a href="https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR379/FR379.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nepal Demographic and Health Survey&lt;/a&gt; 2022 found that 69% of children between six and 23 months ate unhealthy foods, and 43% were already drinking sweetened beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These numbers echo what I see every day. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31387571/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; conducted in the Lalitpur district, where I live, reported that 18.6% of schoolchildren were overweight and 7.1% were obese, figures closely associated with the rise in junk food consumption and increasingly inactive lifestyles. Another study showed that many Nepali children eat sweet snacks or processed savoury foods almost daily, and this regular consumption is tied to high levels of tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nepal urgently needs stronger policies, healthier school environments and stricter marketing regulations. Until then, families will continue fighting a daily battle against junk food – one biscuit packet at a time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manita Pyakurel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="st-vincent-and-the-grenadines-greasy-salty-sugary-fast-food-is-the-preference" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;St Vincent and the Grenadines: ‘Greasy, salty, sugary fast food is the preference’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;My situation is a bit unique as I was forced to relocate from an island in our archipelago that was devastated by Hurricane Beryl last year.

Fresh, healthy food becomes scarce and very expensive, so it is really difficult to get your kids to eat right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="049e02df-444f-4fb0-abe3-0f91dd56705c" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Arlene Williams-Jack with two of her children, Jonathan and Alina.

Serving fewer meals or smaller servings have also become part of the post-Beryl coping strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Also it is quite convenient when you are juggling a demanding job with parenting, and rushing around in the morning, to just give the children $2 or $3 to buy snacks at school. Unfortunately, most school tuck shops only offer ultra-processed snacks and sugary sodas. The result of these challenges, I fear, is an increase in the already epidemic rates of lifestyle diseases such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arlene Williams-Jack, as told to Natricia Duncan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="uganda-its-in-every-mall-and-every-market" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Uganda: ‘It’s in every mall and every market’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The KFC sign looms large at the entrance of Akamwesi, a mall in Mpererwe neighbourhood in Kampala, daring you to pass by without stopping at the drive-through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many of the children and parents visiting the mall have never gone beyond the borders of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/uganda" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;.

As one of the more expensive options, KFC is considered a treat. It is the place Kampala’s families go to celebrate birthdays and baptisms.

In fact, they are hoping their parents take them for Christmas at KFC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Mom, do you know that some people pack KFC for school lunch,” my 14-year-old daughter, who attends a school between Mpererwe and the more upscale neighbourhood of Acacia, tells me.

I hope the aroma of chicken slow boiled for hours and served with fresh vegetables from the market will triumph over the allure of fast food.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patience Akumu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="india-it-can-feel-like-we-have-zero-control" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;India: ‘It can feel like we have zero control’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When I was growing up, we literally ate everything. There was not much awareness about what was healthy and what was unhealthy. Today, what children can and can’t eat it is a constant conversation – in school, at home, in the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;My daughter loves ice-cream and chocolates. Her grandparents are very indulgent, and I often have to put my foot down. I try to rationalise the amount she eats, but it is difficult. What I hate most are lollipops. They are sticky, messy and she keeps them in her mouth for hours. Sometimes I give in because it is tiring to constantly be on top of this. As working professionals, it is not always possible to do everything from scratch, such as paneer (homemade cottage cheese). However, a &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/india/fake-cheese-indian-restaurants-analogue-paneer-b2742083.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent scandal&lt;/a&gt; surrounding synthetic paneer had me concerned for days, as we source store-bought paneer on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It also does not help that when we go shopping all the treats and chocolates are right at the checkout. My daughter often accompanies me to the store and asks me to buy chocolates or some other packaged snack. Even things like peanut chikki (like a brittle) that I grew up eating are highly processed today. If I say no, she sulks a little, saying I always say no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The rule in our home is no refined sugar, no fizzy drinks. That means no biscuits, which are basically made of maida (refined flour) and palm oil. My doctor tells me it sticks to children’s teeth and gives them cavities. But when someone else offers them, she goes nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="081e9c48-5964-4fae-9aea-2a770ff94a56" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Amoolya Rajappa and her five-year-old daughter Ibbani, who ‘loves ice-cream and chocolates’.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Handout&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I try to read the ingredients on the packaging, and anything that lists more than 10, I don’t buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sometimes it feels like we have zero control over what we are putting on to our kid’s plate and that sense of helplessness is very frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Moreover, there are very few options available for wholesome snacks in the Indian market and they are very pricey. So, economically speaking, it is also a constant challenge to ensure my child is eating healthy and balanced meals all the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amoolya Rajappa, as told to Anuradha Nagaraj&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="kenya-one-bite-and-he-was-hooked" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Kenya: ‘One bite and he was hooked’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;My son says it all started when he saw his friends eating things he knew he wasn’t allowed to. One bite and he was hooked. He was probably nine. The Indonesian noodles were one of the tastiest things he had ever eaten, he told me. Having heard and read what these foods were doing to the health of young people around the world, I was not happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But that initial taste piqued his curiosity and he started trying to introduce &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/dec/28/how-instant-noodles-took-over-the-world-salt" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;instant noodles&lt;/a&gt; to the weekly shop – by stealth. Our nearby mall was the crime scene. During one visit, he snuck a pack of beef-flavoured noodles from either Singapore or South Korea, burying it under other items. I was too distracted to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He repeated the move during another shopping trip. This time I was keen enough to notice not one, but three packets of UPFs in the trolley. He had to return them to the shelves, much to the consternation of other shoppers queueing at the checkout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c96e7b25-cdea-46ba-8d2e-bd32d262038f" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Peter Muiruri and his son, who is starting to appreciate healthy eating.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Handout&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But just removing such items from the shopping basket is not enough. What do you replace them with? So many exotic treats that appeal to children carry health risks. I sat in a recent media briefing where an eye doctor said that many young people presenting with eyesight issues are being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. “They come for an eye checkup but unknown to their parents, diabetes is the root cause of the eyesight issues,” she said. “Junk food is at the centre of the declining health among young people in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/kenya" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Kenya&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While local markets abound with healthy foods such as tubers and traditional vegetables, it has been a constant battle getting my son, now 14, to eat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Happily, he is slowly adjusting to healthy eating habits. “It comes with age,” he joked recently. “Junk food is really appealing but it doesn’t help much. You could eat all you want but after about an hour you’ll have to eat &lt;em&gt;ugali&lt;/em&gt; [stiff dough made of maize flour] and &lt;em&gt;sukuma wiki&lt;/em&gt; [a dish made using greens] – to fill you up.” &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It was two days after Halloween, and my 44th birthday party at Lion’s Roar Karaoke House in Williamsburg was already in full swing. Younger attendees sang along with gusto to hits that were popular when they were in their 20s in the 2010s. During that decade, I was too occupied with reproduction and its consequences to pay much attention to the inexorable rise of Ariana Grande. Toward the end of the party, I performed “What’s Up,” by 4 Non Blondes, a song I’ve been karaokeing ever since its opening lines — “Twenty-five years and my life is still / trying to get up that great big hill of hope / for a destination” — were literally true. “Forty-four years and my life is still,” I sang that night. I spent the week after the party feeling hung-over, though I’m sober. When I looked at the photos of me at the mic, it was hard not to compare them to a slideshow my mother had sent me a few weeks earlier on my actual birthday. I’m pretty sure her collection had been automatically generated by Apple’s facial-recognition algorithm, but it still felt like an attack. In all of the pictures, some of which were taken with my mom’s first iPhone 14 years ago, I was so cute, so bright-eyed, so thin, so &lt;em&gt;young.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757by00133b7802q8t578@published" data-word-count="152"&gt;Of course, I am still relatively young, at least compared to how old I hope to be in the future. And I’m often told that I don’t look my age, which is probably because of the way I dress (casual-disheveled) and how many tattoos I have, two of which are Gen-Z-coded stick-and-pokes rather than millennial-coded full color. But it’s also because the full impact of middle age hasn’t slapped me across the face yet. I might be deluding myself, but I feel like I still credibly blend in among my younger co-workers. The illusion isn’t punctured unless we start reminiscing about high school. Once, in a meeting, I mentioned that my school had put stricter security measures in place “after Columbine” and fleetingly saw the “Sure, Grandma, let’s get you to bed” meme flash across my colleagues’ faces. Mostly, over the past few years, I have felt like an old young person.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757de00143b78jwv855da@published" data-word-count="107"&gt;The feeling seems pretty common in my generation. We are in some senses younger than every middle-aged cohort before us. It’s been much more difficult for older millennials and cusp X-ers to attain the career status our parents had at our ages. Many live without a financial safety net, keeping us young in the “furniture from the street” way. We’re less likely to own homes or have emergency savings. When layoffs come around, both the high-powered boomers above us and the less-pricey Gen-Z kids on their way up are more likely to hang on to their jobs — at least until AI replaces the kids, then us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757f100153b78m6g4rgww@published" data-word-count="170"&gt;It’s also possible, though expensive, for us to appear far younger than our parents did at our ages via Botox, fillers, and those red-light LED masks that make you look like a scary robot. We’ve all seen that photo of 70-year-old Kris Jenner looking 25; with enough money, we know we can opt out of many physical signs of our decrepitude. We might dress younger than our power-suited mothers did. Grown-ups are no longer identifiable via business-casual uniforms and staid haircuts; the pandemic has erased many offices’ taboo against wearing soft pants. If we want, we’re deluged with all the information in the world about what young people are wearing, listening to, reading, saying, and doing the moment we open our apps. We can swim in the same waters as them, and we often do without even thinking about it: TV shows based on YA novels or set in high schools are just as popular with 40-somethings as they are with viewers in the age bracket of the characters onscreen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757gp00163b78lmoql9yd@published" data-word-count="207"&gt;Add to all this: The world doesn’t really treat us like old people anymore. When we were kids, 40 was famously “over the hill.” To me, 40 felt more like another journalistic deadline I was blowing; there were lots of things I’d hoped to have achieved by that point in my life, but I would just have to ask the universe for an extension. I didn’t think about my body falling apart or my mortality as much as I mourned the loss of my identity as a precocious person. I’d spent my 20s being the youngest person in the meeting, an interloper in the world of established Gen-X-ers, racing to publish my first book before I turned 30. Then I spent my 30s recovering from and atoning for everything I’d said and done in service of my ambition, and reproducing. Soon after my 40th birthday, I got a full-time job for the first time in eight years and was suddenly a decade older than some of my bosses. No one accorded me the respect owed to an elder stateswoman; I was competing for the same opportunities as the 26-year-olds who shared my job description but not my extracurricular responsibilities, who were then 4 and 7 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

While people were no longer rolling over the hill at 40, the new received wisdom said I’d soon be arriving at something more extreme: the cliff. The term entered the lexicon last year with Miranda July’s novel &lt;em&gt;All Fours&lt;/em&gt; — which featured a diagram of the abrupt nosedive women’s hormones take sometime in our fourth decade — and the concept was expanded and reinforced by the publication that August of a widely discussed “nonlinear aging” study from Stanford. That research seemed to confirm something we already sort of knew: There are certain years in life when aging hits us hard and moves us forward at hyperspeed. Forty-four, according to the study, is the first of those years. Sixty is the next, and there may yet be more cliffs to be discovered. The Stanford scientists found these transition points by examining the markers of cellular aging in roughly 100 people between the ages of 25 and 75. Over the course of the study’s 12-year duration, they discovered these markers became increasingly dysregulated in bursts around certain ages. At first, they were skeptical that 44 was a true aberration, thinking that perimenopausal symptoms must be skewing their results. But when they broke the data out by sex, they found that men were experiencing the same key changes women were: increased risk of cardiovascular disease and reduced ability to metabolize fat, alcohol, and caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757ko00183b78izjdoyei@published" data-word-count="260"&gt;I first read the study about six months before my 44th birthday. Mostly, it made me feel guilty and scared. At 43, I wasn’t exactly being proactive about my physical health. Some of the factors were out of my control — or at least they felt that way. I was on a cocktail of medications for bipolar disorder that all had sedative effects; no matter how much coffee I drank, I couldn’t seem to muster the energy to do something as ambitious as “going to the gym.” Besides, I had no time: I spent every waking hour either taking care of my kids or working, the exception being a brief period between 9:30 and 11 p.m. that I spent watching TV with my husband in a semi-prone position on the couch. Caffeine was my god. Nicotine, I’m ashamed to admit, was also my god in the form of Juul pods. Cutting out refined sugar seemed like the first step toward a Goop-ian nightmare with orthorexia at its inevitable end point. GLP-1’s were for rich people. My lifestyle wasn’t exactly a point of pride, but I didn’t see how I could be expected to do much better. Between constant deadlines and family stressors, my central nervous system was in a perpetual state of near collapse. My periods had been weird for several years. And underneath it all was low-level dread that this was just the beginning of my irreversible decline. Whether I fell off the cliff or not, I’d still be lucky to reach 88. I was in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;

The media coverage of the Stanford study was no different. Much of it suggested that the cliff might be preventable or at least could be delayed. But the potential remedies offered were cold comfort: They were the commonsensical things doctors always recommend — get enough sleep, reduce stress, exercise moderately with an emphasis on strength training, stop eating refined sugar and processed food. Boring! Also: Impossible?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757sd001b3b78amalqnny@published" data-word-count="193"&gt;I wondered what the study’s researchers thought of this, and I also didn’t feel totally confident that I’d comprehended the paper — which includes sentences like “Phosphatidylinositols are a class of phospholipids that have various roles in cytoskeleton organization” — so I called Dr. Michael Snyder, its senior author. Answering the phone, he told me I’d caught him just as he’d finished his morning exercise routine, which includes both cardio and strength training. The study is ongoing, and Snyder is himself a formal participant, getting his own samples analyzed along with the others. He told me he doesn’t believe that the aging cliffs are an immutable fact of biology. The changes he and his team documented, he said, are a representation of what currently is, not what might potentially be. If people go into their late 30s and 40s with the understanding that their bodies are going to distinctly change — that they’re not going to be able to get by merely doing what they’ve always done — then they have a chance to improve their outcomes. So far, the study has not provided any meaningful conclusions about whether this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757tu001c3b78suoq6qji@published" data-word-count="201"&gt;Snyder’s take fits comfortably with the orthodoxy of our time: that our health is adaptable, that everything is possible if we look, if we research, if we try. But the reality of aging is evident all around us. In the months before I turned 44, I talked to quite a few people who had already crossed that threshold, the first drop. They talked about injuries and illnesses and some bodily changes that had never even crossed my mind. Multiple people mentioned plantar fasciitis, inflammation of the band of tissue on the sole of the foot. My days walking around barefoot, which I’d been taking completely for granted, were apparently numbered. “My feet just stopped working last year,” said Samantha Tunis, 45. “I took a dance class and felt great during, and then the next day I couldn’t put any weight on my right foot.” Sufferers can experience pain so extreme that they have difficulty standing and walking, and there’s no quick fix. The same thing happened to Jana when she was 43; her condition was so bad that she needed physical therapy and oral steroids — and this was during the pandemic, when she was walking everywhere with her stroller-age son.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757v7001d3b78vdtei5lv@published" data-word-count="88"&gt;I also heard from people who, at 44, had perfect vision one day and needed glasses the next. People who went from drinking three or four cocktails on a Thursday and waking up refreshed to being unable to tolerate more than a glass of wine without feeling hung-over for days. Women who felt like their skin texture had changed overnight, becoming saggy and crêpey instead of firm and taut. Several told me that they’d become basically unable to lose weight around 44, and some had turned to GLP-1’s.&lt;/p&gt;

At 43, she learned that she would need a double hip replacement. She’d previously been incredibly physically active: She loved spin, hot yoga, and Pilates, which she mixed with some weight training. But at 42, she noticed pains on the right side of her body, concentrated around her hip.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq757yc001f3b7885n4xgtj@published" data-word-count="99"&gt;An initial MRI diagnosed her with gluteal tendinosis, a glute tear, a hamstring tear, and a labral tear, all on the left. She also learned she had previously undiagnosed congenital hip dysplasia. The first orthopedic surgeon she talked to told her that, while her hips did need to be replaced, she was too young for the surgery — she would just need to replace them again in 20 years or so, when she’d be older and more susceptible to complications. Wright resolved to look for a surgeon who would give her the relief she needed as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

Doctors have told her not to engage in any physical activity more strenuous than walking, and even then, she’s not supposed to walk on “uneven surfaces,” a constant challenge in hilly Charlottesville, Virginia, where she lives. On a recent vacation, she found she needed the help of a cane to navigate the sand at the beach. She has to bring a padded cushion into restaurants because of the damage to her glutes. Her physical struggles have affected every aspect of her life, including her sex life and her relationship with her family.&lt;/p&gt;

In April, she underwent a surgery to shave off the top of her left femur, which has mitigated some of her pain without requiring a full hip replacement. Still, she is deeply bothered that there isn’t a clear explanation for what happened to her. “All the doctors, all the physical therapists, they always ask, ‘Was it an impact injury? How did this happen?’ And I can’t point to anything. I was very active, working with trainers. My body just started to fall apart.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq758ge001l3b78d4xpqgqo@published" data-word-count="126"&gt;I called a well-known gynecologist, Dr. Elizabeth Poynor, to get her read on how gender fits into nonlinear aging and also to sneakily get her permission to seek out hormone-replacement therapy. I’d been hearing and reading that it was beginning to be prescribed to women who are, like me, in the early stages of perimenopause (the eight-to-ten years before your periods stop completely, as you know if you’ve read any of the 10 million articles or novels recently published on the subject). Poynor has written extensively on the need to separate obstetrics and gynecology to allow doctors to focus on women who’ve aged out of the concerns endemic to the reproductive years. She has also treated Martha Stewart. I was very eager to hear her take.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq758i0001m3b78vhvvk2je@published" data-word-count="165"&gt;When she first read the Stanford study, Poynor told me, she was unsurprised that the changes it reported would be seen in women around 44 — it was somewhat intuitive given their fluctuating hormones and declining ovarian reserve. She’s an advocate for starting hormone-replacement therapy earlier rather than later. “We know that starting estrogen is associated with a lower level of insulin resistance,” she said. “So it does help to support metabolism.” Like Snyder, she detailed how important sleep, stress reduction, and regular exercise are, but I was more focused on finding a magic pill I could start taking. When July’s &lt;em&gt;All Fours&lt;/em&gt; heroine starts smearing progesterone cream on her thigh, it changes her life and her body, helping her transform from a thwarted artist in a settled-down hetero marriage into a horny gym rat who videotapes herself performing elaborate dance routines and only dates non-men. My own ambitions were more modest, but I still wanted to see what hormone therapy could do for me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq758jh001n3b78gigdrtw6@published" data-word-count="169"&gt;My psychiatrist gave me a recommendation for a gynecologist who specialized in perimenopause and didn’t take my insurance. The initial appointment was $1,200, but it was also an hour long, including 45 minutes of chitchat about my medical history that delved into areas like my astrological chart and my relationship to my mother. The gynecologist, by that point my new spiritual guru, did bloodwork and found that both my estrogen and my progesterone could stand to be topped up. After some trial and error — including a low-dose birth-control pill with synthetic progesterone that made me immediately depressed — I settled into a regime of bioidentical estrogen patches, applied weekly four times a month, and bioidentical progesterone, taken during the last two weeks of my cycle. A few months into the new system, my cycles were exactly 28 days long for the first time in four years, and I no longer spent days 14 to 22 convinced that all my friends hated me and my life’s ambitions were doomed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq758l1001o3b78zvqrnken@published" data-word-count="209"&gt;My appearance was going to be harder to hack. Out of the gate, I had a big advantage (knock wood): I have naturally plump cheeks and a smooth forehead, the genetic inheritance of my father and his mother, who both looked about 40 well into their 60s. I’ve never been tempted to try Botox. From the neck down, it’s a different story. I’d spent most of my adult life as a medium-thin person, thanks to a speedy metabolism and a freelance/intermittently employed writer’s schedule that left plenty of time for exercise. Then, with my first pregnancy, I experienced diastasis recti, where the midline of your abdominal muscles basically unzips (disgusting). Even though I did extensive physical therapy to get my abs to reunite, they never quite got all the way back together and then I got pregnant again. I have long arms and legs proportionate to my torso, and the bulge in my midsection has gotten me seats on the subway for years. I’ve tried not to let it bother me. But this became more difficult after I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed antipsychotics in 2022. I gained an intractable 30 pounds almost instantaneously after going on the drugs, even though nothing about my diet had changed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq758mf001p3b78ihif5m4l@published" data-word-count="175"&gt;For years, I have attempted to hypnotize myself into body positivity, or at least body neutrality, even as I’ve had to buy increasingly larger clothes. I subscribe to newsletters about the harmful effects of diet culture and the misogyny of big pharma, and I believe wholeheartedly that health is possible at any weight. And yet. When my new gynecologist asked me, in an offhand way, how I would feel about losing 30 pounds, somehow the first words that came out of my mouth emerged directly from my hindbrain: “It would feel like getting an extra $30,000 in my paycheck.” She didn’t hesitate to prescribe me Mounjaro. I didn’t meet my insurance’s criteria for GLP-1 coverage — my A1C, a measure of average blood-sugar levels, firmly indicated that I wasn’t prediabetic in the slightest, and my BMI didn’t qualify me as obese. But I decided I was willing to pay out of pocket, within reason. My gynecologist sent the prescription to a Canadian pharmacy so I could get the drug for around half its American cost.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq758o4001q3b78dm5unq1j@published" data-word-count="127"&gt;My honest review of Mounjaro is that it put me in a really weird headspace. Typically, I love food, even mediocre food; being hungry and then being satisfied is one of the very few small, reliable pleasures in my life. So the first few days of simply not feeling hungry at all, ever, were a mindfuck. I still ate because I understood, intellectually, that my body required sustenance. I came around on the appeal of things like smoothies and açai bowls — nonfoods you could consume without much effort or conscious thought at a desk or while scrolling through your phone. Mounjaro also made me so constipated that I resorted at one point to a message-board-recommended Israeli laxative that had roughly the same effect as colonoscopy-prep solution.&lt;/p&gt;

Overall, I would give the drug two out of five stars, and those stars are simply because the glimmer of hope associated with the decision to try it compelled me to join the Y and start swimming again and to go to one medium-intensity yoga class a week.&lt;/p&gt;

I quit vaping and started chewing nicotine gum and smoking the occasional cigarette instead, reasoning that cigarettes’ finite and meditative aspects were preferable to ingesting a near-constant stream of chemical vapor. We could generously call this a harm-reduction approach. I talked to my psychiatrist and began to taper down gradually on the most sedating of my various sedatives. Like all body-optimization projects, this is a work-in-progress.&lt;/p&gt;

Where is the line between a wholesome level of self-care and an obsessive, Pyrrhic war against an indomitable enemy? Consumer culture shouts at us constantly that we can always be doing more: We can hack our bodies, gathering data to improve almost everything about ourselves. But we’re also told that acceptance is the path toward peace and contentment. I thought about the older women I know, the ones well past middle age who seemed to have found a way to avoid being made insane by these contradictions. How had they become truly “older and wiser”?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq758yv001v3b78hw2jxqfd@published" data-word-count="175"&gt;I became friendly with Kim France, age 61, a couple years ago, when she and author Jennifer Romolini had me as a guest on their podcast, &lt;em&gt;Everything Is Fine, &lt;/em&gt;which is itself about navigating the second half of life&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Once upon a time, France was a staff writer at now-legendary &lt;em&gt;Sassy&lt;/em&gt; magazine. From there on, she had a thriving career in journalism — one that nearly took her out. She has written with skill and clarity about the soul-killing depression that she experienced at her professional pinnacle at &lt;em&gt;Lucky&lt;/em&gt; magazine, which she founded in 2000. In 2005, overworked, she had a manic episode that landed her in a psych unit. Though our lives don’t line up perfectly — France is partnered but happily child-free, and I’ve never had a Condé Nast car and driver or owned a townhouse — I’ve always felt I have a lot to learn from her example, particularly the way she’s reinvented herself throughout the decades while still coping with the inevitable ups and downs of life with chronic mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq75902001w3b781w2e1bmw@published" data-word-count="262"&gt;France wanted to reassure me that life is better for her now than it was in her 40s or even her 50s. Part of the reason, she said, is that she no longer feels “like an old person trying to be young.” She’d crossed over, she said, to being “a young old person. I’m in the freshman class.” More profoundly, she told me, a great equalizing has taken place: Most of her contemporaries have experienced life’s harshest realities. “If you get to be my age,” she said, “pretty much everyone has kind of walked through the fiery valley at least once. Something terrible has happened to them, something traumatic, something they had to get over. And when you’re 44, that’s not true. There’s something to being an age where you’ve come out the other end of all the drama that gets stirred up in your 40s.” I thought about the connection I feel now with friends who’ve had their lives upended; I hadn’t considered it in those terms before. With friends who’ve been lucky enough to have avoided a major loss, a divorce, a brush with death, or any other “life before” and “life after” catastrophe, I keep the conversation light, the same way my friends who experienced tragedy before me used to do with me. That we would all one day be on the level, as France described it, was perversely reassuring. Even if it were possible to stay young and carefree forever, it would mean missing out on the kind of spiritual growth that comes only from passing through pain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq7591y001x3b78157kwj1r@published" data-word-count="170"&gt;While I see France as sort of an idealized older version of myself, I’ve never been delusional enough to even aspire to be like Genevieve “Genny” Kapuler, who should be pictured under &lt;em&gt;older and wiser&lt;/em&gt; in the dictionary. I met her in my 20s, when I spent a lot of time doing alignment-based Iyengar yoga, the best kind for people, like me, who have scoliosis. When I got a six-figure book deal at 28, the first thing I did was enroll in yoga-teacher training (grad school for the especially feckless). I was fascinated by Kapuler, who is now in her late 70s and still guiding several classes a week. She has always seemed like the happiest, most youthful-spirited older person I’ve ever met. At an age when most people who do physical work are retired, she’s still bounding around the room with the energy of a teenager. During her classes, held in her enormous Soho loft (thrilling), she would adjust my postures with a gentle touch that felt like magic.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq7593e001y3b78ec7grp2p@published" data-word-count="238"&gt;Kapuler has never been terribly concerned with her aging body. “I would say physically my joints are stiffer. There’s a lot of poses I can’t do,” she told me. “I don’t do drop backs anymore.” (She means backbends that start from a standing position and end with one’s hands on the floor, spine arched into full wheel pose.) “I don’t want to hurt myself.” But in terms of her “perception,” she said, “that which I love, that which I find beautiful, that which gives me more inspiration — that gets stronger every day.” Kapuler also doesn’t romanticize youth. “I didn’t feel that being young was so easy,” she said. Her 30s and 40s were full of joy — the birth of her son, her beginnings as a teacher — but also full of sadness with the deaths of her parents and the ineludible challenges of raising a child. On the whole, she’s much more at peace now that she’s older. “I’m not being Pollyanna about it,” she said. “I accept how complex and difficult it is to be a human being in this world. But on the other hand, if I stay focused on that which I feel is worthy of my attention, I am content.” Talking to her makes me feel as though, if I focus on the aspects of life that I love, the way she does, I have a chance at the enlightenment she radiates.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq7594p001z3b78mvys26bi@published" data-word-count="262"&gt;Joyce Maynard, the 72-year-old memoirist and novelist, is another older person who has continued to work steadily, teaching and writing and publishing books. Despite, or maybe as a reaction to, a difficult childhood and the mixed impact of early fame, she’s a constitutional optimist. She’s also preternaturally vigorous and energetic, which she chalks up to good luck and good genes. When we spoke recently, she was about to take a cross-country camping trip with her boyfriend. “I’ll name my energy as a crucial aspect of what has gotten me through difficult things in life,” she said. “But that said, I also hugely believe it has to do with one’s attitude and approach. And I’ve witnessed this in countless women.” She runs a memoir-writing retreat workshop for women in Central America, which keeps her in touch with younger people, and she  said she’s continually learning new things. “I’ve had the great privilege of hearing and helping to shape many, many women’s stories, often stories that were very private and personal to them. It’s definitely expanded my understanding of the world and all the different things that happen in people’s lives.” In her later career, she’s experienced a newfound sense of freedom. When she was my age, she told me, “I gave myself over to my children. I did my career with whatever was left of me after taking care of everybody else, which I think was a story for a lot of women.” Now that her children are well launched into the world, she’s focusing on teaching and writing with a new vitality.&lt;/p&gt;

What do I want?&lt;/em&gt;” She said she knew her vigor couldn’t last forever. “Obviously, something’s going to get me, but until it does I’m going to keep going.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmiq7597h00213b78viglubwy@published" data-word-count="160"&gt;For Kim, Genny, and Joyce, 44 was the beginning of an exciting, albeit exacting, new phase of life. Staying young is in some part a matter of appreciating the opportunity to get old. It also requires being grateful for what you have while you have it — however limited it might seem compared to the past. If I’m lucky, I’ll look back on 44 and reminisce about how youthful I was then; how much fun it was to lead a rough-and-tumble life with my husband and our two irrepressible kids, how I could still get hit on by bodega guys if I wore heels and eyeliner. But I have plenty to look forward to (besides plantar fasciitis). “Forty-four years and my life is still / trying to get up that great big hill of hope,” I sang at my party. Maybe the ground is about to drop, but I’m setting my sights on singing “88 years and my life is still …”&lt;/p&gt;

Among dietitians on Instagram, doctors on TikTok and “real people” sharing their experiences, it’s not hard to discover someone who’s trying to push a habit, pill, catchy motto or health suggestion into the world. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since “health” advice is commonplace, often comes with an ulterior motive and is found on the Internet (where, let’s be real, you can’t always trust it), it’s important to be able to decipher what habits are &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; healthy versus myths shared in an attempt for views. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Further, and unfortunately, many of the health habits you’ve heard recently are on the “naughty” side, according to the experts interviewed by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ahead, various types of doctors, dietitians, therapists and other experts dive into common, recent advice that sounds healthy but actually isn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Eating only when hunger strikes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one is especially relevant now in the age of &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/side-effects-ozempic-wegovy-glp-1_l_68dfc95ee4b0dbcd325f1c9f" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="GLP-1s" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692f3f93e4b017c8f3faad6a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="68dfc95ee4b0dbcd325f1c9f" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;GLP-1s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Many factors influence hunger and fullness cues: mood, anxiety, medications and more,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutritionwithn.com/about/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Nikki Fata" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692f3f93e4b017c8f3faad6a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nutritionwithn.com/about/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nikki Fata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a registered dietitian. “Waiting to eat only when you feel hungry can often lead to inadequate food intake throughout the day, which may result in irregular or chaotic evening eating, or even unmet nutritional needs and malnutrition.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is also important to keep in mind when you know you won’t be able to eat during your regular lunch period, for example. You might want to eat more before, even if you’re not hungry, so your body has the nutrients to get through that period. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Otherwise, Fata said, you’re risking low energy levels, fatigue, moodiness, difficulty concentrating and even gastrointestinal distress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She recommended eating every two to three hours with consistent meals and snacks. “Your body has nutritional needs, whether or not you feel a hunger cue.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.

Over-pathologizing ourselves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Has self-improvement culture gone too far? Some therapists think so. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s great that people are becoming more aware of mental health, but sometimes we take that awareness too far, constantly overanalyzing every thought or feeling until we start believing something must be ‘wrong’ with us,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/2292770/amelia-kelley-phd/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Amelia Kelley" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692f3f93e4b017c8f3faad6a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/2292770/amelia-kelley-phd/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amelia Kelley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a trauma-informed therapist, author, podcaster and researcher. “When we spend too much time looking inward with a critical eye, we lose perspective and compassion for who we really are.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Further, she said, trying to “fix” ourselves is like endlessly running on a “self-improvement treadmill” or trying to grab every piece of “mental health laundry.” It’s exhausting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Sometimes it’s OK to just stop running and realize we’re already doing enough,” Kelley continued. “It’s about finding what actually supports our healing and letting the rest go.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She recommended focusing on self-compassion, curiosity, mindfulness, slowing down and noticing what helps you reconnect. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Sometimes, the healthiest thing we can do is simply let ourselves be,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Eating the protein version of everything.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Protein is a vital macronutrient that turns food into energy and even helps clear bacteria. But again, more is not always better — even when it comes to “good” things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“While protein is important, obsession isn’t health,” Simmons said. “A better way: Nourish with balance to include carbs, fats, starch, fiber and protein.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: WhiteTea via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;WhiteTea via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;A hyperfocus on protein may be doing you more harm than good.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.

What foods have them? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Probiotics are naturally found in fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, kimchi and sauerkraut,” she said. “You’ll want to look for ‘live cultures’ on the food label you’re looking at.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Second, prebiotics. “Prebiotics come from fiber-rich foods like oats, beans, legumes and nuts, and you’ll get the most benefit from these foods in your regular diet,” Sublett said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. Not using sunscreen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You may have seen an influencer or two warn about using sunscreen, saying it’s best avoided (or at least the ones with certain chemicals are). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-den-md-178680190/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Robert Den" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692f3f93e4b017c8f3faad6a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-den-md-178680190/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="18"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Robert Den&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a radiation oncologist and chief medical officer at Alpha Tau Medical, this “hot” tip is a no-no.

The reimplementation of masks represents the most significant revival of a &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/latest/covid-19"&gt;pandemic-era protocol since COVID-19 restrictions were lifted&lt;/a&gt;. Officials stress that this move is preventative, designed to alleviate strain on hospitals already burdened with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several regions, &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/world-news"&gt;including Aragón and Andalucía, have already started recommending or enforcing mask usage&lt;/a&gt; in hospitals and nursing homes. &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/us-news/159768/americans-react-mask-mandates-eight-states"&gt;The Health Ministry is now set to roll out a standardized protocol across all 17 autonomous communities&lt;/a&gt;. While the rules will be uniform, regions will have the flexibility to tweak measures based on local infection rates, hospital capacity, and flu prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the forthcoming guidelines, masks will be compulsory for patients, visitors, and staff in hospitals, primary care centers, and residential care facilities in high-risk areas, &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/entire-european-country-brings-back-36343221" rel="nofollow"&gt;reports the Daily Star.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facilities treating immunocompromised patients and nursing homes will be given priority due to the elevated risk of severe complications. While masks are still strongly recommended for individuals with symptoms, the elderly, and those with chronic conditions outside of healthcare settings, they won't be mandatory unless local authorities raise their alert level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For expats residing in Spain, this reintroduction of mask mandates in medical facilities means they'll need to have face coverings on hand when visiting hospitals, clinics, or nursing homes. Given that regional authorities may enforce rules differently, expats are encouraged to stay informed by checking updates from both national and regional health services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain is also ramping up its flu vaccination drive. Senior citizens, healthcare professionals, and individuals with underlying health issues are being urged to get their flu shots as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials maintain that a combination of vaccination, mask-wearing, hand hygiene, and proper ventilation is the most effective strategy to curb transmission, hospital admissions, and severe cases. They emphasize that self-isolating when ill remains crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder" class="loaded"&gt;&lt;mantis-ui-widget id="mantis-recommender-wrapper" data-config="{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Don't miss&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;adsEnabled&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;leaderBoardEnabled&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/mantis-ui-widget&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Health is optimistic that early intervention will prevent hospitals from reaching capacity as flu cases increase. The national protocol is designed to be adaptable, allowing authorities to tighten or ease restrictions based on the evolving situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the reinstatement of compulsory masks in healthcare settings might seem like a regression, health officials assure that these measures are temporary and targeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They underscore that everyday life outside high-risk environments can largely proceed as normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 11:17:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>一名31岁的马拉松运动员认为自己感染了诺如病毒。她被诊断出患有3期结肠癌。- Business Insider</title><link>https://www.businessinsider.com/marathon-runner-stage-3-colon-cancer-no-symptoms-2025-12</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="post-body-content post-story-body-content" data-component-type="post-body-content" data-load-strategy="exclude" data-track-content="" data-post-type="story" data-track-marfeel="post-body-content"&gt;
            
                &lt;p&gt;From a young age, Katelyn Jonozzo took pride in being very active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until she was 18, she practiced gymnastics 4 to 5 days a week. "I loved the discipline, I loved having a regimented schedule," Jonozzo, 31, told Business Insider. "That instilled how important health and fitness are to your lifestyle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her 20s, she gravitated toward &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-ran-my-first-marathon-advice-mistakes-2024-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;marathon running&lt;/a&gt;. A supply chain analyst, Jonozzo would regularly wake up at 4 or 5 am to lift for two hours and run before going to work. In 2024, she qualified to run the Boston Marathon. She couldn't wait to run it in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was before she felt a sudden, sharp stomach pain in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonozzo started experiencing &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-symptoms-colon-cancer-under-50s-chart-2024-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;flu-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and throwing up. She chalked it up to norovirus, which was going around at the time in her Cleveland suburb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My stomach started to get really, really bloated — I looked like I was almost pregnant," Jonozzo said. "But that was also a symptom of norovirus, so I kind of just lumped it into that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the pain got worse — stabbing sensations in her sides and nonstop vomiting — her two best friends urged her to go to the ER instead of waiting another day. Jonozzo complied,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;assuming the worst-case scenario was appendicitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an emergency surgery to remove part of her colon, she learned she had &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-misdiagnosis-young-people-ibs-gluten-allergy-symptoms-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;stage 3 colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, with secondary cancer in her abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonozzo said her training mindset helped her navigate her new reality. "I'm definitely a tunnel-vision person," she said. "I think I cried for about 30 seconds. Then, I looked back at the doctor, and I was like, 'What's the plan? What do we do?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="03e3a7f4-6529-424c-9055-37bf247b6912" data-toc-id="03e3a7f4-6529-424c-9055-37bf247b6912"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero warning signs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jonozzo said she was initially dismissed when she went to the hospital and told she might just have a stomachache or gassiness. She insisted that she had a high pain tolerance and wouldn't come in unless it was serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, she had an MRI done, which revealed a three-inch tumor on her colon — one that was about to rupture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the next 48 hours, she had an emergency colostomy that removed one-third of her colon and installed a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-colon-cancer-misdiagnosed-ibs-hemorrhoid-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colostomy bag&lt;/a&gt;. "I was just in so much shock and so much was going on that I didn't really know what was happening," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After recovering from a catatonic state for 10 days, she learned her exact diagnosis. Her doctor estimated that the tumor had been growing for about a decade, Jonozzo recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How have I been running marathons?" she said. "How have I been working out when I had a tumor on my stomach?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3e851f51-474d-47e6-86b3-9eb6036a5532" data-toc-id="3e851f51-474d-47e6-86b3-9eb6036a5532"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working out with a colostomy bag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                      Jonozzo said it took some time to get used to her colostomy bag.

              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Weeks after the surgery, Jonozzo began her &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-true-hidden-cost-price-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;chemotherapy treatments&lt;/a&gt;. At first, she stayed positive: making poster boards with affirmations to leave around her house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It still didn't really ever sink in, the journey that I was about to go through, until I would say probably around three or four of chemo," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By that point, she started to lose her hair and taste, experience skin changes, and develop neuropathy, losing sensations in her hands and feet. "That's when I realized, 'Ok, you have cancer. This is not just something that we're going to duck our head down and go through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One challenge was working out. During treatment, her usual routine was out of the question. "I definitely had to tone everything down," she said. She swapped long training runs and weightlifting for &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-spending-more-time-outside-is-healthy-2017-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;outdoor walks&lt;/a&gt; and three-mile jogs.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      Jonozzo said outdoor walks and being in nature helped her stay positive during treatment.
                      
              &lt;span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name="image-source" itemprop="creditText"&gt;
              
              Katelyn Jonozzo
              
              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest obstacle was the colostomy bag. "I was obviously super self-conscious about the bag in the beginning," she said. But as she started to connect with other young cancer patients through &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://touchedbycancer.org/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;The Gathering Place&lt;/a&gt; support group and the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://colorectalcancer.org/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Colorectal Cancer Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, she began to embrace the bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would go to the pool in a bathing suit, with the bag out, or I would lift my shirt up at the gym and let people know that the bag was there, which I guess made me just gain confidence," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking for the positives helped her keep up her normal routine as much as she could. "I think it's amazing that they found out how to pull your intestine out and you could still go to the bathroom," she said. "It's a great contraption, if you ask me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dd63d57b-8da9-4e0f-bdd8-a772a4b47432" data-toc-id="dd63d57b-8da9-4e0f-bdd8-a772a4b47432"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She's running a marathon with her cancer support group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After seven months of treatment, Jonozzo was deemed cancer-free. She finished chemotherapy in August and had a colostomy reversal in November. In mid-December, her first screening since finishing treatment, she'll learn more about her future screening schedule, which she already knows will include &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-symptoms-in-my-30s-colonoscopy-cost-insurance-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;two colonoscopies&lt;/a&gt; a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She'll also be officially cleared to work out after her surgery — and is eager to go back to her old routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm a little nervous just because normally I can just pop out and run and do those things, but I have to take baby steps back into it," she said. She plans to run three marathons in 2026, with the hopes of re-qualifying for Boston through one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's especially excited for the Cleveland Marathon in May. She'll run it as the team captain for her cancer fundraising group, which she said awakened new passions in her. "I love advocating, I love talking to people," she said. "I've always loved doing that — I just didn't have the confidence to do so before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's just one of the ways that her &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/young-cancer-work-career-impact-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cancer experience&lt;/a&gt; changed her, she said, along with becoming more present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People think I'm crazy for saying this, but I truly believe it was one of the best things that ever happened to me," she said. "I would not trade this experience for anything. I really wouldn't."&lt;/p&gt;

Australian doctors from the Sydney Children's Hospitals Network arrived in the PNG capital, Port Moresby, on the morning of Thursday, Dec. 4, to assist with the transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Per the outlet, the boys are joined at the lower abdomen and share a single liver and parts of their gastrointestinal tract. Tom, the smaller twin, also has a congenital heart defect and only one kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Moving the twins was initially cautioned against, according to ABC, but after weeks of tense negotiations, the move was agreed upon, and the boys are expected to undergo highly complex surgery after they arrive in Sydney at the Sydney Children's Hospitals Network facility at Westmead. The move has been “fast-tracked” due to a deterioration in Tom’s health, the outlet reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Milnes/Alamy Stock Photo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Children's Hospital at Westmead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Polapoi Chalau, the chief executive of Paradise Private Hospital in Port Moresby, where the twins were being treated, said the situation had reached a “critical level,” per ABC. “Something needs to be done," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the Australian team of doctors, Tom’s chances of long-term survival are “unlikely” given his “multiple congenital anomalies,” however, they said that Sawong had a “reasonable chance of survival” after surgery, as noted by ABC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The letter continued: “The reason for the early separation is that Sawong is working hard to support Tom. This is also why the team has recommended transfer as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Their treatment will be undertaken by a “multidisciplinary team including liver surgeons, colorectal surgeons, and urologists.” The separation itself will be carried out by specialised cardiac anaesthetists, cardiologists, neonatologists, and interventional radiologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;ABC reports that Tom and Sawong's parents have written to the PNG Government requesting funding for the complex medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The decision to move the twins follows doctors in PNG initially advising against sending them overseas for treatment, with Dr Kone Sobi, Medical director of the Port Moresby General Hospital, saying their chances of surviving the transfer were “very, very slim,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/pacific/578016/conjoined-twins-in-papua-new-guinea-have-a-will-to-live-but-face-uncertain-future" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Radio New Zealand;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Radio New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. “The prognosis is extremely bad,” he added to the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Jürgen Ruh, the helicopter pilot and sponsor who initially flew the newborns to Port Moresby, said the boys’ parents are “desperate” to do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"They are aware that one or both could be lost during the operation, but they just feel that at least they tried," Ruh said, as noted by RNZ, which also reports that there was some discussion of the twins being flown to Germany to be separated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As reported by Papua New Guinea newspaper &lt;a href="https://www.thenational.com.pg/hope-as-twins-journey-continues/?fbclid=IwY2xjawOeOttleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETE4TEZnSkxPTzJFT1ZwTGhQc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHkoLLvqXdGHXNiXGKnmxMpGV1p7zQvPDh5sE_d-M92kCIHBErjjU5A8FX30q_aem_VMqxEneGONINjtUv4L5iZA" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The National,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;The National, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;the boys were born on Oct. 9 at the Braun Hospital in Finschhafen, Morobe.

Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/covid-shot-access-coverage-at-stake-as-rfk-jrs-vaccine-panel-meets-.html"&gt;vaccine committee&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-12-01-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;scheduled to vote&lt;/a&gt; Thursday on whether to change a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/24/how-to-get-covid-mmrv-hepatitisb-vaccines.html"&gt;longstanding recommendation&lt;/a&gt; that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unclear if the panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, will significantly delay or eliminate that so-called birth dose of the shot entirely. The group&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/rfk-jrs-vaccine-panel-postpones-vote-on-hepatitis-b-shot-for-babies.html"&gt; tabled a vote &lt;/a&gt;on the vaccine in September because some members called for a more robust discussion first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But either change could have wide-ranging consequences: Some public health experts say that having fewer newborns vaccinated against the virus could risk an increase in chronic infections among children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. There is no cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a vaccine that is highly effective at preventing an incurable disease. We should take full advantage of that," Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The birth dose recommendation was introduced in 1991 and is credited with &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00333549231175548" target="_blank"&gt;driving down infections in kids by 99%&lt;/a&gt; since then. Maniar called that a "remarkable success story that we run the risk of reversing" if the committee changes the recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decisions by the panel are not legally binding, as it is &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/a-look-at-recent-changes-to-state-vaccine-requirements-for-school-children/" target="_blank"&gt;up to states&lt;/a&gt; to mandate immunizations. But ACIP's recommendations have significant implications for whether private insurance plans and government assistance programs cover the vaccines at no cost for eligible children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel's upcoming two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy earlier this year gutted the committee and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/11/rfk-jr-malone-cdc-vaccine-committee.html"&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. During the meeting in September, some advisors raised questions about whether the benefits of the shot outweigh potential safety risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the jab is "an incredibly safe vaccine with minimal risks," Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, said during a media briefing Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine," said O'Leary, who practiced for eight years as a general pediatrician and worked in a newborn nursery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AAP, which publishes its own vaccine schedule, &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;still recommends&lt;/a&gt; the universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine because "it saves lives," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project/hepatitis-b" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, published Tuesday, of more than 400 studies spanning four decades also found no evidence that delaying the universal hepatitis B vaccine birth dose improves safety or effectiveness. The review also found that the birth dose does not cause any short- or long-term serious adverse events or deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;CDC study&lt;/a&gt; showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MRK/"&gt;Merck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GSK/"&gt;GSK&lt;/a&gt; manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Merck during the panel's September meeting pushed back on changing the recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reconsideration of the newborn Hepatitis B vaccination on the established schedule poses a grave risk to the health of children and to the public, which could lead to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases," Dr. Richard Haupt, Merck's head of global medical and scientific affairs for vaccines and infectious diseases, said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 10:00:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOY3ZHTS1jTXMwRnY3TnpFSmJScmhwN3djcWVtaFFoWU1JaHdSU3RtRnExdFJacnYtZlNudU1abVFVb2xEN1NxdmVyX1VCdHdncVQxcTFrdUUwZEZNSG9ZR3RJV1pENDFpVmNqQ3ZCRTAzX2o3Q283TmZ6U1pIcDAteNIBhgFBVV95cUxOV0pkckF3d2ZGODd1WVFUbjU4R3ltVjNZTFpIYlEzdW5MbXlMT2JYb3h4cmxQVGdVbUVBV1VQWUt1RTBRa3dMemJGU014STJ2OTNKWW9OYVRkWVZRUlV0bkhxREhsYWhNQkRXWUk3M3dscExVcTh5VHR0RzN6bXJrX2pON3ZUUQ</guid></item><item><title>毒品夺走了她的儿子和腿。现在， Kelly Wyatt致力于保持清醒。- Inquirer.com</title><link>https://www.inquirer.com/health/a/tranq-wound-recovery-amputation-philadelphia-fentanyl-crisis-20251204.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="type-body-text"&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Kelly Wyatt winced as a nurse unwrapped layers of gauze from her left leg, exposing the massive wound beneath. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Yellow and red and gray, weeping plasma and agonizingly painful at the slightest touch, it covered almost the entirety of the end of her leg — the site of the amputation she had undergone four years before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Emergency room doctors at the time had warned her that if the drugs she was using didn’t kill her, her wounds would. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Now Wyatt is 14 months into recovery from an addiction to fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, and xylazine, an animal tranquilizer never approved for human use. The emergence of xylazine, known as “tranq” on the streets, early in the decade marked the beginning of a dangerous new era for Philadelphians addicted to illicit opioids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Tranq users developed skin lesions that became gaping wounds, though exactly how is still unclear. As the medical establishment scrambled to respond, &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/a/tranq-drug-wounds-amputation-xylazine-philadelphia-20250422.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.inquirer.com/health/a/tranq-drug-wounds-amputation-xylazine-philadelphia-20250422.html"&gt;amputations more than doubled among people addicted to opioids&lt;/a&gt; between 2019 and 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Wyatt, 52, is among hundreds of Philadelphians facing lifelong medical needs from tranq, as the latest wave of the area’s drug crisis has seen a rapidly evolving succession of veterinary and industrial chemicals compound the dangers of the powerful opioids being sold on the streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Some have become regular patients in burn units and wound care clinics at area hospitals, among the only places capable of treating severe tranq injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;As part of its ongoing &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/opioid-addiction/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.inquirer.com/health/opioid-addiction/"&gt;coverage of the area’s drug crisis&lt;/a&gt;, The Inquirer followed Wyatt for more than a year as she went through early recovery and worked with doctors to heal her wound. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Wyatt initially shrugged when the small sores had emerged on her legs, only to watch them grow into massive abscesses, resulting in an amputation below her knee. Her ongoing tranq use prevented the wound on her left leg from healing properly. Even after recent months of sobriety and careful treatment, doctors are still warning her that they may have to amputate more of her leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;But Wyatt’s tranq wounds go still deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Over the last several years, both of her sons had spiraled into addiction. By January, both of them were dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Several members of Wyatt’s family have struggled with addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Wyatt experimented with drugs as a teenager, but was sober during her kids’ early childhoods. She didn’t drink alcohol, let alone seek out illicit drugs, after giving birth to her eldest son, Dakota, at 18. She raised two sons and a daughter in a neighborhood near Pennypack Park.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Her days had a familiar rhythm: packing lunches, picking the kids up from school, watching them play together at the local park. In her spare time, she dabbled in mixed-media art, designing the window displays at the downtown restaurant where she worked for years. One Philadelphia Flower Show-themed display had a working waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Her youngest, Tyler, was a happy child, grinning wide in every school picture and sharing inside jokes and a love for music with his brother. Dakota, more sensitive, had struggled with anxiety from an early age; Wyatt remembers him asking her at bedtime what the family would do if their house burned down in the night. But he could always make her laugh, and she and the boys would sing along to the same music in the car: ’90s alt-rock, Johnny Cash, the local hip-hop station. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;In 1999, she divorced their father. A few years later, at 28, she took her first Percocet pill, an opioid painkiller approved for medical use that is widely abused as a street drug.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;She had just started working at a bar, and the long hours were wearing on her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;With the pills, “I could get more cleaning done, I could push my body more,” she said. “And it snowballed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;She was not aware when her sons began using drugs themselves in their teenage years. “I didn’t know for a long, long time,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Afterward, Wyatt  tried to help them seek treatment, even while her own drug use increased, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;But a series of traumatic life events resulted in all falling deeper into addiction together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Wyatt’s ex-husband died following long-standing health issues, including diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Then Dakota, who drove a Zamboni at a local ice rink, was injured in an accident at work — losing the tips of his fingers while cleaning the machine. He had been using more opioids to deal with the pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Wyatt began buying drugs with him in Kensington, at the vast open-air drug market that is &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.inquirer.com/crime/a/kensington-philadelphia-crime-rates-drug-market-addiction-resources-20251120.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.inquirer.com/crime/a/kensington-philadelphia-crime-rates-drug-market-addiction-resources-20251120.html"&gt;the epicenter of Philadelphia’s opioid crisis&lt;/a&gt;. “It was normalizing — I’m his mom and I’m with him in that crazy environment. I’m sure it made him feel like it was OK. And I regret that,” Wyatt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;“I regret a lot of stuff. But that was the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;It was the mid-2010s, and the drugs on the street were changing. The stronger synthetic &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/health/fentanyl-synthetic-opioid-drug-overdoses-philadelphia-pennsylvania-20181024.html-2" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/health/fentanyl-synthetic-opioid-drug-overdoses-philadelphia-pennsylvania-20181024.html-2"&gt;opioid fentanyl was just emerging&lt;/a&gt;; dealers chanted “fetty-fetty-fetty” on the corners to draw in customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;And then Wyatt began hearing talk of “tranq” getting mixed into the drug supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;That was around the time that Dakota developed wounds on his arm, open sores that would not close. Wyatt found small wounds on her arms and legs — “like melon-ball scoops.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;One day, she saw a flier, handed out by health authorities in &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.inquirer.com/topic/kensington"&gt;Kensington&lt;/a&gt;, warning that tranq can cause skin lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;“All of a sudden,” she recalled, “things made sense.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;But her addiction was so severe that she was afraid to stop using the fentanyl-tranq mix now prevalent in the illicit drug market. She fixated on avoiding xylazine’s &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/opioid-addiction/xylazine-animal-sedative-fentanyl-philadelphia-20220309.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.inquirer.com/health/opioid-addiction/xylazine-animal-sedative-fentanyl-philadelphia-20220309.html"&gt;severe withdrawal symptoms&lt;/a&gt; — chills, sweating, anxiety, and agitation — which don’t respond to traditional opioid withdrawal medications. She worried about seeking treatment with no guarantee of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;By the time Wyatt was admitted to a hospital in 2021, she was hallucinating from sepsis, a severe complication from an infection that can lead to organ failure, shock, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;When she woke up eight days later, a doctor told her she was at risk of having one leg amputated, and maybe both. “Please let me keep as much of my leg as possible,” she recalls begging a doctor who wanted to remove her entire leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;“The doctor thought I should get the whole leg cut off. The other thing I could do was amputate below the knee, and then get tons of operations for the infection,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Her oldest son’s tranq wounds had also worsened. Dakota had wounds on his legs and an arm, which was eventually amputated later that year. He also suffered a heart infection linked to his drug use, and needed a valve replacement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;After a month in the hospital, he came home and continued using drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;He developed new lesions. Maggots ate at his rotting skin. Wyatt cleaned the bugs out of his wounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Wyatt tried bargaining with her son, promising they could get addiction treatment together. She offered to get him enough drugs that he wouldn’t enter withdrawal while waiting for care at the hospital. Sometimes, he managed to stay at the hospital for a few hours, but never longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;“He was too embarrassed to go anywhere, he was too afraid to get clean, and he was too afraid to be sick. He told us he would rather die than go through withdrawal again,” she said. “A couple times, he asked me if I wanted to just shoot up and lay down and die with him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;“‘I want to live,’” she recalls telling him, “‘and I don’t want to live without you.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;One night in January 2024, Dakota was having trouble breathing and seemed to be hallucinating, speaking nonsense. He asked Wyatt to call an ambulance to the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Dakota died before the family reached the hospital. His cause of death was listed as drug intoxication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Wyatt believes ongoing health issues from his wounds hastened his death. Her grief intensified her own drug use, leading to more xylazine wounds. The wound that had opened near her amputation grew worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;A month after Dakota’s death, she entered drug treatment. After three months, she relapsed and overdosed on cocaine and fentanyl. Her first thought after waking up was to use again, but instead she chose rehab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;“I didn’t want to die,” Wyatt said. “I didn’t want to be in pain anymore.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;She arrived at the Behavioral Wellness Center at Girard in July 2024, hoping to enter outpatient rehab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Instead, physicians recommended their inpatient clinic that could also treat her wounds, one of the few such facilities in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Wyatt was living there and undergoing treatment a month later, in August 2024, when she wheeled her motorized wheelchair into a clinic room and took deep breaths as nurses carefully peeled back layers of moisturized gauze on her left leg, cleaning the wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Still in the shaky early months of recovery, and needing to remain in inpatient rehab, she remained worried about Tyler, who was still using drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;“He was the primary caretaker of his brother. They would be in their room, getting high together. And now he’s just in that room by himself, day in and day out,” she said in an interview that summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;“I kept saying, ‘I think I should go home to him.’ And everybody kept saying to me, ‘You have to work on yourself first. He’ll be fine,’” she later recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;“And then he wasn’t fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Wyatt was still in rehab in January 2025 when her partner, Randy Stewart, called. He hadn’t seen Tyler in hours and thought he might have left the family’s house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Wyatt called several hospitals and then asked Randy to check the bathroom in the back of the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;He found Tyler on the floor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;“I just thought, God, please no,” Wyatt said. “Not again. You can’t do this to me again.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Tyler’s cause of death was also listed as “drug intoxication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;He died at 27, a year and 10 days after his brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Wyatt is still wracked by guilt. Guilt that she used drugs with her sons. That she used drugs at all. That she wasn’t there when either of her boys died. That her daughter, who does not use drugs, stopped speaking to her. Sometimes, she dreams about her children and wakes up screaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;As she continues treatment, Wyatt said, she hopes her story will help other families struggling with addiction, especially the realities of tranq use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;“Sometimes I’m embarrassed to talk about it. But I feel like I have to,” she said. “Because people need to know. If one person sees this and gets some medical care, gets any kind of help, I would be happy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;For Wyatt, maintaining her recovery from addiction and caring for her wounds are full-time occupations that sometimes are in conflict. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Methadone, the opioid addiction treatment drug that has helped Wyatt curb cravings for more than a year, can be dispensed only at special clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Wyatt’s clinic journey meant three hours a day on a bus where she couldn’t keep her leg elevated. The wound worsened until she was able to switch to a closer methadone clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Wyatt relies on Stewart to help her move around her home, where the only bathroom that she can access is the one where Tyler died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;“Cleaning, taking care of me, changing my wound dressings, talking about my sons — he calms me down. It’s been a lot, and he’s really done a lot,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Once a week, Wyatt travels to Jefferson Einstein Philadelphia Hospital’s Center for Wound Healing for wound care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;At a recent appointment, nurse practitioner Danielle Curran scraped away infected skin, measured the wounds, cleaned and re-bandaged her lesion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;In between office visits, nurses also go to her home to clean and re-bandage her wound twice weekly. Several times this year, Wyatt has undergone debridement surgery to remove more damaged skin under anesthesia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;If the treatments manage to shrink her wound, Curran said, Wyatt could try a skin graft and eventually receive a prosthetic leg that could help her get around more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Curran has treated about 20 xylazine patients at the clinic over the last few years. About 10, including Wyatt, are still getting regular care. Others have relapsed and returned to the streets. Several have died of overdoses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;She is relieved that, as Philadelphia’s opioid crisis continues to evolve, tranq is becoming less prevalent. But it has been replaced in street drugs by another animal tranquilizer, medetomidine, which does not appear to cause flesh wounds but, rather, &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/a/medetomidine-drug-use-withdrawal-effects-20251104.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.inquirer.com/health/a/medetomidine-drug-use-withdrawal-effects-20251104.html"&gt;agonizing withdrawal symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. Skin lesions among opioid users have decreased in the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Yet Curran still insists on seeing patients like Wyatt with xylazine wounds weekly, trying to help them through their injuries and hopefully their recovery, too. “I like to be another person holding them accountable, to stay on the path. We try to give them that support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Sometimes, that support means simply reminding Wyatt how far she has come in the four years since the amputation, and now 14 months of sobriety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;At a recent appointment, after carefully scraping dead skin away from Wyatt’s leg with a small curette, Curran walked through her next steps: A disinfecting gel to keep bacteria out of the wound. A course of antibiotics to avoid infection. Another debridement surgery, in a few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;“As a rule of thumb,” Curran told a reporter, “it’s very hard to give timelines for wound care, because of all the things that could possibly go wrong. A wound this size, though? It could take years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Wyatt began to cry. “It’s already been four years,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;Curran turned to her. “You’ve made so much progress,” she said gently. “Give yourself time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6 max-w-lf-body mx-auto"&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary inq-p--longform-v2 text-222222"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Editor’s note: This story has been updated to clarify the name of the &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.inquirer.com/topic/jefferson-health"&gt;Jefferson Health&lt;/a&gt; clinic where Kelly Wyatt received wound care.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Inquirer.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 10:00:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPd0ZzVmFCMHFwb2NlUWU3WlFabmJaaVlDakFKSW15TEZKaWU2NTFQZFVmXzNJZEZsV3VFV25KYkljSkJ4RVdnZldiX3d1M2pTYjNibVF1aHlycG02ZEZwa1ZIM0JYdmRoa3lrZktUT01EV1JCZnBZM09jVUVweGdMWkdmbkY1b1ZMMnhQTndpcjhvNnlpN1hhdlVUYnJ6OFVpZ0tVcWh1bmo5dkVl</guid></item><item><title>乙型肝炎：父母应了解的病毒和疫苗的信息- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/04/nx-s1-5629168/hepatitis-b-vaccine-kids-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                The hepatitis B virus attacks the liver. Hepatitis B has no cure, and chronic infection can lead to serious outcomes such as liver cancer, cirrhosis and death.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For more than three decades, it has been routine to give all newborns in the U.S. the hepatitis B vaccine. That could soon change.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;An advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to vote Thursday on whether to rescind that universal recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If that happens, pediatricians say, the health consequences could be dire.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It would be extremely dangerous," &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/find-a-doctor/andrew-t-pavia" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Andrew Pavia&lt;/a&gt; told NPR this year. He's a professor of pediatrics and medicine with the University of Utah and a pediatric and adult infectious disease specialist.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The hepatitis B virus &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-b/symptoms-causes/syc-20366802" target="_blank"&gt;attacks the liver&lt;/a&gt;. The disease has no cure, and chronic infection can lead to serious outcomes such as liver cancer, cirrhosis and death. And the risks of these outcomes are much higher for people who get infected as infants.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"About 25% of children who develop chronic hepatitis B will die of their infection," says Pavia, who is also a spokesperson for the &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Infectious Diseases Society of America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Delaying the birth dose by just two months could result in at least 1,400 additional preventable cases of hepatitis B for each year the revised recommendation is in place, &lt;a href="https://hepvu.org/news-updates/new-analysis-shows-delaying-the-hepatitis-b-birth-dose-may-lead-to-thousands-of-preventable-infections-and-hundreds-of-millions-in-avoidable-healthcare-costs/" target="_blank"&gt;according to a new analysis&lt;/a&gt;. Delaying the vaccine until age 12, as President &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/25/nx-s1-5553541/trump-advises-parents-on-hepatitis-b-vaccine-heres-why-doctors-say-hes-wrong" target="_blank"&gt;Trump suggested&lt;/a&gt; this year, could result in at least 2,700 preventable infections each year, the analysis found. The study was released prior to peer review, ahead of this week's meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before the U.S. began universally vaccinating newborns in 1991, some 18,000 children a year would become infected before age 10. About half were infected through mother-to-child transmission, Pavia says. Giving newborns the shot right after birth prevents the virus from taking hold.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The other half of kids got infected from somewhere else. Trump said hepatitis B is sexually transmitted — which is one means of transmission — so there's no reason to give the vaccine to a baby. But Pavia says the risks for kids are everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There have been cases of infections in day care. There have been cases of infection on sports teams. There have been documented infections from shared toothbrushes and from shared razors," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The virus is found in blood, saliva, semen and other bodily fluids, even tears, and it can live on surfaces for up to seven days. A child with a wound who comes into contact with that surface — even days later — could become infected, says &lt;a href="https://www.anitakpatelmd.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Anita Patel&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician and pediatric critical care physician in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/about/index.html#:~:text=Chronic%20hepatitis%20B%20*%20CDC%20estimates%20that,as%20the%20rate%20among%20non%2DHispanic%20White%20people." target="_blank"&gt;half of people infected with hepatitis B&lt;/a&gt; don't know they have the virus, but Patel says they can still pass on the virus unwittingly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you have a cut, that blood could potentially get on the infant," Patel says. "And if that infant has any sort of break in their skin — as infants, frankly, frequently do — they can then get hepatitis B," says Patel.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aasld.org/the-liver-meeting/speakers/su-h-wang-122984#:~:text=Biography,AASLD%20HBV%20Guidelines%20Writing%20group." target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Su Wang&lt;/a&gt; says she suspects she got infected with hepatitis B as an infant through her grandparents. She says they likely got exposed through their jobs as medical workers in Taiwan. Taiwan used to have very high rates of hepatitis B infection among adults before it began a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7472725/#:~:text=The%20vaccine%20program%20has%20been,abdominal%20ultrasonography%20are%20performed%20regularly." target="_blank"&gt;successful national vaccination&lt;/a&gt; program in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"When I was born, they came over to help, like a lot of grandparents do, and they lived with us," Wang says. "They became primary caregivers for the first month of life. And so very likely that's how I got hep B."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wang is now an internist and researcher specializing in hepatitis at Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says it's very important to give the shot at birth. Since vaccination of newborns became routine in the U.S., case rates have plummeted 99% among people age 19 and younger.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When we started doing this as universal for all kids, you saw this blanket protection that protected an entire generation of kids," Wang says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Many identify global upheavals as the source of the surge in mental illness — Covid-19, social media, climate anxiety. Others ask if the epidemic is a mirage, arguing that we are medicalizing everyday stress and sadness that are part of the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These questions matter. Mental health services are under extraordinary strain. I’m based in the U.K., where &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/mental-health-waiting-list-nhs-depression-community-care-b2772202.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;long NHS waiting lists grab the headlines&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s far from a local issue. In the U.S &lt;a href="https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-by-the-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;16.5% of youths&lt;/a&gt; between the ages of 6 and 17 experienced a mental health disorder in the past year. Just &lt;a href="https://www.projecthope.org/news-stories/story/the-global-mental-health-crisis-10-numbers-to-note/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;9% of people with depression globally receive adequate treatment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Behind those statistics are people suffering, some severely. Regardless of whether you believe the overall rise in diagnoses reflects reality or overreach, it’s hard to deny that many people need urgent help from systems that are struggling to provide it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, focusing on who “counts” as mentally ill ultimately sends us down the wrong path. It frames the issue as binary — ill or not ill — when the reality is far more complex. What we urgently need is not a narrowing of definitions but a smarter, more personalized approach to finding the right solution for the right person at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right now, hugely diverse groups of people are funneled into a limited set of treatment paths, despite the enormous variation in their experiences, and even greater differences in how they respond to treatment. It’s like looking at the full spectrum of a rainbow and responding as if we see only red, yellow, and blue.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Imagine if we could match individuals to the solutions most likely to work for them, based on their specific needs and characteristics. We’d treat people faster, reduce waiting lists, and prevent conditions from escalating. We’d also identify who could benefit from lower-resource support and move through treatment quickly, who needs urgent intervention, and how to improve early-stage care to stop problems before they become acute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Opening up our perspective can also allow us to think beyond “treatment.” For some people, the most effective way to improve their mental health is not through clinical interventions but through policy changes, community initiatives, or strategies that tackle an individual’s needs holistically. For example, Wellcome funds research that tests innovative approaches both inside and outside traditional health care settings, ranging from use of &lt;a href="https://wellcome.org/insights/articles/avatar-digital-therapy-could-help-people-who-hear-voices" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;digital avatars&lt;/a&gt; with support from clinicians to help those who experience distressing voices, to the use of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c93127z99yxo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;group singing&lt;/a&gt; to help address some cases of postpartum depression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we reframe the challenge this way, we can move the debate beyond a sole focus on health care systems, which are often gated and resource-limited. It creates possibilities for prevention, social support, and structural changes that can reduce risk and promote mental health at scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This still requires innovation within health care, but by broadening our lens, we can design solutions that meet people where they are, rather than forcing everyone through the same bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a pipe dream. Scientists are making progress toward identifying new solutions that are set to revolutionize mental health care within the next five years. In 2024, the Food and Drug Administration approved the &lt;a href="https://wellcome.org/insights/articles/new-treatment-for-schizophrenia-Cobenfy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;first new approach &lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://wellcome.org/insights/articles/new-treatment-for-schizophrenia-Cobenfy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; in decades. Research funded by Wellcome is underway to understand why different people respond differently to the same medications, so we can predict who will benefit from which antidepressant, for example. Researchers are also analyzing the effects of social initiatives and community support —ranging from social prescribing to broader policy changes — on different groups with mental health problems.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other studies are exploring how to personalize talking therapies, sleep interventions, exercise, or nutrition based on factors like genetics, learning style, or past experience. There’s also work to identify cohorts whose mental health challenges may stem from specific biological issues — such as inflammation or sensitivity to changes in light — so solutions can target these root causes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The temptation, given the scale of the current mental health challenge, is to conclude that the answer lies in declaring much of it illusory, that a substantial proportion of people simply don’t need intervention. And yes, mental health science must always respect the boundary between treatable conditions and the ordinary ups and downs of life.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But dismissing the current crisis won’t make it go away. Instead, we should rise to it, recognizing that different people need different types of support, and for some this may involve self-care or require other wider societal change. Using cutting-edge science can help find effective solutions that can then be delivered rapidly, equitably, and at scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach would transform mental health care. It would stop problems at the earliest point, preventing them from becoming chronic or recurrent. It would help people return to rewarding family, social, and professional lives. And it would move us beyond the sterile debate about overdiagnosis toward a future where mental health care is as precise and personalized as any other branch of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The question isn’t whether too many people are being diagnosed. It’s whether we’re willing to invest in the science and systems that can ensure every person gets the solutions they truly need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miranda Wolpert is director of mental health at Wellcome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Since WHO approved the world's first malaria vaccines in 2021, 24 countries have introduced the vaccines into their routine immunization programmes. Seasonal malaria chemoprevention has also been expanded and is now being implemented in 20 countries, reaching 54 million children in 2024, an increase from about 0.2 million in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress is also being made in eliminating malaria. To date, a total of 47 countries and 1 territory have been certified malaria-free by WHO – Cabo Verde and Egypt were certified malaria-free in 2024, and Georgia, Suriname, and Timor-Leste joined them in 2025. Despite this significant progress, there were an estimated 282 million malaria cases and 610 000 deaths in 2024 – roughly 9 million more cases than the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 95% of these deaths were in the WHO African Region, with most occurring among children under 5. The report shows that antimalarial drug resistance is growing and stands in the way of achieving malaria elimination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"New tools for prevention of malaria are giving us new hope, but we still face significant challenges," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "Increasing numbers of cases and deaths, the growing threat of drug resistance and the impact of funding cuts all threaten to roll back the progress we have made over the past two decades. However, none of these challenges is insurmountable. With the leadership of the most-affected countries and targeted investment, the vision of a malaria-free world remains achievable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;World malaria report &lt;/em&gt;spotlights evidence on partial resistance to artemisinin derivatives, which became the backbone of malaria treatments after failures of chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Antimalarial drug resistance has now been confirmed or suspected in at least 8 countries in Africa, and there are potential signs of declining efficacy of the drugs that are combined with artemisinin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress in reducing the malaria deaths – a key target of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240031357"&gt;Global technical strategy for malaria 2016-2030&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – remains far off track. In 2024, there were 610 000 deaths. This corresponds to 13.8 malaria deaths per 100 000 population, more than 3 times the global target of 4.5 deaths per 100 000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Complex challenges to progress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s report underscores a growing array of risks to malaria elimination efforts in addition to the threat of antimalarial drug resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malaria parasites with &lt;em&gt;pfhrp2&lt;/em&gt; gene deletions remain prevalent, undermining the reliability of rapid diagnostic tests, while confirmed pyrethroid resistance in 48 countries is reducing the effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets. At the same time, &lt;em&gt;Anopheles stephensi&lt;/em&gt; mosquitoes – resistant to many commonly used insecticides – have now invaded 9 African countries, posing a serious challenge to urban malaria control efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond biological threats, extreme weather events are also contributing to increased outbreaks of malaria. Changes in temperature and rainfall are altering habitats for mosquitoes and thus transmission patterns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conflict and instability in affected regions are also leading to widespread disruptions of health services, limiting access to care and delaying timely diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge is further exacerbated by the plateauing of global funding over the last decade limiting the reach of life-saving interventions. In 2024, US$3.9 billion was invested in the malaria response, yet it reached less than half of the 2025 funding target of US$9.3 billion set by the Global technical strategy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent reductions in Official Development Assistance (ODA) have severely disrupted health systems, weakening routine surveillance and forcing the cancellation or postponement of most planned malaria surveys. These cuts have also heightened the risk of stock-outs and delays in malaria interventions campaigns, undermining programme impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Country led, partner enabled response&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The World Malaria Report is clear: drug resistance is advancing. Our response must be equally clear – new medicines with new mechanisms of action,” said Dr Martin Fitchet CEO of Medicines for Malaria Venture. “The development of the first non-artemisinin combination therapy, Ganaplacide–Lumefantrine, is proof that this is possible, and it represents the beginning of a new chapter in malaria resilience. Together with a global partnership of expertise, commitment and funding, we can stay ahead of resistance and deliver new medicines to ensure malaria is no longer a threat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Political commitments need to be translated into resources and actions with sustainable and equitable impact. WHO urges malaria-endemic countries to maintain their political commitments to ending malaria deaths as outlined in the Yaoundé Declaration. Unity and action under the Big Push initiative will help global malaria community mitigate current and future threats to achieve a malaria-free future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Previous research suggests that these molecules may possess anticancer properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2025 study, laboratory experiments on human colon cells (both healthy and cancerous) and in mice, propionate and butyrate were able to alter genes that regulate the differentiation and multiplication of cells, as well as genes controlling programmed cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebnem-Unluisler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Şebnem Ünlüişler&lt;/a&gt;, genetic engineer and Chief Longevity Officer at the London Regenerative Institute, who was not involved in the study, explained to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The research focuses on short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like propionate and butyrate, which are produced when gut bacteria break down dietary fiber. These SCFAs can influence the activity of both cancer-promoting (proto-oncogenes) and cancer-suppressing (tumor-suppressor) genes by modifying histones, the proteins that help package DNA. By making the DNA more accessible, SCFAs can turn certain genes on or off, depending on the cell type and conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has shown that butyrate inhibits enzymes known as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383523000345" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;histone deacetylases (HDACs)&lt;/a&gt;, which can result in changes that slow tumor cell growth or even trigger their death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, while it is still advisable to eat plenty of fiber-rich foods, it is important to note that this was a cell-and animal-based study.

Therefore, interpreting the results is not straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that milk may support a healthier, more diverse gut microbiome, while cheese might have the opposite effect. However, it is important to note the small sample size, self-reported data, and predominantly older male cohort in the study. More research is necessary before issuing broad dietary guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521691823000069" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has highlighted that the food people consume is one of the most significant influences on the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A large-scale study of over 21,000 people in the U.S., U.K. and Italy, published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41564-024-01870-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vegan-vegetarian-omnivore-diet-type-quality-gut-health" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;quality and diversity of the diet&lt;/a&gt; — rather than the dietary pattern itself — has the biggest impact on the structure of the gut microbiome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omnivore dietary patterns generally showed greater overall bacterial diversity, but also had higher abundances of bacteria associated with meat digestion and conditions like IBD and colorectal cancer. However, the presence of these bacteria does not necessarily mean a person will develop disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, vegan and vegetarian dietary patterns typically had higher levels of gut microbes linked with fiber fermentation, especially bacteria that produce SCFAs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the research notes that people following an omnivorous eating plan that consumed plenty of diverse, high-fiber plant foods, such as fiber-rich vegetables and whole grains, also had elevated levels of beneficial microbes, comparable to those seen in vegan and vegetarian dietary patterns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://webapps.unitn.it/du/it/Persona/PER0019081/Curriculum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nicola Segata&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, professor and principal investigator at the Department of Cellular, Computational, and Integrative Biology (CIBIO) at Università di Trento in Italy, is the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segata is also on the advisory board and a consultant for the personalized nutrition program company ZOE Limited, who partly funded the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The greater the variety of plant-based foods we consume, the greater the diversity of beneficial microbes in our gut. This is because different plant-based foods contain different types of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/146935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, and each fiber can stimulate the growth of different types of health-promoting microbes. These microbes work together to improve our gut health, so the more diversity of health-associated microbes in our gut microbiome, the better our chances of good gut health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MedicalNewsToday</author><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 06:17:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxOaDFlVl9pTi01QWsyQWhmMzRyT2xaTkw4SE9BSTNHMm5ObE9PaGFGd1FwS2tVQ0UtM0VablZJdHhvX29nOEk3c3FiVndLR3J6XzU0LWE3Q0xkeVhUNjRIN01tR2FaS2Q0UnJ3S0E3Nkx3YWFyMmc5ekJOT2pFUlZnRTNHbG5BSnUxYm1aSk5QenhYVHNSVHo2MDFDNklNdXRaWTBsNVdxcUpMV2pY</guid></item><item><title>法国确认回国旅客中有2例MERS冠状病毒病例- BNO新闻</title><link>https://bnonews.com/index.php/2025/12/france-confirms-2-mers-coronavirus-cases-in-returning-travelers/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mvp-content-main" class="left relative"&gt;
														
&lt;p&gt;Two cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been confirmed in France in individuals who recently returned from travel abroad, according to the French Ministry of Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ministry said the infections were identified after both patients developed symptoms consistent with MERS-CoV and were found to have traveled together to the Arabian Peninsula, according to &lt;a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2025/12/04/deux-cas-de-coronavirus-mers-identifies-en-france-sur-des-personnes-de-retour-de-l-etranger_6655935_3244.html"&gt;Le Monde&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health Minister Stéphanie Rist said the patients are being treated in the hospital as a precaution and that their conditions are stable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rist said measures have been implemented to limit the risk of transmission, including contact tracing, testing, isolation, and precautionary steps for anyone who may have been exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bnone-in-content-4" id="bnone-286855448"&gt;&lt;div class="advert-block"&gt;

	&lt;p data-fuse="22691751352"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ministry said no secondary transmission has been detected in France. Other individuals who took part in the same trip are being monitored.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MERS-CoV is a respiratory virus first identified in 2012 and is primarily associated with transmission from camels in countries on the Arabian Peninsula. Human-to-human spread can occur, particularly in healthcare settings, but sustained community transmission is uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus causes severe respiratory illness in many cases, with symptoms that can include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. According to the World Health Organization, MERS has a high case-fatality rate compared to other coronaviruses, with about one-third of confirmed patients dying from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Large outbreaks outside the Middle East have been rare but significant. In 2015, South Korea experienced a major hospital-associated outbreak linked to a traveler returning from the region, resulting in 186 cases and dozens of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
