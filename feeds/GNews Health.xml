On Reddit, posters &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1ixuhgl/does_life_seem_to_be_losing_its_color_to_you/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;observe&lt;/a&gt;: “As I get older it feels like life is losing its color,” and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Aging/comments/1i8gnow/are_your_colors_getting_dull/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ask&lt;/a&gt;: “Were colors brighter and more vibrant when I was younger?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Indeed, according to &lt;a href="https://lab.sciencemuseum.org.uk/colour-shape-using-computer-vision-to-explore-the-science-museum-c4b4f1cbd72c" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; from the UK’s Science Museum Group, there’s been a stark increase in gray everyday objects since the mid-20th century. But this dullification may go beyond the modern preponderance of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/28/everything-in-our-world-is-grey-how-did-we-come-to-this" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ashen cars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/09/the-sad-beige-aesthetic-why-has-the-world-suddenly-turned-taupe" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;sad beige nurseries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/what-is-millennial-gray-8667084" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;millennial gray apartments&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists believe that color perception itself can fade, altering how the world appears. Depending on how your eyes – and brain – age, the bright red balloon you remember from your seventh birthday party might not look as vivid if you came across it again at 93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"wellness","tags":[{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"wellness/series/the-joys-of-aging","type":"Series","title":"The joys of ageing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","type":"Keyword","title":"Health &amp;amp; wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/adrienne-matei","type":"Contributor","title":"Adrienne Matei","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/10/21/Adrienne_Matei.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=9ee51ef2fe3b53e603b2774c3b8cf1be"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle-and-wellness","type":"Tracking","title":"US lifestyle and wellness"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"wellness/2025/aug/06/ageing-color-perception","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Changes in color perception can occur for several reasons. One common factor is structural shifts in the eye. For instance, a cataract – a condition that clouds the eye’s lens – can gradually tint vision with a yellow-brown “brunescent” hue. In the US, about &lt;a href="https://eye.ufl.edu/2024/10/02/are-you-one-of-the-millions-about-to-have-cataract-surgery-heres-what-ophthalmologists-say-you-need-to-know/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;4m&lt;/a&gt; cataract surgeries are performed annually. A brunescent lens “can pull the blue and green out” of the world around us, says Dr Andrew Iwach of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. After a cataract is removed, the difference in color clarity afterward can be so striking that Iwach wears a bright blue tie to delight his recovering patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="61573f8e-ceb4-4641-a94b-bd4ec20c596a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Why it’s important to protect your hearing as you age – and what experts suggest","elementId":"61573f8e-ceb4-4641-a94b-bd4ec20c596a","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jul/30/hearing-loss-clarity-cognitive-decline-isolation"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Changes in color perception can also be caused by glaucoma or macular degeneration. Iwach recommends &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/salud-ocular/consejos/eye-exams-101" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;routine eye exams&lt;/a&gt;, and says if you notice this type of change, see an ophthalmologist. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/sep/05/treating-eyesight-issues-could-prevent-one-in-five-dementia-cases-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Research from 2024&lt;/a&gt; found that up to 15% of global dementia cases could be linked to problems with color perception issues, meaning that an eye exam can be an important step in screening and mitigating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some medications can also affect color perception, says Iwach – namely Viagra (pilots are &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/ame_guide/pharm/ed" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;required&lt;/a&gt; to abstain from the drug eight hours before flying lest it affect their perception of blue hues) and some types of heart and tuberculosis medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet research suggests that even in the absence of eye disease or medication use, color perception can shift over the course of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Janneke van Leeuwen, a social neuroscientist and honorary research fellow at University College London’s Queen Square Institute of Neurology, noticed a subtle trend in behavioral studies from the last three decades: older adults &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/col.5080180606" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;consistently&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/1350946296000018?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rated&lt;/a&gt; colors duller than younger participants did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Van Leeuwen set out to investigate: do we truly see the world differently as we age?

They found a reduction in the way older people’s pupils responded to more highly saturated colors, even when correcting for the shrunken baseline pupil sizes that come with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Thus, it seems some older adults may genuinely perceive the world as less colorful. Van Leeuwen recalls one participant saying: “Oh, it’s a shame there’s not a real punchy red.” “I was thinking: ‘Well, you’re looking at one!’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The issue, Van Leeuwen explains, “doesn’t necessarily originate in the eyes, but in the brain”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pupil responses are controlled by the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, a midbrain structure that receives input from the retina and the visual cortex. This means that pupillary reactions reflect both what the eyes detect and how the brain processes that information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-15" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More research is needed to understand why, but the cause probably lies in how the cones in our eyes interact with color-processing pathways in the brain. Currently, Van Leeuwen is following up her study with an investigation into how differences in saturation perception influence the way colors make younger and older adults feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="bebe5a74-77d1-46e1-a0a0-f7747d4a54a4" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":18,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I’m an expert on ageing.

Believed to be an evolutionary trait for important evaluations such as the ripeness of fruit, this effect also takes place in the primary visual cortex. This “further supports our findings that the decline in sensitivity in color saturation in healthy ageing originates in the brain, and not the eyes”, says Van Leeuwen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There is no sign this loss of saturation perception follows the same process as the onset of certain types of dementia, Van Leeuwen emphasizes – many older adults experience vision declines without developing dementia, which has multiple risk factors. However, the study does provide insight into how our brains change as a result of normal, healthy ageing, which is useful context in the study of neurological disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Is there anything you can do to stop age-related declines in saturation perception? Researchers don’t currently believe that lifestyle habits can meaningfully influence this process. But there’s some evidence that the brain can be “trained” to see the world differently. Anya Hurlbert, a color and vision scientist at Newcastle University, points to a &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(20)30741-7.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; involving EnChroma glasses, which feature a saturation-boosting tint to help reduce the effects of some types of color blindness. Participants with red-green color perception deficiencies who wore the glasses reported seeing increased color saturation even after removing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alternatively, simply surrounding oneself with more intense colors could help. As Van Leeuwen notes, “Older adults tend to evaluate more saturated colors more positively than younger adults … which seems to suggest they might need the extra stimulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Just another reason to see the new Wes Anderson movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE52MVFUOWJWcF94dGJ5VG00cjhXZ2VMcFBKdHA0TnN3bVhjVTg0a3lYa1ljMkJHZk5LVXRLS2IxTUh6MUVVVmdWeV9TN1NjN2I2MXgtTUZjTzY1aVBFUFZOcWpOLTZpQ3IwanVScURpMmlZeGlpcldkX29zMTk</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚对3万只蚊子进行了测试，以验证一种新型驱蚊剂的有效性，而且非常有效。- evidencenetwork.ca</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggJBVV95cUxPSUMwSnBjZkNTX256UFVoT19HaUlRZUZNdXZoRF8xVW51V3JqS3VBNE5pQmxwanpidm43WDgzVmFrbjBKNHVyVEJjUkdXd194VHR6eTJNMEdnRFNqZ2IzSmhlX0ZScUdHa3pPV29uaXotRlc3RXJhNzBkZUNHaTFCRjVLUlM5MXRqY2JsSUc0MVU2ejd3Rjl2c01FZkRZS0ZVeWVsWEdkQ1dtZ3hGZDJzM0V0NHA2X1pXTGZDR3lSSVAwMzlLYnBhT2NLbF9BTWRtRmZyOU56OERnU3I5VGJzWnc4UUh5RlpETXByTlExdVZZTWpYTll4bXpmSUJmUndZU0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle against mosquitoes has intensified in recent years, particularly against the tiger mosquito species that poses significant health risks. A groundbreaking natural repellent has shown remarkable effectiveness in an extreme test involving thousands of these persistent pests. This innovative solution offers new hope for those seeking chemical-free protection during mosquito season.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Revolutionary natural mosquito repellent undergoes extreme testing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an extraordinary demonstration of confidence, a researcher in Guadeloupe recently subjected herself to a challenging test that few would dare attempt. Marie Modeste, a molecular biotechnology researcher, entered a sealed cage containing 32,000 hungry tiger mosquitoes after applying a natural repellent called Kreopik to her entire body. This test represents one of the most extreme evaluations of a mosquito repellent ever conducted.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The experiment began with a control test where Modeste inserted her arm into a small hermetic cage without any protection. As expected, this resulted in multiple bites. The main test followed, with the researcher entering a 3×3 meter sealed enclosure containing thousands of hungry insects that had been deprived of food for over eight hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After spending more than twenty minutes surrounded by the aggressive insects, Modeste emerged completely bite-free. While the experience was described as uncomfortable, the &lt;strong&gt;natural repellent’s effectiveness against tiger mosquitoes&lt;/strong&gt; was conclusively demonstrated under extreme conditions that far exceed what anyone would encounter in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This remarkable test shows promising results in our ongoing battle against disease vectors. Much like how &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/exercise-fights-cancer-now-we-understand-how/"&gt;exercise helps combat serious diseases like cancer&lt;/a&gt;, natural solutions can offer protection against insect-borne illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Locally sourced ingredients power effective protection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes Kreopik particularly noteworthy is its 100% natural composition based on locally sourced ingredients from Guadeloupe. The research team developed this repellent using a blend of:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essential oils with natural repellent properties&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Shea butter for smooth application and skin nourishment&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cocoa butter providing lasting protection and moisturization&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Other natural botanical ingredients native to the region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://la1ere.franceinfo.fr/guadeloupe/lutte-contre-les-moustiques-un-test-a-grande-echelle-avec-30-000-moustiques-tigres-1595688.html"&gt;According to this study&lt;/a&gt;, this &lt;strong&gt;natural tiger mosquito deterrent&lt;/strong&gt; represents a significant advancement in mosquito protection because it eliminates concerns about chemical exposure. Many conventional repellents contain DEET and other synthetic compounds that can cause skin irritation or raise health concerns, especially with frequent application.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research into natural repellents has gained momentum as public health concerns about mosquito-borne diseases increase. The spread of tiger mosquitoes resembles how &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/a-gene-has-given-the-black-plague-a-unique-adaptation-capacity/"&gt;certain diseases adapt and spread through genetic advantages&lt;/a&gt;, making effective countermeasures increasingly important.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind Kreopik are now expanding their work to develop a 100% natural herbicide, demonstrating a broader commitment to creating environmentally friendly solutions for common problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Comparing natural versus chemical repellents&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Features&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Natural Repellents&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Chemical Repellents&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Skin Sensitivity&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Generally gentle, moisturizing&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;May cause irritation or allergic reactions&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Environmental Impact&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Biodegradable, eco-friendly&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Potential water and soil contamination&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Duration of Effect&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Typically shorter (2-4 hours)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Longer-lasting (up to 8 hours)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Odor&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Often pleasant botanical scents&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Chemical smell that may be unpleasant&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why tiger mosquitoes pose a serious health threat&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) represents a significant public health concern in many regions worldwide. Originally native to Southeast Asia, this invasive species has spread to every continent except Antarctica. In Guadeloupe and increasingly in mainland France, these mosquitoes pose a growing threat to public health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes tiger mosquitoes particularly dangerous is their potential to transmit several serious diseases. &lt;em&gt;Their role as disease vectors makes them significantly more dangerous than mere nuisance insects&lt;/em&gt;. These mosquitoes can carry viruses that cause:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dengue fever – causing severe joint pain and potentially fatal complications&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Chikungunya – resulting in debilitating joint pain that can last for months&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Zika virus – particularly dangerous for pregnant women&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Yellow fever – a serious hemorrhagic disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tiger mosquitoes are also more challenging to detect than common mosquitoes. They are smaller, produce less buzzing noise, and their feeding behavior makes their presence less noticeable until after they’ve bitten. This stealthy nature increases exposure risk, similar to how &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/babies-treated-with-antibiotics-respond-less-well-to-vaccines/"&gt;certain medical treatments can affect immune responses without immediate notice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, tiger mosquitoes are diurnal feeders, active during daylight hours when people are typically outdoors, unlike many mosquito species that feed primarily at dawn and dusk. This behavior pattern increases human exposure and the subsequent risk of disease transmission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Advancing natural protection strategies against mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The successful testing of Kreopik opens new possibilities for &lt;strong&gt;natural mosquito protection solutions&lt;/strong&gt; that don’t rely on synthetic chemicals. As climate change expands the range of mosquito-borne diseases, the need for effective, safe repellents grows increasingly urgent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Environmental factors significantly influence mosquito populations and behavior. Research shows that the &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/the-brain-can-change-intestinal-bacteria-in-a-couple-of-hours/"&gt;relationship between environmental conditions and biological responses&lt;/a&gt; affects many aspects of public health, including insect-borne disease transmission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The development of natural repellents like Kreopik represents a holistic approach to mosquito control that addresses both human safety and environmental concerns. By utilizing sustainably sourced botanical ingredients, these solutions minimize ecological impact while providing effective protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regional adaptation of natural repellent formulations offers particular advantages&lt;/em&gt;, as locally available plants often evolve natural defenses against native insect species. This localized approach potentially creates more effective protection specific to regional mosquito populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As this research continues to advance, we may see more diverse natural options becoming available, giving consumers alternatives to chemical repellents while maintaining strong protection against these disease-carrying insects.&lt;/p&gt;

There were weightlifters and their murky shakes spiked with GNC powder, then the carb-shunning South Beach-ers of the early aughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2TSCO5LNABDHVO5BBVFSI4PQLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But these days, it’s not just the protein-maxing, macro-counting gym bros espousing their lust for the stuff. At some point, protein became the shibboleth for the suddenly trendy menopausal and perimenopausal set, along with power-walking in weighted vests. The MAGA movement, which &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2025/03/13/steak-shake-maga-beef-tallow/" target="_blank"&gt;touts beef tallow&lt;/a&gt; and red meat, is on board. Wellness influencers laud it for building strength and curbing appetites, while often overlooking the fact most of these products marketed as health foods qualify as the kind of ultra-processed fare we’re told to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DV4N4MIAIBDBTJZZ5QVVRVPKSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Acolytes are not just content to house chicken breasts and hard-boiled eggs and beef jerky. Everything, it seems, is getting protein-ified — even &lt;a href="https://store.orawellness.com/products/orawellness-smile-hydroxyapatite-toothpaste-paleo-cinnamony-mint?srsltid=AfmBOopbramT9xdIPxZkzJN71PRA5S94rJMRY3oYZBv6qchwbhP39Q-8" target="_blank"&gt;toothpaste&lt;/a&gt;, is case you want gums that are swole, not swollen. Never mind that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2025/01/02/how-much-protein-do-you-need/" target="_blank"&gt;most Americans are already eating the recommended amount of protein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6QJQSG5RGZHADE4PMD4ZWNXHQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How much is enough? The federal recommended dietary allowance is 0.8 grams daily per kilogram of body weight, which is about 54 grams of protein for a person weighing 150 pounds. But that is the minimum. For active people, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/24/protein-weight-loss-muscle-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;experts recommend between 1 to 1.2 grams per kilogram&lt;/a&gt; and even up to double the daily minimum. For athletes, some researchers recommend more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6XQYSR6UEVANLB5CGGBLUAYT54" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;No matter, food companies eager to capitalize on the collective hunger for protein are packing it into just about everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NCMRY6MCDBHRPGS4UMGCF4ADLQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You could, I noted to an editor, spend a day eat nothing but protein-boosted food, which is how I would end up with an assignment to do just that. (Perhaps this will teach me to keep such observations to myself.) With my mission set, I first went shopping, and found it easy to fill up a cart. The day was heavy on snacks since many of the popular products are designed for on-the-go eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RS3PRRTZ7RADZAF6TCYRJUBQZ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In my account below, I’ve noted the protein contained in one serving of each item I tried, although I did not finish a full serving of each. I wanted to survive the full day, after all. Here’s how my day of eating like a fruit-fearing amino acid freak went down:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U4IEWVGFBFG4LE2RXM3OGTQ23I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wheaties Protein (29 g protein per serving: 21 g from the cereal; 8 g from ¾ cup whole milk)&lt;/b&gt;: I started off like a champion — with a bowl of Wheaties. The company has always associated itself with athletes, so its new protein-packed flavors seem quite on-brand. I tried the honey pecan variety, whose sweetener gave the traditional flakes a strange texture, rendering them sticky and not crunchy. The cloying fake vanilla flavor wasn’t doing them any favors either, although I appreciated that at least some of the cereal’s protein came not just from soy protein isolate but from pecans and sunflower seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QGPTBBNZJBET3JDEXMS4TWDDQI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legendary Foods Strawberry Protein Pastry (20 g protein per serving):&lt;/b&gt; If you’re more of a Pop-Tart person, there’s a jacked-up breakfast for you — this sure looks like dupe for the nostalgic treat, with its confetti-flecked icing topping. A protein blend of calcium caseinate, micellar casein (both derived from dairy) and whey protein isolates were the first ingredients on a list that included a litany of unappealing lab-wizardry, from sugar substitutes erythritol and sucralose to Yellows No. 1 and 5. This Mock Tart tasted as fake as one might suspect, even after a warmup in the microwave that the wrapper promised would give me a “next level experience.” Honestly, I’d rather eat the grocery bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JWRKXQ4U6VDFBBCYAGBGZPI44A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ready Protein Water (20 g of protein per serving): &lt;/b&gt;Of course there is such a thing as protein water, a product that caused me to ask a question I never expected to mull: Can water feel slimy? The answer, it turns out, is yes! This drink was viscous and flavored with cherry, giving it both the mouthfeel and taste of cough syrup. Alas, it lingered long after I had managed to gulp it down, leaving behind a tooth-coating stevia sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5JAAMYIGC5CMRCHOHRVP72SPTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Khloud Protein Popcorn (7 g of protein per serving): &lt;/b&gt;My midmorning snack was the most high-profile of the lineup. The brand fronted by reality royalty Khloé Kardashian, promises “Good stuff zero fluff,” and after my last science experiment of a snack, the simple, easily pronounceable ingredients (popcorn, milk protein isolate, cane sugar, olive oil, coconut milk and mineral salt) were welcome. I would have preferred the white cheddar flavor, but my local market only had the sweet and salty kettle corn style in stock, so that’s what I went with. The kernels had a nice sweet-salt balance and no off flavors, but they felt a little stale, and the powdery dust covering them was chalky. Still, unlike nearly all of the other bites I tried on this fateful day, I actually went back for a second handful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TZBGFW3KARCGVFSO45W4ATFKCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barilla’s Protein+ pasta (10 g of protein per serving) and Chad &amp;amp; Barney’s&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sturdy Sauce (20 g of protein per serving): &lt;/b&gt;For lunch, a bowl of pasta awaited — but not anything your nonna would recognize. The penne got some heft from pea protein and chickpea flour, and the marinara was bulked up with something called “hydrolyzed bovine collagen.” The pasta itself was passable, if a tad gummy. But the bitter, astringent sauce tasted like licking a can of sour tomatoes. I was halfway through the day and already ready to quit — protein is supposed to help you get stronger, but my will to finish this project was suddenly feeling quite feeble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2YKI5R2WZ5A33GVNXPWQFRRL2A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Redefine Foods’ oatmeal protein pie (15 g of protein per serving): &lt;/b&gt;Later in the afternoon, I sampled a trio of peanut-powered products. First up was a sandwich of soft chocolate disks and a filling made with what I assumed was Skippy brand peanut butter. But when I examined the packaging, I noticed that nowhere was the phrase “peanut butter” actually used, and that underneath the large font used to tout the “chocolate” was the smaller modifier “flavored.” As it turned out, there wasn’t much of the promised flavoring, and I’m not sure I would have known the pie was chocolate if I didn’t have the visual cue and the packaging to tell me. The filling itself was fine at first bite, but I quickly got that suspiciously cloying note — and another glance at the wrapper revealed the culprit: stevia, my nemesis of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VWI2KDWCWNGXHPNWZTJ4VOZDD4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;One Reese’s Peanut Butter Lovers Flavored Protein Bar (18 g of protein per serving):&lt;/b&gt; Another giant of the peanut butter space, Reese’s, is half of the collab with protein-bar maker One. I sighed when I spotted yet more low-calorie sweeteners — this bar includes maltitol, a sugar alcohol; and isomalto-oligosaccharides, which are derived from starch — that gives this bar the feeling of a Franken-candy. It was chewy, gritty and brought to mind stale taffy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NPYT75G3RRFZBJCVFZVGPXSSCM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lenny &amp;amp; Larry’s Complete Cookie (8 g of protein per serving): &lt;/b&gt;This soft-baked cookie&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;with peanut butter and chocolate chip earned the dubious distinction of being my least-loathed of the three, with a chewy texture and more natural flavor. But if you’re in the game for protein, this cookie might be a bit misleading: The packaging says it contains 16 grams, but an examination of the nutritional label clarifies that the single cookie comprises two servings, meaning each serving contains only 8 grams of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K3APAVLIUFCGPMNNVAOB74KGSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quest protein chips (19 g of protein per serving):&lt;/b&gt; A combo of crispy snacks awaited me later. I was excited (well, as jazzed as I could be after the day’s onslaught) by the Quest tortilla-style chips in the ranch flavor, which some fans have hyped on social media as a substitute for Cool Ranch Doritos, my guilty pleasure of a road-trip snack. They were, alas, a pale shadow of that classic chip, with a one-note tang and a texture I found oddly … sandy? And really, people — more stevia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4UTNMHYWCNB6PID6VYUZN3RHUI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lenny &amp;amp; Larry’s Fitzels (7 g of protein per serving):&lt;/b&gt; This snack, a play on “pretzels” and … “fitness,” probably, offered more potential for misunderstanding. The packaging notes that there are 20 grams of protein per bag, but again, you have to read the fine print to glean that there are three servings in the small pouch. The “cinnamon bun” flavor had a nice bakery-like scent, but they didn’t have the same snap as real pretzels (perhaps due to the addition of pea protein). Still, I felt like I was ending the day on a relatively high note, because I didn’t want to actually throw this snack across the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SIQCMIZB4ZEB3LJR3PXLF644WY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;My day of protein-packed eating was, mercifully, over. I finished the marathon feeling a bit wiser (if more than a little nauseous): It seems that the world of protein-enhanced products is laden with so many highly processed ingredients. Shoppers should scour those ingredient labels carefully. And maybe not everything needs to be “health” food?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LEG4YGUP4NAPZNF2BAE4OR272E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I planned to skip dinner, probably.

All procedures complied with relevant ethical regulations. All post-mortem human brain and serum samples were fully deidentified before receipt, and no identifiable private donor information was accessible to the researchers. As such, informed consent was not applicable. Frozen post-mortem samples from the prefrontal cortex (BA9/10/47) were available for all cases included in the analysis. Cerebellar tissue and the most recently collected pre-mortem serum samples were available for a subset of individuals. The primary analysis was performed on tissue samples procured from the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center, derived from participants in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) or Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (referred to as ROSMAP).

The follow-up rate exceeded 95% and the autopsy rate exceeded 90%. All individuals who underwent autopsy were subject to a uniform structured neuropathological evaluation of AD. Informed consent, an Anatomic Gift Act and a repository consent were obtained and the studies were approved by an Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center. A second set of frozen frontal cortical brain samples was obtained from brain banks at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Duke University and Washington University, and is referred to as “a second independent cohort”. Brain tissue obtained from these sources had a confirmed pathological diagnosis of AD or NCI. Samples were randomly selected by the source institutions based on tissue availability and alignment with the requested diagnostic categories (NCI, MCI and AD). Within each diagnostic group, samples were matched for age and sex to ensure group comparability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolute and relative metal levels were measured by ICP–MS, with relative levels calculated as the ratio of cortical or cerebellar to serum concentrations from the same individual. Post-mortem interval had no significant effect on total or relative Li levels in this cohort. The study population comprised 40.2% male individuals and 59.8% female individuals. Within diagnostic subgroups, NCI cases comprised 40.8% male individuals and 59.2% female individuals; MCI cases, 42% male individuals and 58% female individuals; and AD cases, 36.4% male individuals and 63.6% female individuals. Individuals of both sexes were analysed, and those with MCI and AD, regardless of sex, exhibited significantly reduced cortical-to-serum Li ratios and lower total cortical Li levels. Donor sex was self-reported and provided by Rush Medical Center (ROSMAP study) and by further tissue sources, including Massachusetts General Hospital, Duke University and Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec13"&gt;Isolation of plaque-enriched and non-plaque fractions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fractionate brain parenchymal homogenates into amyloid plaque-enriched and non-plaque fractions, we modified a previously described protocol&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 61" title="Ihara, Y., Abraham, C. &amp;amp; Selkoe, D.

They were then washed with ultrapure PBS (which we determined contained less than 25 parts per trillion (ppt) Li) and incubated with a rabbit monoclonal anti-Aβ antibody (Cell Signaling, 8243) and a mouse monoclonal antibody to pSer202-tau (clone CP13) overnight in 2% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, followed by labelling with secondary anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor 594, or anti-mouse IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:300 in blocking buffer). The slides were then washed three times in ultrapure PBS and mounted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;ICP–MS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the analysis of metals in human and mouse biological samples, we modified previous protocols to optimize the detection of ultra-trace elements. We tested several protocols and found that the use of precleaned polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) vials fitted with perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA) caps, the use of ultra-trace grade reagents (nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide and water), combined with an extended sample digestion and homogenization, and a highly sensitive ICP–MS instrument (PerkinElmer NexION 2000C), allowed the robust detection of ultra-trace metals in human and mouse samples. The commercial precleaned PVDF vials (Elemental Scientific, V-14-0712-C) and PFA caps (Elemental Scientific, V-14-0309-C) were further processed by fully immersing them in 10% trace-grade nitric acid (Fisher Chemical, A509-P212) for at least 48 h, followed by abundant rinsing with double-distilled and deionized water and drying in a chemical hood for 48 h. The chemical hood was thoroughly cleaned before the experiment and was used exclusively for ICP–MS for the entire duration of the experiment to prevent contamination. We also used a protocol allowing for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of human brain samples (approximately 80–120 mg frozen brain material per region per case). First, we determined that the dry-to-wet ratio was unchanged in AD versus NCI. This was established in &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 45 NCI and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 45 AD frozen cortical samples (100–200 mg per sample) that were weighed and then dried to a constant weight (48 h in a dry oven at 60 °C). The dry-to-wet ratios were 0.127 ± 0.048 for NCI and 0.123 ± 0.034 for AD and were not statistically different (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.67), in agreement with previous work&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 63" title="Xu, J. et al.

The samples were fully digested after about 36 h. The serum, the brain non-plaque fractions and the aqueous solutions were digested in an equal volume of nitric acid (67%) for 48 h with regular vortexing (20 s per vial every 12 h). After digestion with nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide (30%; BDH Aristar Ultra, VWR, 87003-224) was added for 24 h with regular vortexing (20 s per vial every 12 h). We added one volume of hydrogen peroxide (w/m, relative to starting wet mass) to digested brain tissues and 0.75 volumes (relative to starting sample volume) to digested serum, non-plaque fractions and aqueous solutions. The samples were then diluted using a 2% nitric solution in ultrapure water (BDH Aristar, VWR, 87003-236). Indium was added to each solution as an internal standard (50 parts per billion; ppb). For all ICP–MS runs, we also measured freshly made solutions of element standards (0, 10 ppt, 50 ppt, 100 ppt, 1 ppb, 10 ppb and 50 ppb) using a 30-element ICP standard (Aristar, VWR, 89800-580). Each run included &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 10 digestion blanks as well as &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20–30 blank measurements to calculate the detection limits. The samples were injected into a PerkinElmer NexION 2000C ICP–MS instrument fitted with a cross-flow nebulizer and peristaltic pump for sample introduction. The sample delay time was 30 s with a pump speed of 24 rpm. A wash solution of 2% nitric was used between analyses of samples. The human cortex, cerebellum and serum samples were each measured twice on two consecutive days (two technical replicates per sample) and the average value was obtained for each sample. The correlation coefficients between the lithium concentrations measured on day 1 and day 2 were &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.99 for frontal cortex, cerebellum and serum, showing that the ICP–MS measurement was highly reproducible. After each run, ICP–MS signal processing was done using GeoPro 2010 Software (Cetac Technologies). We derived the standard curves for each element, calculated the concentration of each element in the diluted solution, and used the dilution factors to derive elemental abundance in the original samples. Li levels in the cortex and cerebellum are reported per unit of wet weight (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Fig1"&gt;1d,e&lt;/a&gt;, Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Fig6"&gt;1b&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#MOESM3"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). Limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) were calculated as follows: LOD = &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; + 2&lt;i&gt;tS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and LOQ = &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; + 10&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the average blank signal, &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; is the critical value of the one-tailed &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test (one-tailed, 95% confidence interval; for example, for 27 blank samples, df = 26 and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = 1.706) and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the standard deviation of a blank signal. LOD and LOQ values for all metals can be found in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#MOESM3"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. All individual Li measurements in human samples (prefrontal cortex, cerebellum and serum) were above the LOQ. In recovery experiments, wet brain samples or fluids were spiked with lithium standard added at three levels (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 7 replicates per spiking level). The recovery of Li from spiked samples ranged from 91% to 105%. All human sample measurements were double-blinded: one lab member not involved in the study relabelled the samples and kept a file with the old and new codes. After the ICP–MS measurements, the samples were unblinded in the presence of the researchers involved in the study, as well as the lab member who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ICP–MS findings from post-mortem human samples were replicated as follows. First, reduced Li content in the cortex of patients with AD was observed using two independent methods, after measurement of total Li levels in frozen cortical material of cases from both ROSMAP (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Fig1"&gt;1d&lt;/a&gt;) and other sources (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Fig1"&gt;1e&lt;/a&gt;), as well as after fractionation and removal of amyloid plaques (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Fig1"&gt;1g&lt;/a&gt;). Second, decreased Li levels in the AD versus NCI prefrontal cortex (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) were also independently confirmed when &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 60 NCI and AD cases were processed and analysed by ICP–MS in a different laboratory (the Spectroscopy Core Facility at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln). Third, decreased Li levels in the AD versus NCI prefrontal cortex (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) were also confirmed when &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 48 NCI and AD cases were processed using an alternative protocol. Frozen samples were thawed and dried to a constant weight by incubating in a dry oven at 60 °C for 48 h. The dried tissue was then digested in 1 ml of 67% nitric acid using a heating block at 95 °C for 3 h. After digestion, 0.3 ml of 30% hydrogen peroxide was added and the mixture was heated for a further 3 h. Finally, the samples were diluted and analysed using ICP–MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li levels measured in the PFC of ageing NCI cases (ROSMAP cases: mean 2.36 ± 1.23 ng per g, range 0.52–6.0 ng per g; non-ROSMAP cases: mean 3.50 ± 2.27 ng per g, range 0.89–9.94 ng per g; Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Fig1"&gt;1d,e&lt;/a&gt;) were similar to those measured in a previous study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 64" title="Ramos, P. et al.

Frozen human and mouse brains were first embedded in OCT medium and then sectioned using a cryostat, and the resulting sections (80 μm thick) were mounted onto glass slides. Before data acquisition, the samples were placed vertically in a rack and air-dried for 1 h. The LA-ICP–MS spectrometer consisted of a laser ablation system (213 nm Nd:YAG, Cetac Technologies) connected to a Perkin Elmer NexION 2000C ICP–MS (Perkin Elmer). Using the line tool, we manually selected the area to be ablated. For human samples, we ablated a region of the prefrontal cortex. For mouse samples, we processed coronal sections where the cortex and hippocampus were readily identifiable. The analyte signal was collected using multiple parallel line scans along the entire selected area, progressing in the direction of ablation cell gas flow, using a spot size of 200 µm at 75 µm s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The laser operated at an energy level of 70% and a pulse repetition rate of 20 Hz. The typical run time for one sample was about 4–5 h. We also ablated parts of each section that did include brain tissue but contained embedding medium (OCT) and subtracted this background signal from the total signal. Levels of &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li were normalized to carbon (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C) to correct for any variations in the amount of tissue ablated. Similar conclusions were reached when the analysis did not include normalization to &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C. Matrix-matched standards were obtained by spiking homogenized samples of human or mouse tissue with three different concentrations of metal standard solution containing the analytes of interest. After homogenization, the mixtures were frozen and 80-μm sections were cut using the cryostat. The final concentrations of these standards were validated by ICP–MS. After LA-ICP–MS data acquisition, signal processing was done using Iolite Software 2018 (Iolite). A Li distribution matrix was generated computationally, using the multiple parallel line rasters. To identify the regions occupied by amyloid plaques, the section immediately adjacent to the section analysed by LA-ICP–MS was processed for Aβ immunofluorescence. In brief, the adjacent section was first fixed with 4% PFA for 2 h then washed three times with PBS. The section was then blocked for 1 h with 2% BSA, 2% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The anti-Aβ primary antibody (Cell Signaling, 8243), diluted 1:250 in blocking buffer, was then added and the section was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the section was washed three times with PBS (in total, 30 min), and a secondary anti-rabbit Alexa 594 antibody (diluted 1:300 in blocking buffer) was added for 3 h. The section was finally washed three times with PBS (for 30 min) and mounted. We acquired multiple pictures of Aβ immunofluorescence spanning the entire section using an Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope. The images were then stitched together and imported into Iolite, where the distribution of Aβ immunofluorescence was computationally superimposed on the LA-ICP–MS Li distribution matrix. For each human or mouse sample, we manually selected multiple regions containing Aβ plaques (plaque or ‘P regions’) as well as neighbouring regions devoid of plaques (non-plaque or ‘NP regions’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mean Li levels in P and NP regions were determined, and after correcting for background and normalizing to &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, the P:NP ratios were calculated. Three other isotopes were also assessed: &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;Cu and &lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;Zn. All measurements in P and NP regions exceeded the LOQ, which was 0.82 ng per g for &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li, 0.23 µg per g for &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, 0.44 µg per g for &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;Cu and 55.1 ng per g for &lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;Zn). As positive controls, &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;Cu and &lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt;Zn were all enriched in plaques relative to non-plaque regions in the AD brain, consistent with previous observations&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 66" title="Hutchinson, R.

The low Li dose corresponded to 4.3 μEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (equivalent to 0.03 mg (30  µg) of elemental Li per litre). The background Li concentration in the water was minimal (0.109 µg l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Solutions of 4.3 µM LiO and 2.15 µM LiC were prepared to deliver equivalent amounts of elemental Li, accounting for the two Li atoms per molecule of LiC (Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). A 4.3 µM sodium orotate (NaO) solution was also prepared to assess the effects of the orotate anion in the absence of Li. Two more Li doses were also tested: 43 µEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (delivered as 43 µM LiO) and 430 µEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (delivered as 430 µM LiO or 215 µM Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). To control for the orotate anion at the high dose, a 430 µM NaO solution was also tested. Average daily water consumption was comparable across all treatment groups and the vehicle (water-only) group. To evaluate Li uptake and its biological effects in the brain, mice received the Li-containing water for defined periods. Animals were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, with control mice receiving plain drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;Conductivity measurements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the conductivity of Li salts, the salts were dissolved in water to achieve Li concentrations of 4.3 mEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, 430 μEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, 43 μEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or 21.5 μEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in each case. Conductivity was measured using an ST300C conductivity meter (OHAUS, 83033964) equipped with a STCON7 electrode (OHAUS, 30080693) calibrated with potassium chloride conductivity standards. For each lithium salt, three independent solution replicates (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3) were prepared. Conductivity values are reported in μS per cm at 25 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;In vitro binding of lithium to Aβ&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the in vitro binding of Li to Aβ, both oligomeric and fibrillar forms of Aβ42 were prepared. Human Aβ1–42 peptide (1 mg) was initially dissolved in 80 μl of 1% NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH then diluted with PBS to a final concentration of 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (stock solution) and stored at −80 °C. Oligomeric Aβ42 was generated by resuspending the stock solution in PBS followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. Fibrillar Aβ42 was obtained by incubating the same stock at 37 °C for 72 h. For Li binding assays, 10 µg of either oligomeric or fibrillar Aβ42 (10 µl of the 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; stock) was added to 90 µl of Li-containing solutions. These solutions included varying concentrations of either LiO or LiC, matched for Li content and dissolved in ultrapure water (BDH Aristar, VWR, 87003-236). Ultrapure water alone served as the negative control. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. After incubation, the mixtures were transferred to dialysis membranes for 24 h to remove unbound Li (Pur-A-Lyzer mini dialysis kits were used: 6–8 kDa cut-off for oligomers and 25 kDa for fibrils). After dialysis, the samples were transferred into precleaned PVDF vials and digested by adding an equal volume of 67% nitric acid (final volume, 200 µl), followed by a 24-h digestion period. The digested samples were then diluted to 800 µl with 2% nitric acid prepared in ultrapure water. Li content was quantified using a PerkinElmer NexION 2000C ICP–MS instrument. Elemental Li standards were prepared and standard curves showed excellent linearity (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.99). The bound &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li levels were calculated across a range of Li salt concentrations, and binding curves were plotted using GraphPad Prism (v.9.4.1). Binding affinities (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) and 95% confidence intervals for LiO and LiC were determined using nonlinear regression analysis ([agonist] versus response–variable slope, four-parameter model; Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#MOESM15"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;). Binding to Aβ42 oligomers and fibrils was modelled across the full concentration range (0–500 μEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) as well as within the higher-affinity subranges (0–50 μEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for oligomers and 0–30 μEq l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for fibrils; Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#MOESM15"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Mice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal housing and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Harvard Medical School. All mice were housed socially (2–4 animals per cage) in a room with a 12 h:12 h  light:dark cycle (lights on at 06:00), controlled for temperature (18–22 °C) and humidity (40–60%). Sentinel mice housed in each rack were tested quarterly and confirmed to be free of pathogens. All cages were individually ventilated. The standard diet 5053, as well as the chemically defined control and Li-deficient diets, were irradiated. Reverse osmosis deionized water and deionized water containing LiO, LiC or NaO was provided ad libitum in bottles that were changed at least weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wild-type mice were on a C57BL/6J background. We analysed both adult (3–6 months old) and aged (up to 26 months old) wild-type mice, treated for varying durations.

For breeding, 10–20 females (all litter-mates derived from the same cross) were typically mated with 8–12 males (all litter-mates derived from the same cross). Mice were identified by numbered ear tags and were randomly selected for behavioural and histological analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess treatment effects on disease onset and progression, animals were treated either before pathology emerged (5–6 months old for 3xTg; 3 months old for J20) or after pathology was established (starting at 9 months old for 3xTg and 17 months old for J20). To investigate age-related effects in wild-type mice, chronic treatments were initiated in adulthood (10–12 months old) and continued for 10–14 months during ageing. Experiments included both sexes, and results were consistent between males and females. The number and sex of animals used in each experimental group can be found in the Source Data file. Investigators remained blinded to genotypes and treatment conditions throughout data collection and analysis. No prior sample-size calculations were done, but the number of animals used was consistent with similar studies in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Mouse diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li levels in the cortex were comparable between human NCI cases (RUSH cohort: range 0.52–6.0 ng per g; non-RUSH cohort: range 0.89–9.94 ng per g) and mice (wild type and J20: range 1.61–4.59 ng per g). Similarly, serum Li levels in human NCI cases (range 1.53–10.41 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) overlapped with those in mice (wild type, J20, 3xTg: range 0.75–4.50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), supporting the relevance of mouse models for studying the biological effects of lithium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regular mouse 5053 is a grain-based diet that does not allow Li levels to be manipulated experimentally. To obtain a Li-deficient diet, we used a standard, chemically defined mouse AIN-93M diet that is calorically and nutritionally equivalent to the 5053 diet and was formulated as a standard diet for laboratory rodents by the American Institute of Nutrition in 1993. We tested 5 samples of the regular mouse 5053 diet and 5 samples of the AIN-93M diet and found that the average Li content was 104.8 ng per g in the 5053 diet and 103 ng per g in the AIN-93M diet. The AIN-93M chemically defined diet was modified to exclude Li. The Li-deficient and control AIN-93M diets were formulated by Dyets. We measured Li levels in the Li-deficient diet and confirmed that Li was depleted by 92.0% relative to the chemically defined control diet. The abundances of the other 26 metals that we measured by ICP–MS were identical (data not shown). The solid diets were irradiated before administration to animals. The diets were stored in closed plastic bags that were placed inside cardboard boxes (devoid of light) at −20 °C for up to 4 months before administration to animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec21"&gt;DNA extraction and genotyping by PCR&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We collected about 0.5–1.0 cm of mouse tails in clean Eppendorf tubes; 500 μl of tail lysis buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS) containing 0.4 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Proteinase K was added to each tube, and the tubes were incubated overnight in a 56 °C water bath. The next day, 500 μl of isopropanol was added to precipitate the DNA, and the tubes were shaken vigorously for 20 s. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 18,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; and the isopropanol was carefully removed, avoiding the DNA pellet. We then added 70% ethanol and shook the tubes to wash the DNA pellet. We next centrifuged the tubes for 10 min at 18,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. We removed the ethanol and air-dried the DNA pellet for 2–16 h. The DNA was resuspended in 100 μl acetate-EDTA buffer and placed in a 56 °C water bath overnight. To amplify DNA regions by PCR, we mixed 3 μl of DNA sample with corresponding amounts of forward and reverse PCR primers, PCR master mix and nuclease-free water, and ran the reactions in a thermocycler. Sample loading dye was added to the PCR products and the samples were run on 1–3% agarose gels (prepared by dissolving agarose in TAE buffer, to which Gel Red was added to allow DNA visualization). We also loaded a 100-bp DNA ladder. Gels were visualized using a UV transilluminator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;Quantitative RT–PCR&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total RNA was extracted from cells and tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by DNase treatment to remove genomic DNA contamination. Primers were obtained from Harvard’s PrimerBank: for mouse &lt;i&gt;Gsk3b&lt;/i&gt;, forward 5′-TGGCAGCAAGGTAACCACAG-3′ and reverse 5′-CGGTTCTTAAATCGCTTGTCCTG-3′; for mouse &lt;i&gt;Gapdh&lt;/i&gt;, forward 5′-CTTTGTCAAGCTCATTTCCTGG-3′ and reverse 5′-TCTTGCTCAGTGTCCTTGC-3′. Real-time PCR was performed for 40 cycles. The specificity and purity of PCR and RT–PCR products were confirmed by the presence of single-peak melting curves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;GSK3β inhibitor treatment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li-deficient and control 3xTg mice 12 months old, maintained on their respective diets for three months, were treated with the GSK3β inhibitor CHIR-99021 or a vehicle control. A stock solution of CHIR-99021 was prepared in DMSO and diluted in 0.9% saline to a final concentration of 10 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, containing 2% DMSO. The solution was warmed to 70 °C to ensure dissolution of the compound. Mice received intraperitoneal injections of CHIR99021 at a dose of 50 mg per kg body weight, once daily for 14 consecutive days. Control animals received equivalent volumes of vehicle (2% DMSO in saline). All animals tolerated the treatment without visible abnormalities and were included in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Blood chemistry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUN and creatinine measurements were done by IDEXX Laboratories, using mouse serum samples. TSH levels in the mouse serum were assessed by ELISA (Elabscience, E-EL-M1153).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Behavioural testing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec26"&gt;Open field&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were placed in an open field box (75 cm × 75 cm) and movements were tracked in real-time using TopScan Lite software (CleverSys) coupled to a camera. Each mouse was recorded for 10 min, and the average speed and distance travelled were automatically recorded. Mice had no prior exposure to the open-field arena (spontaneous test). All behavioural experiments were performed by researchers who were blinded to the experimental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec27"&gt;Morris water maze&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess spatial learning and memory, we trained and tested mice in a large circular pool (1.1 m in diameter) filled with 21 °C water, which was rendered opaque by the addition of non-toxic white paint. We placed four distinct visual cues (representing different geometric shapes, patterns and colours) on each wall, to facilitate spatial orientation and the acquisition of spatial memory. Mice were given four training trials a day for 5–7 consecutive days. Each training trial lasted for 1 min. Mice were trained to remember the location of a hidden platform that was submerged 2.5 cm below the water surface. The location of the hidden platform (south-east) remained the same during the 5–7-day training period. If, after a 60-second trial, the animal failed to locate the platform, it was placed on the platform and allowed to remain on the platform for 15 s. Mice were trained four times a day and entered the pool in a randomized order of rotating entrance points (compass directions N, S, E, W, NE and SW). During each training trial, the latency to find the hidden platform was recorded. Then, 24 h after the last training trial, a probe trial was conducted. The platform was removed and mice entered the arena from the NW location (opposite from the platform). The number of entries in the target area (representing the area where the platform had been located during the training trials), the total time spent in the target area, as well as the time spent in all quadrants, and the swimming speed were recorded during the 60-s probe trial. We also conducted separate trials in which a visible platform (platform elevated above the water level, on which a small red flag had been placed) was presented. Mice were given several training sessions and the time (latency) to reach the visible platform was recorded. Mouse movements, as well as average speed, distance travelled, latency to reach a quadrant or target area and number of entries in the target area, were tracked in real time using TopScan Lite software (Clever Sys) and the different measures were automatically recorded. For measurements of learning (latency to reach the platform during the training trials), mice underwent repeated measurements (four measurements a day for 6–7 consecutive days).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec28"&gt;Novel-object recognition&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were placed in the same open-field box with two novel identical objects for 10 min and allowed to freely explore the identical objects. The next day, mice were reintroduced in the open-field box and presented with a novel object, as well as one of the two objects they explored the previous day. The mice were allowed to explore the objects for 10 min and their movements were tracked in real time using TopScan Lite software (Clever Sys) coupled to a camera. The box and items were cleaned with 70% ethanol between mice. We automatically recorded the time each mouse spent exploring each object, on both day 1 (two identical objects) or day 2 (one novel object and one familiar object), and derived a novelty (discrimination) index, defined as the ratio of time spent exploring the novel object relative to the familiar one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec29"&gt;Y maze&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous alternation, which is a measure of spatial working memory, was assessed by allowing the mice to freely explore a Y-shaped maze for 8 min. The Y maze consisted of 3 arms (each 40 cm × 8 cm x 15 cm) at an angle of 120° from each other. Mice typically preferred to investigate a new arm of the maze, rather than returning to one that was previously visited. Using TopScanLite software, we recorded each entry in one of the three arms (A, B and C) and then derived the percentage of total correct alternations over the 8-min duration of the trial. A correct alternation (triad) is a succession of entries into three different arms (A–B–C, A–C–B, B–A–C, B–C–A, C–A–B or C–B–A).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;Mouse neuropathology&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and carbon dioxide and then perfused with PBS at 4 °C for 20 min. Brains were rapidly removed and the two hemispheres were separated. One hemisphere was dissected into subregions (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum). Each subregion was placed in a separate Eppendorf tube, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored in a freezer at −80 °C. The second hemisphere was placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h. The fixed brain was then processed for paraffin embedding, using standard procedures. Paraffin-embedded blocks were sectioned and 6-μm sections were mounted on glass slides and used for histological analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paraffin-embedded mouse brain blocks were sectioned and the sections were mounted on glass slides. We deparaffinized the sections by immersion in two xylene baths for a total of 10 min, followed by a 5-min immersion in a 50% xylene:50% ethanol solution. The sections were then rehydrated by immersion in solutions of decreasing concentrations of ethanol (95%, 90%, 70% and 50%) and then placed in water. Sections then underwent antigen retrieval using the Diva decloaker (BioCare). Sections were blocked with 3% BSA, 3% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 45 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#MOESM18"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt; has a list of antibodies used for immunolabelling) were diluted in 3% BSA, 3% FBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, sections were washed three times with PBS. Secondary antibodies, diluted in 3% BSA, 3% FBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS were either biotin-coupled (1:200; Vector Labs) or coupled to Alexa fluorophores (1:300, Invitrogen). After three 10-min washes with PBS, sections were mounted with Pro-Long anti-fade mounting medium with DAPI (Invitrogen) and then imaged using confocal microscopy. For the Aβ labelling shown in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Fig6"&gt;1e&lt;/a&gt;, we incubated sections with an anti-rabbit biotinylated IgG secondary antibody (VectorLabs) for 1 h, followed by three washes in PBS (1 min each) and the addition of avidin-streptavidin-HRP-coupled complex (1:200 in 2% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS; VectorLabs). After three washes with PBS, we added diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate (prepared by dissolving DAB and peroxide tablets in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for several minutes, until a brown precipitate formed. Sections were then washed with PBS, dehydrated with increasing ethanol concentrations (50%, 70%, 90%, 95% and 100%), followed by incubation with a 50% ethanol:50% xylene solution and two immersions in 100% xylene (5 min each). Sections were mounted with a hydrophobic mounting medium (Permount). For Thioflavin S staining, after deparaffinization the brains were incubated with filtered 1% aqueous Thioflavin-S for 8 min at room temperature, then washed twice (3 min each) in 80% ethanol, once in 95% ethanol (3 min), three times in distilled water and finally mounted. For sections labelled by immunofluorescence, multiple confocal images were acquired using an Olympus Fluoview Confocal Microscope FV3000. For DAB-stained sections, we acquired pictures using a bright-field microscope coupled with a camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For analysis of the Aβ plaque burden, pictures of Aβ immunoreactivity (using the rabbit anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody, clone D54D2, Cell Signaling, 8243, dilution 1:250) in the hippocampus were processed using a macro developed for use with Fiji/ImageJ 2.9.0. In brief, confocal pictures were all saved in the same folder and were all automatically opened in Fiji and processed serially. For each picture, the background was subtracted (rolling ball radius was set for 25). Pictures then underwent de-noising, using a Gaussian blur filter (radius of one pixel). The images were then thresholded using the Default Fiji threshold set at 120. Particles with a minimal size of 5 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; were retained and their number, average size and mean fluorescence intensity were automatically recorded for each picture in an Excel file. To calculate the Aβ plaque burden, the total area occupied by Aβ plaques was divided by the area of the selection. Three coronal sections (6 μm thick) were sampled for each animal, in the rostral, intermediate and ventral hippocampus. Two 20× images were acquired per section, using an Olympus FluoView LV1000 confocal microscope. The average Aβ burden was obtained by averaging the Aβ plaque density (area occupied by Aβ plaques divided by the total area analysed) in all pictures acquired for each animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For analysis of tau pathology, pictures of p-Ser202 tau (CP13, dilution 1:150) or p-Ser396/Ser404 tau (PHF1, dilution 1:200) immunoreactivity in the hippocampus CA1 were processed using a macro developed for use with Fiji/ImageJ 2.9.0. In brief, confocal pictures were all saved in the same folder and were all automatically opened in Fiji and processed serially. Pictures underwent de-noising, using a Gaussian blur filter (radius of one pixel). The images were then thresholded using the Default Fiji threshold set at 150. The number of tau-positive neurons in the selected CA1 area was then manually counted for each thresholded picture and the area was measured. For each picture, we calculated the average density of tau-positive neurons (the total number of tau-positive neurons divided by the area of the region). The average tau-positive neuron densities were calculated for each animal by averaging all the pictures acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluorescent image analysis was also performed using MetaMorph NX 2.5 (Meta Series, Molecular Devices). Mean fluorescence intensity for specific markers was quantified in each animal either in the nucleus (β-catenin) or across the entire cell body (for example, GSK3β, pSer9-GSK3β, pTyr216-GSK3β, GPNMB and LPL), based on co-labelling with cell-type-specific markers (such as MAP2, aspartoacylase and Iba1). Between 50 and 300 cells per mouse were analysed, and background signal was subtracted. Synaptophysin and PSD-95 fluorescence intensities were quantified in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and FluoroMyelin, MBP and SMI-312 intensities were measured in the corpus callosum, with background subtraction applied in all cases. Cell densities of Iba1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, aspartoacylase&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, PDGFRα&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and GFAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; populations were also determined in relevant brain regions by quantifying 50–500 cells per mouse. For each measurement, multiple images were acquired at 4×, 10×, 20× or 40× magnification per animal, spanning the region of interest. Values were averaged for each animal before statistical analysis. The following primary antibodies were also used: anti-aspartoacylase [N1C3-2] (GeneTex, GTX113389; rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-aspartoacylase (clone D-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-377308, mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:50), anti-β-catenin (clone E247; Abcam, ab32572; rabbit recombinant monoclonal, dilution 1:250), anti-β-catenin (clone 1B8A1; PTGlab, 66379-1-Ig, mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-CD68 (clone KP1; Abcam, ab955; mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-GFAP (Sigma-Aldrich, G9269; rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-GSK3β (clone 3D10; Novus Bio, NBP1-47470SS; mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-pTyr216-GSK3β (Millipore Sigma, SAB4300237; rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:100), anti-pSer9-GSK3β (Abcam, ab131097; rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:100), anti-Iba1 (clone EPR16588; Abcam ab178846; rabbit recombinant monoclonal, dilution 1:2,000), anti-PSD-95 (clone K28/43; Biolegend, 810401; mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:250), anti-synaptophysin (clone SY38; Millipore Sigma, mouse monoclonal, MAB5258-I; dilution 1:200), anti-neurofilament marker (pan axonal marker; clone SMI-312; Biolegend, 837904; mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-GPNMB (clone 2B10B8; PTGlab, 66926-1-Ig; mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-LPL (Novus Bio, AF7197-SP; goat polyclonal, dilution 1:200), anti-MAP2 (Phosphosolutions, 1099-MAP2; goat polyclonal, dilution 1:500), anti-MBP (clone D8X4Q; Cell Signaling, 78896; rabbit monoclonal, dilution 1:200) and anti-PDGFRα (R&amp;amp;D Systems, AF1062; goat polyclonal, dilution 1:200). Secondary antibodies were used at a 1:300 dilution: donkey anti-goat Alexa 594 (Invitrogen, A-11058), donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) Highly Cross-Adsorbed antibody, Alexa 488 (ThermoFisher Scientific, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/A21206"&gt;A21206&lt;/a&gt;), donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) Highly Cross-Adsorbed antibody, Alexa 594 (ThermoFisher Scientific, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/A21203"&gt;A21203&lt;/a&gt;), donkey anti-mouse Alexa 647 (Invitrogen, A-31571), donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 647 (Invitrogen, A-31573) and donkey anti-goat Alexa 488 (Invitrogen, A-11055).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec31"&gt;Golgi labelling&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brains were processed and stained using the FD Rapid Golgistain Kit (FD Neurotechnologies, PK401) following the manufacturer’s protocol with minor modifications. Immediately after dissection, the brains were fixed overnight in 4% PFA. After cryosectioning, free-floating sections of 100 μm were shortly (10 min) fixed in 4% PFA, then stained using the kit’s reagents and mounted using a glycerin-containing medium. Then 12 dendrites per mouse were imaged in the hippocampus or the cortex using a confocal microscope. Dendritic spine density was quantified using Fiji software v.2.9.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec32"&gt;Transmission electron microscopy&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3xTg mice were fed either a Li-deficient diet (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8) or a control diet (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8) from 6 to 12 months of age. At the end point, mice were perfused with a fixative containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2.5% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15949). After perfusion, 1–2-mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; brain sections were generated and post-fixed overnight at 4 °C in fresh fixative. The corpus callosum was subsequently dissected and processed for embedding in TAAB Epon resin at the Harvard Electron Microscopy Core Facility. In brief, tissue was washed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide for 1 h, rinsed in distilled water and incubated in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 h. After two further water rinses, samples were dehydrated through graded ethanol (50%, 70%, 90% and twice in 100%, for 10 min each) followed by 1 h in propylene oxide. Samples were then infiltrated overnight in a 1:1 mixture of propylene oxide and TAAB Epon (Marivac), embedded in pure TAAB Epon the next day and polymerized at 60 °C for 48 h. Ultrathin sections (approximately 80 nm thick) were cut on a Reichert Ultracut-S microtome, mounted on copper grids, stained with lead citrate and imaged using either a JEOL 1200EX or a Tecnai G&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Spirit BioTWIN transmission electron microscope. Images were captured using an AMT 2k CCD camera and saved in TIFF format. Quantification of myelin sheath thickness, axon diameter and g-ratio was performed using MetaMorph NX 2.5 software (Meta Series, Molecular Devices). A total of 1,376 axons (control group) and 1,396 axons (Li-deficient group) were analysed from eight randomly selected fields per animal (×4,800 magnification) spanning the corpus callosum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec33"&gt;Aβ detection by ELISA&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouse endogenous Aβ&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;–40 and Aβ&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;–42 levels were measured using a previously established protocol&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 67" title="Teich, A.

In brief, hippocampi or cortices were homogenized in 20 volumes (v/w) of tissue lysis buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA and 250 mM sucrose, supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche) and 100 μM AEBSF. Soluble Aβ species were extracted from tissue homogenates by diethanolamine treatment.

Sample concentrations ranged from 26.21 to 52.98 pmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for Aβ(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;–40) and from 11.72 to 22.40 pmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for Aβ&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;–42, all above the respective LOQs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec34"&gt;Assessment of microglial function in vitro&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec35"&gt;Microglial purification for cell-culture assays&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wild-type Li-deficient and control mice were transcardially perfused with 1× cold PBS. The cortex and hippocampus were dissected and minced using a scalpel before transferring them to 5 ml digestion buffer (2 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of Dispase II, 20 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; DNase I, 10 μM HEPES in HBSS without calcium or magnesium). Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C on an orbital shaker. The tissue was then homogenized by successive trituration with a Pasteur pipette followed by a 1 ml pipette. An equal volume of 1× HBSS was added to the homogenate and the resulting mix was passed through a 70-µm cell strainer, then centrifuged at 300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples were resuspended with 40% Percoll (GE Healthcare, 17-0891-02) to remove myelin, and microglia were enriched using CD11b beads, as described above. Microglia were resuspended in pre-warmed media (DMEM/F12 with 2% FBS, 100 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; IL-34, 50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; TGFβ1, 25 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; M-CSF) and counted using a haemocytometer. Microglia were seeded into 96-well glass-bottom plates precoated with poly-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-ornithine (Sigma, P4957) at 5,000 cells per well using 100 μl of medium. A half-medium change was performed on day 2 and the downstream assay was done on day 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary microglia were also purified using an alternative protocol. After perfusion, the cortex and hippocampus were dissected, placed in 3 ml buffer (0.9% Hepes, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and minced with small scissors for 4 min. Then, 7 ml Dispase buffer (2 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Dispase II in 0.9% Hepes, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) was added and the tissue was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C on an orbital shaker. The tissue was then homogenized by gently triturating with a 10 ml pipette with a wide bore, to prevent cell shearing. The enzyme activity was halted by the 1:1 addition of 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS (10 ml) at 4 °C. The homogenate was passed through a 70-µm cell strainer to remove meninges and clumped cells. The homogenate was then spun for 10 min at 1,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; and 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 6 ml of 75% isotonic percoll in PBS (high percoll; GE Healthcare, 17-0891-02). Then 5 ml of 35% isotonic percoll in PBS (low percoll) was added, followed by 4 ml of PBS. The resulting discontinuous gradient was allowed to settle for 15 min at 4 °C. We then centrifuged the tubes at 800&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 45 min at 4 °C. We then aspirated the top (PBS-containing) layer and part of the upper percoll layer. The band containing microglia (approximately 1.5 ml), situated at the interface between the 35% percoll and 75% percoll layers, was gently collected. Then 50 ml of PBS was gently added and the tube was inverted 20 times. The microglia were then centrifuged at 1,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in a pre-warmed (at 37 °C) buffer containing 2% fetal bovine serum, 50 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin and 50 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; streptomycin in RPMI medium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BV2 microglial cell line has been maintained in the Yankner laboratory for more than 20 years and stored long-term in liquid nitrogen at –180 °C.

Oligomeric Aβ1–42 was prepared by resuspending the stock solution in DMEM/F12 to 500 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (100 μM) and overnight incubation at 4 °C.

To assess Aβ42 uptake, cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, followed by three washes with 1× PBS and fixation with 4% PFA for 15 min. To assess microglial Aβ42 degradation, cells incubated with Aβ42 oligomers for 3 h were first washed three times with warm medium. The cells were then incubated with warm medium devoid of Aβ42 for an extra 3 h. They were then washed with 1× PBS and fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and blocked with 2% BSA, 2% FBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h. Anti-Iba1 and anti-Aβ (6E10) antibodies, diluted 1:500 in the blocking buffer, were then added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the cells were washed three times with PBS 1× and incubated with secondary antibodies (1:300 in blocking buffer) at room temperature for 2 h. Cells were washed three times with 1× PBS, then mounted and analysed by confocal microscopy. We also assessed Aβ42 uptake and clearance by microglia using fluorescently labelled (HiLyte Fluor 555) human Aβ1–42 (AnaSpec, AS-60480). The fluorescently labelled Aβ42 was directly added to the medium containing 2% FBS to reach a concentration of 2 ng µl&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the uptake and degradation assays were conducted as detailed above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec37"&gt;Microglial stimulation and treatment with GSK3β inhibitors&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess cytokine release, primary microglia isolated from control and Li-deficient mice were treated with 50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; LPS on day 2 for 16 h followed by supernatant collection.

Subsequently, single nuclei were diluted to 9 ml in HB buffer, passed through a 40-μm filter and separated from debris and multinuclei by iodixanol gradient centrifugation. Specifically, we prepared a 50% iodixanol solution by diluting 60% iodixanol (Optiprep density gradient medium, Sigma D1556) with diluent (150 mM KCl, 30 mM MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 120 mM Tricine-KOH, pH7.8), and subsequently diluted them with HB buffer and supplemented with 0.04% BSA and 64 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; RNasin Plus ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega, N2611) to prepare 40% iodixanol and 30% iodixanol. We layered 1 ml of 40% iodixanol in the bottom, 1 ml of 30% iodixanol in the middle and gently layered 9 ml of the diluted nuclei suspension on top of the 30% iodixanol layer. The three layers were visually confirmed to be distinct and were subjected to 18 min of 10,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; centrifugation. Single nuclei were carefully recovered from the 30% iodixanol layer in between the 30% and 40% interface. An aliquot was taken for trypan blue staining and visual inspection of nucleic morphology under a microscope, which showed a homogeneous size distribution and absence of major debris or doublets. The numbers of nuclei were determined initially by haemocytometer and subsequently confirmed with an automated counter. The remainder of the nucleic suspension was diluted for nuclei encapsulation and sequencing library preparation at the Harvard Single Cell Core, according to the 10X Genomics manual. The size and quality of the prepared libraries were confirmed on Agilent high-sensitivity TapeStation and the library was independently quantified by qPCR.

Finally, microglia were released with 5 ml MACs buffer (without EDTA), then used for RNA extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec44"&gt;Microglial RNA sequencing quality control and analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total microglial RNA was extracted from MACs-purified microglia using RNAzol RT (Sigma, R4533). RNA extracted from each microglial preparation was quantified using an Agilent Tapestation 4200 instrument, with a corresponding Agilent Tapestation High Sensitivity RNA assay (5067-5579). The samples were normalized to 4 ng of input in 9.5 μl, and the polyadenylated mRNA was selected for using 3′ SMART-Seq CDS Primer II A as part of the Takara SMART-Seq v.4 Ultra Low Input RNA (634894) workflow, which generated cDNA. From there, an Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA assay (5067-4626) was used to quantify the cDNA concentration. Libraries were obtained using the Illumina NexteraXT kit (FC-131-1096). Adapter ligation, indexing and amplification were done subsequently as part of the same workflow. After amplification, residual primers were eluted away using KAPA Pure Beads (07983298001) in a 0.6× SPRI-based clean-up. The resulting purified libraries were run on an Agilent 4200 Tapestation instrument, with a corresponding Agilent D5000 ScreenTape assay (5067-5588 and 5067-5589) to visualize the libraries and check the size and concentration of each library. Molarity values obtained from this assay were used to normalize all samples in equimolar ratio for one final pool. The pooled library was denatured and loaded onto a single lane of an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell to generate 100-bp paired-end reads. The pool was loaded at 200 pM (normalized to 1 nM pre-denaturation), with 1% PhiX spiked in as a sequencing control. The base-call files were demultiplexed through the Harvard BPF Genomics Core pipeline and the resulting fastq files were used in subsequent analysis. Raw RNA-sequencing data in FASTQ format were subjected to quality assessment using FastQC (v.0.11.9) and sequencing reads were aligned to mouse genome (mm10) using a STAR aligner&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 79" title="Dobin, A. et al.

The total hippocampal RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Ambion, 15596018) and purified using a Direct-zol RNA Mini Prep kit (Zymo Research, R2050) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Genes were deemed expressed if at least &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 9 samples (where &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is the group size) had more than one count per million (CPM). Genes not satisfying these criteria were removed, keeping the original library sizes.

The final normalized and adjusted gene-expression values were derived from adding the regression residuals to the estimated effect of the group level to preserve the effect of the group on expression.

The specified number of unwanted factors (RUVr covariates) used in final analyses were then estimated by the RUVr function using log(CPM) expression values and the residuals. The number of unwanted factors was selected based on separation of groups in PC plots using normalized and adjusted gene-expression values and checking that histograms of differential expression &lt;i&gt;P &lt;/i&gt;values showed a uniform or anti-conservative pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec51"&gt;Differential expression and gene set enrichment analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differential expression analysis between groups with covariate adjustment using the covariates listed above was performed for expressed genes using edgeR (estimateDisp, glmFit and glmLRT with default arguments) in R.

Hippocampal homogenates from Li-deficient and control 3xTg mice containing an equal amount (100 µg) of protein were reduced with 200 mM tris[2-carboxyethyl] phosphine (TCEP) at 55 °C for 1 h, then alkylated with 375 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. Proteins were precipitated using the methanol/chloroform/water precipitation method and then digested with trypsin overnight at 37 °C. TMT labelling of digested samples was done according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher). In brief, TMT labelling reagents were dissolved with 41 µl anhydrous acetonitrile, and an equal volume of TMT reagent mix was added to each sample. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the reaction was quenched with 8 µl of 5% hydroxylamine. Equal amounts of peptides from each sample were combined and dried in a SpeedVac. The peptides were then separated using an Agilent 1200 HPLC system with a PolyWAX LP column (PolyLC), 200 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm and 300 A running under electrostatic repulsion–hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ERLIC) mode conditions. Peptides were separated across a 90-minute gradient from 0% buffer A (90% acetonitrile, 0.1% acetic acid) to 75% buffer B (30% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) with 20 fractions collected by time. Each fraction was dried in a SpeedVac and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid solution before analysis by mass spectrometry. Each ERLIC fraction was submitted for a single liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) experiment that was done on a Q Exactive HF-X High Resolution Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher) coupled with an Ultimate 3000 nanoLC (Thermo Fisher) at the Harvard Center for Mass Spectrometry. Peptides were first isolated on a trapping cartridge (300 µm × 5 mm PepMap Neo C18 trap cartridge, Thermo Scientific) before separation on an analytical column (µPAC, C18 pillar surface, 50-cm bed, Thermo Scientific). The LC gradient was as follows: 2–27% in mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) for 70 min and increased to 98% mobile phase B for 15 min at a flow rate of 300 nl min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The mass spectrometer operated in data-dependent mode for all analyses. Electrospray-positive ionization was enabled with a voltage of 2.1 kV. A full scan ranging from 400 to 1,600 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; was done with a mass resolution of 12 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and an automated gain control (AGC) target set to 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec55"&gt;Proteomics quality control&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top three most intensive precursor ions from each scan were used for MS2 fragmentation (normalized collision energy of 32) at a mass resolution of 3.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and an AGC of 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. The dynamic exclusion was set at 50 s with a precursor isolation window of 1.2 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;. Raw data were submitted for analysis in Proteome Discoverer 3.0 software (Thermo Scientific). The MS/MS data were searched against the UniProt reviewed &lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt; (mouse) database along with known contaminants, such as human keratins and common lab contaminants. Sequest HT searches were performed using the following guidelines: a 10-ppm MS tolerance and 0.02-Da MS/MS tolerance; trypsin digestion with up to two missed cleavages; carbamidomethylation (+57.021 Da) on cysteine, TMT 6-plex tags on peptide amino termini and lysine residue (+229.163 Da) were set as static modification; oxidation (+15.995 Da) of methionine was set as variable modification; minimum required peptide length was set to ≥6 amino acids. At least one unique peptide per protein group was required to identify proteins. Of 13,404 proteins identified, only &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3,392 proteins were identified with high confidence (MS2 spectra assignment, FDR &amp;lt; 0.01 on both protein and peptide level by applying the target-decoy database search by Percolator) and were included in the statistical analysis, as per the standard procedures of the Harvard Center for Mass Spectrometry&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Elias, J.

An ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test was used to assess differences in protein abundance between Li-deficient and control samples. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg method to control the FDR. Proteins with an adjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 were considered differentially abundant (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#MOESM9"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;).

              &lt;p&gt;More than a decade after Hurricane Sandy flooded the East Coast and killed over 200 people, a new study has revealed the storm’s lasting impact on mortality risk among older adults. The researchers linked hurricane flood exposure to a 9% increase in risk of death for people over the age of 65 who continued living in the area after landfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22838-1"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; that Hurricane Sandy caused over $60 billion in damage after it made landfall in 2012. Record-breaking storm surge and catastrophic flooding &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/news/oct17/sandy-five-years-later.html"&gt;inundated&lt;/a&gt; the coastlines of New York and New Jersey, destroying hundreds of thousands of homes. Over a decade later, affected communities have largely rebuilt, but the storm’s invisible impact on senior mortality risk endures, according to the new study. The findings, published Wednesday, August 6, in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1523941/full"&gt;Frontiers in Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, underscore the need to consider how natural disasters impact public health over the long term, particularly within vulnerable populations, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hurricanes and associated flooding and damage impact the lives of those around them; fixing homes, dealing with the stress associated with this all can have long-lasting impacts, which may be seen in terms of mortality,” Arnab Ghosh, senior author and assistant professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, told Gizmodo in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We also know from other data from hurricanes that the environment changes in areas that are impacted. Socially, people move away; economically, businesses close. These factors can also limit social networks and friendships, all of which are particularly important in older adults,” Ghosh added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues split the areas that were most affected—New York State, New Jersey, Connecticut, and New York City—into 959 zip code tabulation areas. ZCTAs are generalized representations of zip codes that public health researchers use to group demographic and health information by location. Of the 959 ZTCAs, 454 had flooded during Hurricane Sandy, and 505 were within a 10-mile (16-kilometer) radius of flooded areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers then analyzed health data from nearly 300,000 residents aged 65 or older who were enrolled in Medicare and continued to reside in the same zip code area from 2013 to 2017. To isolate the effects of hurricane-related flooding, they controlled for age, gender, race, and living circumstances, as well as other demographic and socioeconomic factors.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that Medicare beneficiaries who stayed in flooding-impacted ZCTAs had a significantly higher risk—9% on average—of death from all causes compared to those living in areas unaffected by flooding. That increase persisted for up to 5 years after the hurricane hit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Localized increases in mortality risk varied by region, but not in ways the researchers expected. Medicare beneficiaries living in flooded parts of Connecticut and New York City showed the greatest increases in risk of death: 19% and 8%, respectively. Ghosh and his colleagues were surprised to see that seniors living in affluent Connecticut fared worse than those living in New York City, where socioeconomic and demographic characteristics may result in greater exposure to natural disasters. Further research will need to investigate the reasons behind this, but Ghosh suspects it may be partly related to lack of hurricane preparedness in Connecticut, as this state rarely sees tropical storms.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;What’s more, hard-hit New Jersey and New York State did not show significant hurricane flooding-related effects on seniors’ all-cause mortality. “We were surprised by this finding,” Ghosh said. In New Jersey, this may be due to the fact that most coastal residences are single-family vacation homes, limiting the consequences of flood exposure, he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ghosh hopes that this data will aid disaster relief and preparedness efforts at the local and federal levels. Organizations need to think about not just the short-term outcomes but also the long-term health problems that stem from hurricanes, he said. “We certainly need more policies and infrastructure, particularly as hurricanes become more intense, [frequent], and dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Arnab Ghosh is an assistant professor of medicine at Cornell University. This affiliation was incorrect, and has been changed to Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As of Wednesday, the government reported there had been more than 7,000 cases, mostly in the southern manufacturing hub of Foshan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Here's what to know about chikungunya: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Chikungunya is a disease caused by a virus of the same name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The chikungunya virus was first identified in people sickened during an outbreak in Tanzania in 1952. Its name is derived from a word in the Makonde language, which means “that which bends up,” due to the severe pain it can cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Chikungunya is transmitted by infected mosquitoes and mostly causes mild symptoms. The majority of people who get chikungunya recover without needing medical attention after one to two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Chikungunya typically produces symptoms including fever, muscle pain, nausea, fatigue and a rash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But in rare cases, it can cause debilitating joint pain that persists for months or even years. Patients who get severely ill often require hospitalization because of the risk of organ damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The World Health Organization says severe cases and deaths are rare and mostly occur in babies or elderly people with underlying health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There is no specific treatment for chikungunya, but health workers can treat the symptoms by giving medicines to lower fevers or ease muscle pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Two vaccines have been approved in several regions, including Britain, Brazil, Canada and Europe. Those are mostly targeted at travelers and are not widely available in the countries most affected by chikungunya. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Chikungunya causes regular outbreaks in Africa, Asia and the Americas, with occasional small epidemics in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As of July, there have been about 240,000 cases of chikungunya, including 90 deaths in 16 countries, according to the European Centres for Disease Prevention and Control. The countries that reported the highest number of infections were Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina and Peru. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;An outbreak of chikungunya in Foshan, near Hong Kong, has prompted Chinese authorities to take measures like distributing mosquito nets, having workers spray residential areas, streets and construction sites with insecticide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;People who do not empty bottles, flower pots or other outdoor receptacles, where water might accumulate and allow mosquitoes to breed, can be subject to fines of up to 10,000 yuan ($1,400) and have their electricity cut off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The U.S. has issued a travel advisory telling citizens not to visit China’s Guangdong province, the location of Donguan and several other business hubs, along with countries such as Bolivia and island nations in the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Unusually heavy rains and high temperatures this year have worsened the crisis in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I was in a coma for six days last year, because I collapsed at home from pneumonia. I was sedated and intubated. I remember not feeling well, and needing to sleep in the recliner, then some blips, a ride in an ambulance, some very violent dreams and nightmares, then literally waking up during a nightmare about attending my own funeral. The nightmares were so real, I can still recount them in detail...it felt like lifetimes. Honestly, it changed a lot about how I view things."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"It took me around three days to re-orient to 2024, and that I hadn't died, and hadn't lost our younger son to violence. In fact, I only had one kid, anyway, and he was hale hearty and right there. For days, though, I was suspicious that people just didn't want to tell me that one of my two kids died, he had a name and everything. It was fucking terrifying. I had what they call 'coma dementia' for about 3–4 months after. I had to relearn everything: walking, talking, fine motor skills, everything. I couldn't even feed myself the first week, could basically only move my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have everything back; I worked really hard after that to get healthy and fix so many things. I feel lucky; I got to attend my own funeral, and came back from it. I always appreciated life, but after all that? I know it's cliche, but every day I wake up, I just fucking treasure it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1m4v0n2/those_who_have_been_into_coma_and_eventually_woke/n48xwvf/" target="_blank"&gt;Arachne93&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And it found a surprising pattern — the longer we put off doing something we enjoy, the &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; likely we are to continue putting it off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DOCUIM7WFZB7ZLPU5BDXFCXF6U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This may be because of the “psychological drama” we build up around the experience, suggested &lt;a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/o/ed-o-brien" target="_blank"&gt;Ed O’Brien&lt;/a&gt;, the study’s author and an associate professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SZ3YPXFHRJHGTA6A7KD4QGRSIU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s as if we believe that our first time back to, say, a favorite restaurant or reconnecting with a friend “shouldn’t be wasted.

&lt;p&gt;Nutrition is another key piece, though perhaps not as key as walking. According to the original study mentioned, researchers need more and consistent information on the most beneficial dietary factors and how different foods affect different biomarkers (the latter includes certain proteins, blood pressure and tumors, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it’s important to note that most current research looks at a combination of factors, not diet alone. “Pairing [walking] with nutrient-rich foods … gives the brain the building blocks it needs to stay resilient,” Zubkov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that said, knowledge about &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/11-foods-experts-say-can-boost-your-brain-health-and-help-ward-off-dementia-ano_l_66f567a8e4b064e1788b9cd3" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918143"&gt;brain-healthy foods&lt;/a&gt; does exist. The study found positive results with the MIND-diet, or the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay. It’s a hybrid of the Mediterranean diet and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) antihypertensive diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.barrowneuro.org/wp-content/uploads/MIND-Diet-1.pdf" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918143" data-affiliate="true"&gt;MIND-diet includes&lt;/a&gt; whole grains; dark, leafy, green vegetables; nuts; olive oil; berries; and even red wine, among other foods and beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zubkov recommended a few key nutrients: omega-3s, antioxidants and polyphenols. More specifically, he encouraged people to eat fatty fish, walnuts, leafy greens and berries, and to drink green tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there other ways to generate BDNF?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

The participants filled out a questionnaire on their health and diet at the start of the study, along with four questionnaires that looked at their diet from the past 24 hours during the 12-plus year study period.

Those include things like olive      oil and flour. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li data-node-id="12.5"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.5.0"&gt;Processed foods&lt;/strong&gt;: Processed      foods have been changed from their natural state, and typically include salt,      oil, and sugar. Cheeses and canned fish tend to fall into this category.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li data-node-id="12.7"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.7.0"&gt;Ultra-processed      foods: &lt;/strong&gt;Ultra-processed      foods are processed and include ingredients like artificial colors and      flavors. They also typically have preservatives added for shelf stability      and texture, and are usually packaged. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-are-ultra-processed-foods-linked-to-lung-cancer" data-node-id="13" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="13.0"&gt;Why are ultra-processed foods linked to lung cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s important to point out that the study didn’t prove that eating ultra-processed foods causes lung cancer. Instead, it found a link between people who have diets that are high in ultra-processed foods and a lung cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While the researchers adjusted the data for people who were smokers—a known risk factor for lung disease—it didn’t break down how much or how long people smoked, points out &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/nilesh-l-vora" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/nilesh-l-vora" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nilesh Vora, M.D.," data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Nilesh Vora, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an oncologist and medical director of the MemorialCare Todd Cancer Institute at Long Beach Medical Center in Long Beach, CA. It could simply be that people who smoke often are more likely to eat more ultra-processed foods, and that the smoking (not the food) is what raised the risk, he explains. &lt;strong data-node-id="15.3"&gt;Worth noting: People who were non-smokers who ate high levels of ultra-processed foods were also diagnosed with lung cancer in the study. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt; Still, experts say it’s possible that there is something about ultra-processed foods themselves that may raise the risk of developing lung cancer. “Although ultra-processed foods are not—yet—classified as carcinogens, both epidemiological and laboratory data suggest they may be a potential cancer risk factor,” says &lt;a href="https://www.moffitt.org/research-science/researchers/matthew-schabath/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.moffitt.org/research-science/researchers/matthew-schabath/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Matthew Schabath, Ph.D." data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Matthew Schabath, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at Moffitt Cancer Center. “Laboratory studies have shown that components of ultra-processed foods can alter gut microbiota, increase inflammation, damage DNA, and modify gene expression, among other effects. Diets high in ultra-processed foods also promote systemic inflammation and oxidative stress—both of which contribute to cancer development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The lack of nutrition in ultra-processed foods, contaminants from processing and packaging that may be carcinogenic, and additives that are often used with ultra-processed foods, like glutamate (an amino acid used in processed foods as a flavor enhancer) and carrageenan (an additive used to thicken and stabilize food), may also be an issue, according to Dr. Vora. The idea that packaging material and “unregulated glutamate” may raise the risk of lung cancer is “the most compelling” potential reason why someone may develop lung cancer from ultra-processed foods, Dr. Vora says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Many ultra-processed foods are also engineered products, points out &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/vmac/person/danxia-yu-phd" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.vumc.org/vmac/person/danxia-yu-phd" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Danxia Yu, Ph.D.," data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Danxia Yu, Ph.D.,&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “Ultra-processed foods are essentially industrial formulations that are extensively processed to be high in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium, while low in fiber and micronutrients,” Yu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Yu also flags the food additives, particularly emulsifiers and preservatives, as being potentially problematic, along with chemicals from food packaging. Ultra-processed foods have been shown to impact blood sugar and the gut microbiome, as well as raise chronic inflammation, which is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11592557/"

class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; with a host of serious diseases, including cancer, she points out.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Still, Yu stresses that it’s hard to draw too many conclusions from this study. “Although there is biological plausibility and epidemiological evidence linking ultra-processed foods to disease risk like the results from this study, we cannot conclude that ultra-processed foods cause lung cancer,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Schabath agrees. “The study is one of the first cohort studies to identify an association between ultra-processed food consumption and lung cancer risk,” he says. “That said, the limited evidence doesn’t mean there’s no association—just that more research is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-cut-back-on-ultra-processed-foods" data-node-id="22"

class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While doctors stress that the link between ultra-processed foods and lung cancer is still being explored, a growing body of research suggests that it’s still best to limit how much of this food category you eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you’re interested in eating fewer ultra-processed foods, it’s helpful to focus on more nutrient-dense foods first, says Scott Keatley, R.D., co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink"

Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. “Ultra-processed foods become a problem when they displace the fiber, protein, and micronutrients our bodies need to regulate inflammation and repair cells,” he says. “It’s not about swearing off convenience, it’s about making room for foods that do more for you.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To start, it’s best to build your meals around whole ingredients like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts, and lean proteins, says Keri Gans, R.D.N., author of &lt;em

			&lt;p&gt;Signs of a rogue immune system may be present more than a decade before the debilitating physical symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) reveal themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study found poor mental health may be one of the earliest hints of this disease, which impacts about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-research-may-explain-how-this-virus-can-cause-multiple-sclerosis-in-some-people"&gt;2.8 million people globally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of British Columbia epidemiologist Marta Ruiz-Algueró and colleagues investigated the medical histories of 2,038 patients with MS in Canada and compared them to 10,182 patients without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-balance-of-gut-bacteria-could-play-a-crucial-role-in-how-ms-develops"&gt;A Balance of Gut Bacteria Could Play a Crucial Role in How MS Develops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found patients who went on to develop MS had presented to their physicians with symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, dizziness, anxiety, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="170022" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; more often than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, these clues appeared as early as 15 years before more established symptoms were first detected. &lt;span&gt;The researchers also identified a spike in visits to neurologists and ophthalmologists around 8 to 9 years before their diagnosis. This was then followed by a surge of visits for physical symptoms in the lead-up to diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're only now starting to understand what these early warning signs are, with mental health-related issues appearing to be among the earliest indicators," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2025/08/ms-early-signs/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Ruiz-Algueró.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These patterns suggest that MS has a long and complex prodromal phase – where something is happening beneath the surface but hasn't yet declared itself as MS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of poor mental health are common throughout the population, the researchers caution, and most people who experience them will not go on to develop MS. Still, if we can better understand how such signs relate to MS, it may become possible to identify risk factors and earlier interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"MS can be difficult to recognize as many of the earliest signs – like fatigue, headache, pain, and mental health concerns – can be quite general and easily mistaken for other conditions," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2025/08/ms-early-signs/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; University of British Columbia epidemiologist Helen Tremlett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune systems of people with MS mistakenly attack their nerves' fatty protective coating, called the myelin sheath. This can eventually lead to pain, loss of sensation, and loss of motor function in different parts of the body, as the connection between the body and the brain becomes compromised. Fatigue, vision disturbances, and cognitive dysfunction are also common symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170024" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170024" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GettyImages-530457339.jpg" alt="Diagram of neuron damage in MS" class="wp-image-170024 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GettyImages-530457339.jpg 722w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GettyImages-530457339-642x429.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GettyImages-530457339-620x415.jpg 620w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GettyImages-530457339-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170024" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The impact multiple sclerosis has on nerves.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Takuya Karasawa, an expert in diabetes and metabolism at the University of Utah and study co-author, added: 'It's unlikely that the observed lean mass loss represents a serious adverse effect.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers found Ozempic-induced weight loss decreased lean muscle mass in mice by around 10 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But skeletal muscles shrunk by only around six per cent. By contrast, muscle from other tissue like the liver shrunk by nearly half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers then tested the amount of force the mice's muscles exerted and discovered that some muscle strength decreased as the mice lost weight, even when the size of the muscle stayed roughly the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/abstract/S1550-4131(25)00331-6"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists said this potential loss of strength when taking Ozempic could be a particular concern for adults over the age of 60 who are at a higher risk of muscle loss and reduced mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katsu Funai, a professor of nutrition at the University of Utah and study co-author, added: 'The loss of physical function is a strong predictor of not just quality of life but longevity.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts, who weren't involved in the research, however said the findings need to be taken with 'huge helpings of caution'.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Lora Heisler, chair of human nutrition at the University of Aberdeen, said: 'What is still an open question is whether the small degree of muscle loss observed in some patients taking Wegovy or similar medicines influences muscle strength or performance. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The study suggests that it might do in mice, but there needs to be huge helpings of caution taken alongside this as this study was conducted in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The change in muscle function was only found in one type of muscle, and consistently found with one dose of drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Therefore, further research studies are needed in humans to understand the impact of Wegovy and other similar medications on muscle loss, strength, and performance.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At least half a million &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-5e5593b0-f855-11ef-8279-ffcfdae8d660"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; patients and some 15million patients in the US are now thought to be using weight-loss jabs, which can help patients lose up to 20 per cent of their body weight in just a few months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the numbers using them privately are even higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under official guidelines, only patients who have a body mass index (BMI) of over 35 and at least one weight-related health problem like high blood pressure, or those who have a BMI of 30 to 34.9 and meet the criteria for referral to a specialist weight management service, should be prescribed weight loss jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, law forbids the sale of such drugs without a prescription from a medical professional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 11:50:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQNUNyV0lZZ3hHRkFxNzhkdVpEVHlSekVxMnBUTzU4eGVrMEV4RlBFbWJTS0trUkpFY0dtVVp5SFRHQXFGcWxFS2NtR1FKOXdBWlBvMGw2TW9BcW5CTnRYWV9TZWdHTXJINDZrT2E4alVxeGJKbzRQZlBSMUlkTmxvcG8tWUlzZnpkVnc2dXMxQW5rSUdCX3B5aFU4ckpCeEsxLU4wWHE1b0hYNXd0OGJFcWNn0gG3AUFVX3lxTE9hSVllZkxZdTZqeEhPeGZ4M0dhWlhsQzFtYkFSOTRjY0xHQkNuN2M0M3hBVGJqV1JqMnFGR2psX2llVkF3MTlOOTRQdTdOVkgyUmJoU18yVzhhZ29vdUh0SVlmZlVXRTNQOTJMeE15bmlIbW5uSkM2dnRXUHpWeVdSYVhlWl91T3FobkhzT2Z3R0FpaEJqT0ZSTkQ1YVFucVRLeDNROWtwemhLYkJXRFNKS2xKdlE2QQ</guid></item><item><title>44年的研究表明，骑自行车可以将痴呆风险降低88 ％ -汤姆指南</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxPbC1xRGxvdUJKSUVfMDRZYnVzOHRUN3cxdTc5VHI5dHlIRE4wYUhFbW40ODZNYXRZcG83WHZtdjJnbks3VHNySjR5cU1ZSmUyNzVwTXdaT2tCYlhnQVNQZ1BSVWQzcEpLTm8wWTlROU5WVXYtb3AwRjhWRVFOalF1d3RsMHRwbzhUQ3oyWW1jemtTMUx1U0FqQ1hvMEZvdnN6S3Y5dVQ5YkduVHZRV2xqdWlGQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting older is inevitable, but there’s been a host of studies that prove regular exercise is one of the best ways to future-proof your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data shows that women make up two thirds of dementia cases globally, with the loss of estrogen during menopause increasing the risk of the most common types of dementia. Yet a 44-year study, published in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29540588/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29540588/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has &lt;strong&gt;linked cycling to long-term brain protection&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-the-study-shows-3"&gt;What the study shows&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study looked at a sample of 1462 women aged 38 to 60. At the start of the study, between 1968-1970, 191 of the women completed a maximal cycling test on a stationary bike. They performed various cycling intervals, cycling at a low intensity, and increasing the intensity every few minutes until they reached exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their peak workload achieved at exhaustion was recorded. This was measured in watts, and researchers used it as a marker for their maximal cardiovascular fitness level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded that high fitness delayed the age of dementia onset by 9.5 years, and that the women who demonstrated high cardio fitness had an 88% lower risk of developing dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women in the study were then examined for signs of dementia in 1974, 1980, 2000, 2005, and 2009. This included neuropsychiatric examinations, interviews with the women, and hospital records. The researchers also looked at socioeconomic factors, like income and education, as well as the women’s diets, smoking habits, and any existing illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that only 5% of the highly fit women, based on the scores in the cycling tests at the beginning of the study, developed dementia, compared to 32% in the moderate group. The researchers concluded that high fitness delayed the age of dementia onset by 9.5 years, and that the women who demonstrated high cardio fitness had an 88% lower risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-get-started-with-cycling-3"&gt;How to get started with cycling &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not into cycling, or you don’t have the space to install one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-exercise-bikes" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-exercise-bikes"&gt;best exercise bikes&lt;/a&gt; in your home, don’t panic. Building cardiovascular fitness can be achieved through swimming, running, and even fast walking, so it’s not just biking that holds memory-boosting benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sszGckW5obZpePWguHkjaF" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sszGckW5obZpePWguHkjaF slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, while this is an impressive longitudinal study, there are limitations — for example, the women classified as “highly fit” are likely to have a better diet and healthier habits. What’s more, the study only looked at Swedish women. More research is needed into the subject, but staying fit and healthy as you get older is definitely beneficial for your physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide on Google News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get our up-to-date news, how-tos, and reviews in your feeds.

Screen time included either watching TV or using electronic devices. Cardiometabolic health data measured cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, waist measurements, blood pressure and insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Each additional hour of screen time was associated with higher cardiometabolic risk for both kids and teenagers. Teenagers with excess screen time were especially at risk. Additionally, the risk was heightened for kids and teenagers reporting fewer hours of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This study helps bolster our confidence in the finding that screen time in youth can adversely impact cardiometabolic health," Dr. Amanda Marma Perak, chair of the American Heart Association's Young Hearts Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Committee, and an assistant professor of pediatrics and preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, wrote in a statement to ABC news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Previous long-term studies have confirmed a link between cardiovascular disease in adulthood and higher screen time in teens. But this is the first study that looked at associations between cardiometabolic risk and screen time for both kids and teens, Perak noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, this does not imply that excess screen time directly affects cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This was still an observational study showing correlation rather than an experiment showing causation," Perak wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Another limitation of the study was a lack of distinguishing between screen time used for educational purposes versus more passive screen time like scrolling through social media or texting with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Other studies have suggested that it's the more passive screen time -- like watching TV for older generations, and scrolling social media for today's youth -- that is probably most detrimental, Perak wrote. "On the other hand, more active screen use -- like looking up new information, creating things (like videos or online illustrated books), or communicating (like FaceTime) with friends and family -- may not adversely impact heart health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study highlights the importance of jointly considering screen time and sleep patterns for promoting cardiovascular health in kids and teens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Perak pointed out that youth who spend more time glued to their screens tend to have worse heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"And secondarily, the combination of more time on screens plus going to bed late and/or not getting enough sleep appears to be more harmful for heart health," she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Perak added that she'd like to see more studies to understand the impact screen time may have on long-term cardiovascular health in more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Dr. Jennifer Miao is a board-certified cardiologist, critical care and interventional cardiology fellow at Yale School of Medicine/YNHH, and a fellow with the ABC News' Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 11:15:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPWEtmc3VzdGxpWkJ5X0ttVFJJSFlyal9XblJWZVgxcWU4ZzZQNGY3X1V1d0hDUEY4V2IwR203c1RITDhVZGlVa3lKOHZ5eFJQMXRUTXVOSkxGaWdNYzhRclpKcG52TWtGMXdQcmV6dncxOUxDa2JfME9pdnQzUVBseFJBYWR1TE1vU1hwdklaY0JRemxha1BEcNIBngFBVV95cUxPakRfaWR6dFBmM2JyRXZFRVNwWUNqYk9UOVA2T2Q4WER5YVVnZWJmaGZYcDdhc3Q4bEh1MTdndVR0NzZaaTVhTW9Qd0ZVY3hSRlFiQjhadHZZRkNhcndvRC1VdDI2YmJiU3FpaEZuaFdGaldCdGZQTXJOWjBoWlByTjByX3YwdDc2TTdSWjFzV0RnOTFYWlBjWWpkUV9tdw</guid></item><item><title>爸爸惊讶地发现口交导致癌症后以为他从健身房跑了下来- LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxQZ25wcW56a09Id2xoNmhYNjY2ZjVwSjV1anhha2tKbjRENXlLdEJlNDlZSGdiMWhNWm9YT0hhdnpwOVVibWJYbEliLVFRa29SZ2FLN0NxN2VrTFRmcVdsNV9oYWxJZWVRbHFoWlNWN1YxQ0JFYlNVVWtJRmdIMGNGR1FUejZaZXdLcnJodnhxWk5xMDBMY3pWcG83dUdaZzFvOEtuZVNB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A father-of-two was left floored after doctors informed him a suspicious-looking lump in his throat was cancer - which they believe was caused by oral sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Frank Lane said he initially thought that &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; experts were 'talking a load of rubbish' when they informed him of the intimate source of his illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But after doing some of his own research into &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/warning-sex-act-rise-in-mouth-cancer-574275-20241115"&gt;the link between cunnilingus and mouth cancer&lt;/a&gt;, he realised that the multiple flings he had in his early 20s might be to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The HGV driver, from Basingstoke, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/uk-news"&gt;Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, explained that his ordeal first began when he noticed a firm lump in his neck which was 'the size of a boiled egg' two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I was having a shave, felt my neck and thought 'that feels a bit hard'," Frank said.

It is thought the virus may &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/oral-sex-bigger-risk-throat-cancer-doctor-tiktok-803218-20231103"&gt;have a similar effect on the cells of the throat&lt;/a&gt;, although further research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The 60-year-old received the diagnosis after a lump appeared in his neck (Kennedy News and Media)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;HPV typically does not cause any symptoms, and most people who have it don't even realise, as it can take decades for it to develop into something more sinister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/human-papilloma-virus-and-cancer"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; the World Health Organisation, it usually takes 15-20 years for cervical cancer to develop after the initial HPV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Frank, who was in the Royal Corps of Signals for 12 years, said he was told that his biopsy results suggested he'd contracted the virus up to 40 years earlier, when he was just 20 and sexually active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I was having fun, but I wasn't messing about with loads of different girls," he said of his younger years. "When they said I had throat cancer, I thought he was talking a load of rubbish for a split second because I'd stopped smoking 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"[When he said] you've got throat cancer from oral sex...it was a surprise. When I got told, I was thinking 'f*ck that, I'm never doing it again'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;He explained that some of his work colleagues 'laughed' and didn't believe him when he told them about the source of his cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The dad has now got the all clear after undergoing treatment (Kennedy News and Media)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I told them to &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; it and I saw the colour drain from their faces," Frank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In January last year, the dad underwent two rounds of chemotherapy at Henley Hospital in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As this unfortunately didn't touch the tumour, doctors recommended a gruelling six-week course of radiotherapy that blasted the cancer - which he described as the 'most painful thing he's ever experienced in his life'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Now, 16 months on from completing treatment, Frank has got the all clear and is checked over every two months to ensure he's still on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Sharing some tongue-in-cheek advice for others, he laughed: "My advice would be don't have oral sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"For anyone who can't follow that, my advice would be if you have any unusual symptoms don't ignore them, get it checked out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 10:20:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQZ25wcW56a09Id2xoNmhYNjY2ZjVwSjV1anhha2tKbjRENXlLdEJlNDlZSGdiMWhNWm9YT0hhdnpwOVVibWJYbEliLVFRa29SZ2FLN0NxN2VrTFRmcVdsNV9oYWxJZWVRbHFoWlNWN1YxQ0JFYlNVVWtJRmdIMGNGR1FUejZaZXdLcnJodnhxWk5xMDBMY3pWcG83dUdaZzFvOEtuZVNB</guid></item><item><title>救命！我的家人在看到我的戏剧性转变时会失去理智。呃，不太好。-石板</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxQWjJYczVhNUlzbm1NRVhIUE5nR3EtMXlVNXNhTnFob3J5UDNHYUlGcGpSTEYtMzNNZldURndXcDhYOXRFYVVLWnVGYktrRTV4aGhOSldBTUF5X2tfWnJHZDctWnV1Z2x1a1BnSUNHRUJpeERJQm40Z1pwd3RBOWcwN3B1ZnNUa19RODloVktNVzA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxbnuwz00133b79itodnp3a@published"&gt;I’ve had a very eventful year. At the beginning of 2025, my long-term relationship ended, and after a few months, I decided to move out of state.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxmdr2q00143b79qww2ngus@published"&gt;Just before moving, I started a GLP-1 weight loss drug, and I have successfully lost most of the pandemic weight I’d been packing on (yay!). The problem is I’m flying back to my hometown for a visit soon, and I’m quite sure my visible weight loss will be an uncomfortable topic of conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="162" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxmpjql001v3b7925puj50k@published"&gt;My mom has suffered from undiagnosed eating disorders since I was a child, and my aunt, who I’m very close to, is a bit of a fitness and health nut. My aunt has made negative comments about weight loss drugs, suggesting people should “just get off the couch and exercise.” Because of the way my mom and aunt have always talked about fatness and weight loss, I very much do not want to talk to them about my body or disclose that I lost the weight via a GLP-1 drug. I’m otherwise pretty open about my journey to friends who ask. I think it’s helpful for people to know the drugs do work (at least for me!) and don’t think everyone can lose weight via willpower alone, as I certainly couldn’t. What do you think the best approach will be to talk about it as little as possible with my family? I’m anticipating compliments and questions about how I lost the weight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="10" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxbnv0x00153b79g202s6iv@published"&gt;—I Was Pretty (and Fit!) When I Was Fat, Too&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxbnv4v00173b79gf9vembn@published"&gt;You are feeling good about your body and health, and you’re visiting people whom you love (even if you might not always like everything about them that much). This&lt;em&gt; should&lt;/em&gt; be a good time. So it’s really too bad that this upcoming visit is becoming a source of stress because of all of the baggage and judgment you’re going to have to navigate. It’s hard to have fun and difficult to connect with people when you’re on edge. How can you relax when you’re constantly bracing to hear a comment that will agitate you, chip away at your self-esteem, or take you right back to being a child, confused about why you’re hearing adults obsess over their bodies and the bodies of strangers?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="177" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxbnv7a00183b79v35chs0t@published"&gt;I definitely understand that you want to avoid feeling that way. And if you really think the best way forward is to avoid any conversations about your body, you should warn your mom and aunt before you show up. They’ve been obsessing out loud about weight for your entire life, so it’s only fair to give them some time to adjust to the idea that their typical remarks will be unwelcome. Here’s a text to send to the two of them: “Hi Mom and Aunt Barbara, I can’t wait to see you! I wanted to give you a heads up that when you see me, you’re probably going to notice that I’ve lost a few pounds. I know we’ve always talked about weight a lot, but lately, having a lot of attention on the way my body has changed has made me uncomfortable, so I’d rather not discuss it at all. I thought I’d let you know before I arrived. Thanks for understanding, and of course, we’ll have a lot of other things to catch up on!”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxbnv9800193b79m1j47d8p@published"&gt;But I have to say, banning discussion of your weight loss might shine even more of a spotlight on the change. Putting the topic in a category all to itself sort of elevates it to something with special importance. It gives it a lot of energy. And you’re still going to be acutely aware of what they’re noticing, what they’re thinking, and what they’re talking about when you leave. So I wonder if you’d be willing to engage in a brief exchange in which you take control of the narrative instead, responding to any remarks and pointedly— but still breezily and briefly—setting a new tone. Using this approach could go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxbnvb9001a3b795kli5ytt@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mom: &lt;/strong&gt;Wow, you’ve lost weight!&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You: &lt;/strong&gt;I have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mom:&lt;/strong&gt; You look great! I’m so happy for you! I need to lose more, too. I’m on this new diet where you just eat between the hours of—&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You: &lt;/strong&gt;Thanks, I do feel good in my body now, but I also felt good before, and I know my weight could always change again, so I’m trying not to obsess over it. It just feels sad to think about diets and food all the time. Anyway! Something more exciting that’s going on in my life right now is…&lt;/p&gt;

But I hope doing it your way made you &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;happy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of California, Irvine have identified a promising nonpharmaceutical treatment that rejuvenates aging brain cells and clears away the buildup of harmful proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a paper published in the journal &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-025-01786-4" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;GeroScience&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the UC Irvine team reports that a combination of naturally occurring compounds—nicotinamide (a form of vitamin B3) and epigallocatechin gallate (a green tea antioxidant)—can reinstate levels of guanosine triphosphate, an essential energy molecule in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tests on neurons in a dish, the treatment reversed age-related cellular deficits and improved the brain cells' ability to clear damaging amyloid protein aggregates, an Alzheimer's hallmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As people age, their brains show a decline in neuronal energy levels, which limits the ability to remove unwanted proteins and damaged components," said lead author Gregory Brewer, adjunct professor of biomedical engineering at UC Irvine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that restoring energy levels helps neurons regain this critical cleanup function."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor called GEVAL to track live guanosine triphosphate levels in neurons from aged Alzheimer's model mice. They discovered that free GTP levels declined with age—particularly in mitochondria, the cells' energy hubs—leading to impaired autophagy, the process by which cells eliminate damaged components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when aged neurons were treated for just 24 hours with nicotinamide and epigallocatechin gallate, GTP levels were restored to those typically seen in younger cells. This revival triggered a cascade of benefits: improved &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/energy+metabolism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;energy metabolism&lt;/a&gt;; activation of key GTPases involved in cellular trafficking, Rab7 and Arl8b; and efficient clearance of amyloid beta aggregates. Oxidative stress, another contributor to neurodegeneration, was also reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"This study highlights GTP as a previously underappreciated energy source driving vital brain functions," Brewer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By supplementing the brain's energy systems with compounds that are already available as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dietary+supplements/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dietary supplements&lt;/a&gt;, we may have a new path toward treating age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cautioned, "More work is going to be required to find the best way to administer this treatment, since a recent clinical trial involving UC Irvine researchers showed that oral nicotinamide was not very effective because of inactivation in the bloodstream."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brewer's collaborators were Ricardo Santana, a UC Irvine associate specialist in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/biomedical+engineering/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;biomedical engineering&lt;/a&gt;, and Joshua McWhirt, a UC Irvine junior specialist who's now a Ph.D. candidate at the Medical University of South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Screen time doesn't just affect &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/teens-4-hours-screen-time-anxiety-depression/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It may also take a toll on the physical health of &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/groundbreaking-study-examines-effects-of-screen-time-on-kids-60-minutes/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;children and teens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, according to new research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.12.24310353" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, the research found 10- and 18-year-olds who spent more time focused on devices, including phones, televisions, computers and gaming consoles, were at higher risk for cardiometabolic diseases, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and insulin resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used data from more than 1,000 participants in two Danish studies. Researchers gave a score to each participant representing their risk for the diseases compared to the average risk of the group, measured in standard deviations, with 0 meaning average risk and 1 meaning one standard deviation above average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each extra hour of screen time increased the patient's overall risk by about 0.08 standard deviations in 10-year-olds and by 0.13 standard deviations in 18-year-olds, the study's authors said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a small change per hour, but when screen time accumulates to three, five or even six hours a day, as we saw in many adolescents, that adds up," lead author David Horner, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found 18-year-olds were on devices about 6 hours a day, on average, while 10-year-olds averaged 3 hours a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found sleep impacted the results, with both less sleep and later bedtimes amplifying the relationship between screen time and heart health risks. That suggests screen time may harm health by "stealing" time from sleep, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Limiting discretionary screen time in childhood and adolescent may protect long-term heart and metabolic health," Horner said. "Our study provides evidence that this connection starts early and highlights the importance of having balanced daily routines." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was observational, meaning it found associations rather than proved cause and effect. It also had some limitations, including that participants self-reported screen time, which might not accurately reflect how much time they were actually on devices. &lt;/p&gt;

But it really isn’t the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over eight months, as part of a project funded by the Grantham Foundation, Macpherson and colleagues spoke to dozens of researchers, non-profit leaders, entrepreneurs and investors, and analysed hundreds of scientific papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to the DSV report, more than 3,600 synthetic chemicals from food contact materials – the materials that are used in food preparation and packaging – alone are found in human bodies, 80 of which are of significant concern. Pfas “forever chemicals”, for example, have been found in nearly all humans tested, and are now so ubiquitous that in many locations even rainwater contains levels regarded as unsafe to drink. Meanwhile, more than 90% of the global population breathes air that breaches World Health Organization (WHO) pollution guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When these chemicals contaminate our bodies, the results can be disastrous. The report found there were correlational or causal data linking widely used chemicals with threats to human reproductive, immune, neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, liver, kidney and metabolic systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“One of the main things that came out quite strongly was links between pesticide exposure and reproductive issues,” said Macpherson. “We saw quite strong links – correlation and causation – for miscarriage and people basically struggling to conceive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The DSV research adds to previous &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/23/earth-breach-planetary-boundaries-health-check-oceans" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;findings by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research&lt;/a&gt; that we have already far exceeded the safe planetary boundary for environmental pollutants, including plastics. On Sunday, another report warned that the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/03/world-in-15tn-plastics-crisis-hitting-health-from-infancy-to-old-age-report-warns" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;world faces a “plastics crisis”&lt;/a&gt;, which is causing disease and death from infancy to old age amid a huge acceleration of plastic production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The report also highlights critical shortcomings in current toxicity assessment, research and testing methods, exposing the ways in which existing checks and balances are failing to protect human and planetary health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The way that we’ve generally done the testing has meant that we’ve missed a lot of effects,” Macpherson said. He singled out the assessment of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which are substances that interfere with hormones, causing problems ranging from infertility to cancer. These have been found to confound the traditional assumption that lower doses will invariably have lesser effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“One of the things is that when you have a chemical which is interfering with the endocrine system, it sometimes has a nonlinear response. So you’ll see that there’ll be a response at a very low dose, which you wouldn’t be able to predict from its behaviour at a high dose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;DSV describes itself as a “venture creator” that spins out companies aimed at tackling big problems in environmental and human health issues. Part of the purpose of the report is to identify problem areas that can be tackled by innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-13" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;The planet's most important stories.

He cooks with a cast-iron skillet. He especially avoids heating food in plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Unfortunately, it is a recommendation to eat more organic food, but it is more expensive in general. So at least washing fruit and vegetables before eating them, but organic if you can afford it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxPb21fTDdaVkpyUnFNcDRXSGRlbFN0YjVHT01NLWdvQlFIdktoa0lRWXZtZUVJRVF1aE93RDE0N2lDbFNROTMxOGNGVlJ3c3AzWEtUWHdOZURaTTFFTmVtNG9uN3VEZlZ0dV94a0NaUzJ1YjJXTkFmOEdBZld6MDNWN0xQYS1hUU1YRmVIMGdiY242MlFXMHJKZy04WnJjOU9xVDZQcXJvakMyMzBtRkxraS1kOVFZbVlacmlROVlwQzJ6b3lmejU3MXhQeXI3NVU</guid></item><item><title>随着基孔肯雅热疫情在中国和世界各地蔓延，美国发布旅行警报--Axios</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxOZ0RoOW1RUnZORHhhQ2VhZEhjMGFRVGF5Sy1MWWF3M1pUeTFoQzVWNlFUZmxCa0UybGVvMlJBbEM5N2ltMXdXWWxWOE56cF90cWZYLVVQSkZLdEVkWXpfZHVQYlJsT0hQa1JGRjNPWXJrdjZlOUZwWHhUZi01Y29mUjQ1M3VGcHlqUlpfbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 02:27:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxOZ0RoOW1RUnZORHhhQ2VhZEhjMGFRVGF5Sy1MWWF3M1pUeTFoQzVWNlFUZmxCa0UybGVvMlJBbEM5N2ltMXdXWWxWOE56cF90cWZYLVVQSkZLdEVkWXpfZHVQYlJsT0hQa1JGRjNPWXJrdjZlOUZwWHhUZi01Y29mUjQ1M3VGcHlqUlpfbw</guid></item><item><title>什么是基孔肯雅病毒，中国等国家如何应对？ -半岛电视台</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"&gt;&lt;p data-start="72" data-end="243"&gt;United States health officials are urging travellers to &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/chikungunya-china" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;remain vigilant&lt;/a&gt; as a mosquito-borne virus continues to circulate across parts of Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="245" data-end="439"&gt;Since the beginning of 2025, there have been approximately 240,000 &lt;a href="/news/2024/10/24/chikungunya-surge-in-pakistan-what-we-know-about-the-mosquito-borne-virus"&gt;chikungunya virus&lt;/a&gt; infections and 90 deaths in 16 countries, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 4 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 1 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 2 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 3 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 4 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-start="441" data-end="671"&gt;In China, an outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/consensus_statement_on_the_prevention_and_control_of_chikungunya_fever_in_hong_kong_aug2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has infected&lt;/a&gt; roughly 7,000 people since late June, with most cases concentrated in the city of Foshan, in Guangdong province, just north of Hong Kong. This marks the country’s largest chikungunya outbreak since the virus was first identified there in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="193"&gt;Here is what we know about the disease and how it is spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-chikungunya-virus" data-start="0" data-end="193"&gt;What is the chikungunya virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya is a viral disease that is spread through the bite of infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. These mosquitoes also carry and spread dengue, yellow fever and the Zika virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name, chikungunya, derives from a word in the Kimakonde language, spoken in Tanzania and Mozambique, meaning “to become contorted”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In most cases, patients will feel better within a week. In many cases, however, the joint pain can last for months or even years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no cure for the chikungunya virus, but deaths are rare. If an infected mosquito bites a healthy human, it injects the virus into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="55" data-end="214"&gt;People most at risk of serious illness from chikungunya include newborns, older adults and those with existing health problems such as heart disease or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="216" data-end="268"&gt;There is no cure for the chikungunya virus, but the death rate is low, except in high-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-newsletter-slot" data-testid="article-newsletter-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="216" data-end="268"&gt;If an infected mosquito bites a healthy human, it injects the virus into the bloodstream. If a non-infected mosquito bites a person who is already infected, it sucks the virus from that person’s blood and becomes a carrier capable of transmitting the virus to others through bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3270421 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Interactive_Chikungunya_October24_2024-01-1729771918.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="Interactive_Chikungunya_October24_2024-transmission" fetchpriority="low"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-bad-is-the-current-spread-of-the-virus"&gt;How bad is the current spread of the virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the current surge in cases began in early 2025, with major outbreaks in Indian Ocean Islands, including La Reunion, Mayotte and Mauritius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In La Reunion, more than 47,500 cases of chikungunya and 12 associated deaths were reported up to May 2025, with sustained high transmission across the island, according to the WHO. The ECDC also reports that as of July 18, there were more than 54,000 cases reported from La Reunion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is now the most serious chikungunya outbreak in La Reunion since the 2005–2006 epidemic, which saw an estimated 244,000 to more than 300,000 cases, and prompted large-scale public health efforts to control mosquito breeding and limit transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus has also spread to other countries, including Madagascar, Somalia and Kenya, and has shown signs of epidemic-level transmission in parts of Southeast Asia, as well as India, where financial capital Mumbai has seen a surge in cases since July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO has also raised concerns about the rising number of imported chikungunya cases in Europe. Since May 1, about 800 imported cases have been reported in mainland France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the ECDC, the Americas as a region have reported the highest number of chikungunya cases globally. As of mid-July 2025, the countries with the most cases in the region include Brazil (185,553), Bolivia (4,721), Argentina (2,836) and Peru (55).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, infections have been reported in at least 12 cities across southern Guangdong province, in addition to Foshan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities said that an “imported case triggered local transmission” in July, but did not specify where the infection originated. According to experts, rising global temperatures have led to warmer and wetter weather, allowing mosquitoes to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, on Saturday, Hong Kong &lt;a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/02/P2025080200897.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; its first case of chikungunya: a 12-year-old boy who developed a fever, rash and joint pain since July 31, after visiting Foshan.

At the same time, scientists are releasing large “elephant mosquitoes” – about 2cm (0.8 inches) long – whose larvae eat the smaller mosquitoes that spread the virus. Health experts hope these mosquito helpers will play an important role in stopping the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="138" data-end="270"&gt;According to a report by the BBC, residents of affected areas in China have been ordered to eliminate standing water in and around their homes – including in flowerpots, coffee machines and empty bottles. Noncompliance may result in fines of up to 10,000 yuan (approximately $1,400), and in more serious cases, people could face criminal charges for “obstructing the prevention of infectious diseases”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="987" data-end="1255"&gt;Citing local sources, The New York Times said that in some instances, infected residents in Foshan are being moved to “quarantine wards”, where they are kept behind mosquito nets and screens.

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Mark Jurkowitz  | Outer Banks Voice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of a WRAL report that a man has been hospitalized on the Outer Banks as the result of a Vibrio vulnificus infection, the Dare County Department of Health and Human Service (DCHHS) is reporting two known cases in the county and providing guidance on how to prevent potentially dangerous recreational water-related illnesses (RWIs).&lt;span id="more-340640"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-c184ecb16f807fdb29f1f18f87633242 outer-mobile-content-one" id="outer-c184ecb16f807fdb29f1f18f87633242"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first case reported to DCHSS was a Vibrio vulnificus infection that resulted from the individual swimming in the Croatan Sound with a cut on their forearm. That person was hospitalized from July 15-20 and then released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second case involves a patient who was hospitalized on July 28 and remains in the hospital with a Vibrio vulnificus infection. The infection occurred after that person waded into the Croatan Sound with an open would on the ankle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-2b2a66b20457769d15e375d9a3b63180 outer-mobile-content-top" id="outer-2b2a66b20457769d15e375d9a3b63180"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-8ae6e85b034530982705cee0128728aa outer-content-top" id="outer-8ae6e85b034530982705cee0128728aa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 5, the DCHSS also released this information on WRIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dare County Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services would like to remind the public of the importance of preventing recreational water-related illnesses (RWIs). RWIs are caused by germs or chemicals found in water bodies such as swimming pools, hot tubs, lakes, rivers, estuaries, and oceans. It is important to understand how to prevent these illnesses and enjoy water activities safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RWIs are infections that can be contracted by swallowing, breathing in, or having contact with contaminated water. The most common types of RWIs include gastrointestinal illnesses, skin infections, respiratory infections, and ear infections. These illnesses can be caused by various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-7fea93195e178a29f476e72043cff949 outer-mobile-content-mid" id="outer-7fea93195e178a29f476e72043cff949"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing what we traditionally see with recreational water illnesses during the summer. Our department will stay vigilant in surveillance, but we are experiencing nothing out of the ordinary for this time of year in a coastal environment,” said Sheila Davies, Director of DCHHS. “It’s important to remember bacteria is naturally in the water, however, the risk of getting sick to the general public remains very low. Commercial fishermen, specifically crabbers, are at a higher risk due to the nature of their job. It is essential for all to follow water safety recommendations to help minimize the risk of developing water-related illnesses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-6c2d91bb9f6f9ac3b649e101529f4971 outer-content-mid" id="outer-6c2d91bb9f6f9ac3b649e101529f4971"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DCHHS recommends the following safety tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t swim if you’re sick.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have diarrhea or any other contagious illness, avoid swimming or entering any recreational water facilities. This will help prevent the contamination of water and the spread of germs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t swim if you have a compromised immune system or open wounds.&lt;/strong&gt; People with weakened immune systems should consult their healthcare provider before participating in recreational water activities, such as swimming. Open wounds such as cuts, scrapes, and recent tattoos can leave you more susceptible to illness. If you have a wound, including from a recent surgery, piercing, or tattoo, stay out of salt or brackish water, if possible. This includes wading at the beach. Cover your wounds with a waterproof bandage if it could come into contact with salt water, brackish water, or raw or undercooked seafood and its juices. Promptly tend to any wounds, cuts or abrasions you get while in or near the water. Thoroughly wash the wound with clean, drinkable water and soap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shower before swimming.&lt;/strong&gt; Take a quick shower with soap and water before entering the water. This helps remove any germs or contaminants on your body, reducing the risk of spreading them into the water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t swallow the water.&lt;/strong&gt; Avoid swallowing water while swimming or participating in water activities. Ingesting even a small amount of contaminated water can lead to illness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use proper hygiene practices.&lt;/strong&gt; Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after using the restroom or changing diapers. This is crucial in preventing the spread of germs to others and reducing the risk of contamination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change diapers in designated areas.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have young children who wear diapers, change them in designated diaper-changing areas and not near the water. Dispose of diapers properly to prevent contamination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep water clean.&lt;/strong&gt; If you own a pool or hot tub, maintain proper water chemistry and filtration systems. Regularly test the water and ensure it meets the recommended standards. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning and maintaining your pool or hot tub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid swimming in high-risk areas or situations.&lt;/strong&gt; Heavy rainfalls can wash contaminants into recreational water bodies, increasing the risk of RWIs. Wait at least 24-48 hours after heavy rainfall before swimming to allow the water to clear. Avoid swimming near ocean outfalls at all times. Marine or ocean outfalls discharge wastewater, stormwater, and other potentially contaminated waters to the sea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay informed.&lt;/strong&gt; Check for any local advisories or warnings regarding water quality before swimming or participating in water activities. Stay updated on any closures or restrictions in your area. Further information regarding advisories may be obtained from North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) by visiting their &lt;a href="https://www.deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/marine-fisheries/shellfish-sanitation-and-recreational-water-quality/recreational-water-quality"&gt;NC Recreational Water Quality Swimming Advisory Map&lt;/a&gt; or signing up to receive NCDEQ press releases on their  &lt;a href="https://www.deq.nc.gov/news/press-release?field_agency_department_target_id=1091"&gt;Water Quality Swimming Advisories&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teach children about water safety.&lt;/strong&gt; Educate children about the importance of not swallowing water, using proper hygiene practices, and following safety rules while swimming or playing in water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Report any water quality concerns.&lt;/strong&gt; If you notice any issues with water quality or suspect an outbreak of RWIs, report it to the appropriate authorities, such as North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, your local health department and/or pool operators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek medical care if you become ill.&lt;/strong&gt; If you get cut while in the sound or ocean, seek a doctor’s care if you become ill, a rash or swelling develops around the wound, or it appears infected.&lt;/li&gt;

The disease is caused by &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia typhi &lt;/i&gt;bacteria, which can be spread to humans when feces from infected fleas is rubbed into cuts or scrapes on the skin or into the eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., most cases of flea-borne typhus occur in Texas, California and Hawaii, with an average of about 300 cases each year nationwide, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Typhus.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;California Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease occurs year-round in areas of Los Angeles and Orange counties, but cases tend to &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/diseases/Typhus/Index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;peak during late summer and fall&lt;/a&gt; months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this year, 79 cases of flea-borne typhus —  confirmed, probable or suspected — have been reported in Los Angeles County, except for the cities of Long Beach and Pasadena, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/diseases/Typhus/Index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;county Public Health Department&lt;/a&gt;. For all of last year, the county had a total of 187 cases and it estimated 124 cases in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of Long Beach reported 20 cases as of July 31, a jump from 12 cases during the same period in 2024. On average the city has reported 20 cases each year, and “if this trend continues, Long Beach is expected to surpass its 2021 record of 28 cases reported in a single year,” according to the city’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.longbeach.gov/press-releases/city-of-long-beach-health-department-reports-increased-flea-borne-typhus-infections/" target="_blank"&gt;Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 75% of the people with the disease in Long Beach were hospitalized, and all have recovered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-is-at-risk-of-contracting-flea-borne-typhus" class="subhead"&gt;Who is at risk of contracting flea-borne typhus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In areas were the disease is prevalent, you are most at risk of getting typhus from infected fleas if you touch, pet or come into contact with rats, opossums and stray cats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the disease isn’t widespread in your neighborhood, public health experts say you should still stay away from animals that can carry the infected fleas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who live outdoors or in housing that is infested with rats or other rodents are also at risk of contracting the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-keep-the-fleas-and-disease-at-bay" class="subhead"&gt;How to keep the fleas and disease at bay&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;State and local public health experts provide the following guidance on how to prevent fleas from clinging onto your pet and keeping them out of your home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To keep infected fleas away from pets,&lt;/b&gt; keep them indoors and treat them regularly with flea control medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid attracting stray cats or rodents that are carrying infected fleas by&lt;/b&gt; keeping your trash cans covered at all times. Don’t leave trash or your pet food outside as that can entice animals to your home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t befriend or feed strays in your neighborhood &lt;/b&gt;that could be carriers of the infected fleas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prevent infected fleas or small animals from getting into or living on your property by&lt;/b&gt; clearing overgrown vegetation and clutter. If there are any openings or crawl spaces in your home, seal them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="these-are-the-symptoms-and-treatment-for-typhus" class="subhead"&gt;These are the symptoms and treatment for typhus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of flea-borne typhus include fever, headache, chills, muscle aches and a rash on or around the chest, sides and back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although rare, swelling can occur  in the lining of the brain (meningitis) or in the heart valves (endocarditis), according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Death due to the disease is uncommon, but it has occurred in Los Angeles County.

			&lt;p&gt;Centenarians, once considered rare, have become commonplace. Indeed, they are the &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/02/living-to-one-hundred-life-expectancy/"&gt;fastest-growing demographic group&lt;/a&gt; of the world's population, with numbers roughly doubling every ten years since the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long humans can live, and what determines a long and healthy life, have been of interest for as long as we know. Plato and Aristotle discussed and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12092789/"&gt;wrote about the ageing process&lt;/a&gt; over 2,300 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of understanding the secrets behind exceptional longevity isn't easy, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-turning-point-when-your-bodys-aging-accelerates"&gt;Study Reveals Turning Point When Your Body's Aging Accelerates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It involves &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105197/"&gt;unravelling the complex interplay&lt;/a&gt; of genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors and how they interact throughout a person's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now our recent study, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-023-00936-w"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; has unveiled some common biomarkers, including levels of cholesterol and glucose, in people who live past 90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonagenarians and centenarians have long been of intense interest to scientists as they may help us understand how to live longer, and perhaps also how to age in better health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, studies of centenarians have often been small scale and focused on a selected group, for example, excluding centenarians who live in care homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_103536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-103536" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp-642x260.jpg" alt="Old Woman Holds Her Young Photo Up" class="wp-image-103536 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-103536" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Dimitri Otis/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Huge dataset&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ours is the largest study comparing biomarker profiles measured throughout life among exceptionally long-lived people and their shorter-lived peers to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We compared the biomarker profiles of people who went on to live past the age of 100, and their shorter-lived peers, and investigated the link between the profiles and the chance of becoming a centenarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research included data from 44,000 Swedes who underwent health assessments at ages 64-99 - they were a sample of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28158674/"&gt;the so-called Amoris cohort&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_87621" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-87621" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/02/GeneticMutationImpressionWithGlowingCentreOfDNA-642x260.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-87621 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/02/GeneticMutationImpressionWithGlowingCentreOfDNA-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/02/GeneticMutationImpressionWithGlowingCentreOfDNA.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/02/GeneticMutationImpressionWithGlowingCentreOfDNA-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/02/GeneticMutationImpressionWithGlowingCentreOfDNA-600x243.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-87621" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Science Photo Library/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These participants were then followed through Swedish register data for up to 35 years. Of these people, 1,224, or 2.7%, lived to be 100 years old. The vast majority (85%) of the centenarians were female.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve blood-based biomarkers related to inflammation, metabolism, liver and kidney function, as well as potential malnutrition and anaemia, were included. All of these &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0719-5"&gt;have been associated&lt;/a&gt; with ageing or mortality in previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biomarker related to inflammation was uric acid – a waste product in the body caused by the digestion of certain foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also looked at markers linked to metabolic status and function including total cholesterol and glucose, and ones related to liver function, such as alanine aminotransferase (Alat), aspartate aminotransferase (Asat), albumin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (Alp) and lactate dehydrogenase (LD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also looked at creatinine, which is linked to kidney function, and iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), which is linked to anaemia. Finally, we also investigated albumin, a biomarker associated with nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_135978" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-135978" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_couple_ADRD-642x260.jpg" alt="older couple at beach" class="size-medium wp-image-135978" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_couple_ADRD-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_couple_ADRD-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_couple_ADRD-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_couple_ADRD.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-135978" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Studies of centenarians have often been small scale. (Halfpoint Images/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that, on the whole, those who made it to their hundredth birthday tended to have lower levels of glucose, creatinine and uric acid from their sixties onwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the median values didn't differ significantly between centenarians and non-centenarians for most biomarkers, centenarians seldom displayed extremely high or low values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, very few of the centenarians had a glucose level above 6.5 mmol/L earlier in life, or a creatinine level above 125 µmol/L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many of the biomarkers, both centenarians and non-centenarians had values outside of the range considered normal in clinical guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably because these guidelines are set based on a younger and healthier population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When exploring which biomarkers were linked to the likelihood of reaching 100, we found that all but two (alat and albumin) of the 12 biomarkers showed a connection to the likelihood of turning 100. This was even after accounting for age, sex and disease burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people in the lowest out of five groups for levels of total cholesterol and iron had a lower chance of reaching 100 years as compared to those with higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, people with higher levels of glucose, creatinine, uric acid and markers for liver function also decreased the chance of becoming a centenarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In absolute terms, the differences were rather small for some of the biomarkers, while for others the differences were somewhat more substantial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For uric acid, for instance, the absolute difference was 2.5 percentage points. This means that people in the group with the lowest uric acid had a 4% chance of turning 100 while in the group with the highest uric acid levels only 1.5% made it to age 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the differences we discovered were overall rather small, they suggest a potential link between metabolic health, nutrition and exceptional longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, however, does not allow any conclusions about which lifestyle factors or genes are responsible for the biomarker values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is reasonable to think that factors such as nutrition and alcohol intake play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping track of your kidney and liver values, as well as glucose and uric acid as you get older, is probably not a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, chance probably plays a role at some point in reaching an exceptional age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the fact that differences in biomarkers could be observed a long time before death suggests that genes and lifestyle may also play a role.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/215166/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;In a small randomized controlled trial, people lost twice as much weight when their diet was limited to minimally processed food compared to when they switched to a diet that included ultraprocessed versions of foods but was otherwise nutritionally matched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03842-0"&gt;published in Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at University College London, adds to a growing body of evidence that food processing, in addition to simple nutrition content, influences our weight and health. Ultraprocessed foods have already been vilified for their link to obesity—largely through weaker observational studies—but researchers have struggled to shore up the connection with high-quality studies and understand their impact on health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultraprocessed foods researchers provided in the new trial were relatively healthy ones—as ultraprocessed foods go. They included things like multigrain breakfast cereal, packaged granola bars, flavored yogurt cups, fruit snacks, commercially premade chicken sandwiches, instant noodles, and ready-made lasagna. But, in the minimally processed trial diet, participants received meals from a caterer rather than ones from a grocery store aisle. The diet included overnight oats with fresh fruit, plain yogurt with toasted oats and fruit, handmade fruit and nut bars, freshly made chicken salad, and from-scratch stir fry and spaghetti bolognese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the level of processing differed between the diets, the large-scale nutrition content—fat, protein, carbohydrates, fiber—were similar, as was the proportions of fruits, vegetables, dairy, and starchy food. Overall, both diets adhered to the dietary guidance from the UK government, called the Eatwell Guide (EWG).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diet processing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial had a crossover design, meaning that participants were randomly split to start out on either the ultraprocessed food (UPF) diet or the minimally processed food (MPF) diet. They stayed on their starter diet for eight weeks, then took a break, and switched to the other diet. For both diets, food was delivered directly to the participants' homes. Participants ate what they wanted and, mostly, didn't seem to cheat by sneaking other food, based on food diaries and reported adherence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty participants completed at least one diet, while 43 completed both diets. The participants were mostly women, with a mean age of 43, and all had a body mass index categorized as overweight or obesity. At the start of the trial, ultraprocessed foods made up, on average, nearly 70 percent of the participants' standard diets, and they were not adhering to the EWG recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

It helps people understand their pain, overcome fear of movement, and rebuild confidence through tailored physical activity and lifestyle coaching, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://info.thelancet.com/hubfs/Press%20embargo/CFTlowbackpain.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Researchers at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, and Perth, Australia's Curtin University followed over 300 adults with chronic lower back pain for three years across 20 physical therapy clinics in Australia. Study participants reported fewer pain symptoms at the end of the study after participating in just eight CFT sessions over six months, compared to those who used some other type of therapy to manage their back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Cognitive functional therapy is putting the patient in charge, addressing the person very holistically and looking at all the factors that are relevant,” said Dr. Mark Hancock, lead author of the study and professor of physiotherapy at Macquarie University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Unlike many conventional treatments, CFT doesn't focus on short-term symptom relief. Instead, it teaches patients to reframe how they think about pain, and to shift away from protective or fear-driven behaviors and build self-management skills that ideally last long after the sessions end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Pain patients often have kinesiophobia, where the thought of being in pain and the fear of what it might do to them results in them moving less. But a part of what makes back pain worse is that thought process, so I often tell my patients, 'if you don't use it, you'll lose it,'" said Dr. Rohan Jotwani, an interventional pain specialist and anesthesiologist at Och Spine at New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Woman in home office suffering from back pain sitting at computer desk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Boonchai Wedmakawand/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;CFT doesn't involve pills or surgery but can be used alongside other treatments, the study says. While it can be used on its own, it also complements other approaches by helping patients build the skills and confidence to stay active and engaged in daily life, Hancock explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“There’s something happening at a deeper level related to how patients appreciate and process their pain that’s changing, and those skills over time are helping patients feel better even when the therapy ends,” said Jotwani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The treatment worked across a broad range of patients, according to the study, including with participants that had been living with disabling back pain for years and many had tried multiple treatments without success. Even in this group, a relatively short course of CFT led to meaningful, lasting improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The researchers said the key is not just what’s done during the sessions but the shift in the participant's mindset that it creates, giving people tools to manage flare-ups, move with less fear and regain more control over their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The researchers noted some limitations to their study, including that some of the participants dropped out before it was complete. Additionally, all of the subjects were Australian, so it’s unclear whether Americans would respond as positively to CFT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Jotwani said he finds the results promising, especially for patients who haven't found relief through conventional treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“There’s not many things that we can say that gives patients three years of relief after an intervention … so these results are quite encouraging,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Michelle Lee, MD, is a doctor in New York City and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 22:35:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQVmdsckt1YzVCZlVSMVg3MXU5aUU1RU5IOTdTMFZmUi00clhhN09WVVJibWQ5cGxZUUpsX2ZFR2VJdFB5OHo4RlFDbHZQZU5jcVBFaW1NSTZJU0dLcFdtNGx3WHhIeThpLWxwemZ2bC05Q2lsSVNENjRlaGtwVXE1R2YtNFVSSllmY3VCUlpQV2NZWEJ1U1I0Qnk5WGZLRHV3aXZzVEpjTGNsZ9IBrwFBVV95cUxOM29LRjM4Vk5INDVmdDNtSnljR25kQmFINnZVXzN1U1Z5SXlLWlczNmtsd2JDRWJkUDNjTTRDRXotQ3o4ZF9DRGZWX19BTWVlRS1mYVVCcGV6TDh3OXNEWDJUVEZ2eEE1V25rRjRHWFU0RUdQSER2ak1pTzZVVHpmaVZVRnlTb2pUaFlScVZweWRKNC11QUdZQ2JkSHNQOEwzQUpySDVuOHNvUk16NUtR</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，童年的言语和身体虐待留下了类似的影响- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxPa1lmSUtNeXhpT0x3c0E2M0lzZkVHNlk3dEtoN0Ywb2VqV3pQZGhKZVVfcXV1aFlUSlNFeWtJVi01Z3VLUVpjNXpNcUJ2T003WC0zdVduTXRZVngwbGRqUFFFVXJxd0lWV25JbC0yNkwyMmhiczlrZE1zVWVlelVnWk9TWno0QdIBiwFBVV95cUxNWjJORDM2RTJWX3NJNWY5WU9iSklyVVVXMmhCd1F1SXMyVWUwYkI3T0VySWhib0p5emFjQ3BhQjN5YU41MWtzSlFfRFBiVklQT3lMS3A3WVlkS01fejFwQUFpcTR1UndzZjZQUWM3TVJoX2R6N2FaRkU2OGRQVUV4SUJ5Rm9PdUdHQlRF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Cruel words can leave a mark on a child –– and may have as much of an impact as physical abuse, new research has found﻿.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot00083b6nyablv7mn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People who experienced physical abuse as a child were at a 50% increased risk of reporting low mental health in adulthood compared with those with no abuse, according to the study published Tuesday in the &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjopen-2024-098412" target="_blank"&gt;journal BMJ Open&lt;/a&gt;. Those who experienced verbal abuse had a 60% increase in likelihood of low well-being.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot00093b6n7385a5h1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The prevalence of physical abuse&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in people in England and Wales has halved, from 20% in people born from 1950 to 1979 to 10% in those born in or after 2000, according to the study. Verbal abuse, on the other hand, has increased.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000a3b6nlcp4cerc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, more than 60% of people participating in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmmwr%2Fvolumes%2F73%2Fsu%2Fsu7304a5.htm%23T2_down&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmadeline.holcombe%40cnn.com%7C3775516c14b4437f0bb408ddd3f67c96%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638899777813083208%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=Z75RByubC3lPh4APMZGmIh21dMrKqtzEgC2Zq5sKTms%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;Youth Risk Behavior Survey&lt;/a&gt; reported experiencing emotional abuse and 31.8% reported physical abuse. The survey listed emotional instead of verbal abuse, but asked about similar behaviors as the most recent study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000b3b6nr4zjpf2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In this latest analysis, researchers analyzed data from more than 20,000 adults across seven different studies in England and Wales. The study team evaluated childhood experiences using the Adverse Childhood Experiences tool and components of adult mental health using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000c3b6n4zzakwzy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The “results suggest that verbal abuse in childhood can leave mental health scars as deep and long-lasting as those caused by physical abuse,” said lead study author Dr. Mark Bellis, professor of public health and behavioral sciences at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000d3b6nh3ctsg9i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Across the United States and the world, there has been an epidemiological shift of a greater burden of verbal abuse across generations, said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Shanta Dube, professor of epidemiology and director of the department of public health at the Levine College of Health Sciences at Wingate University in Wingate, North Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000e3b6nod98uj3v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She added that emotional abuse is “often tied to the act of verbal abuse and therefore verbal abuse can often get lost.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000f3b6nig2a0j93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rise of verbal abuse amid the decline of physical abuse highlights a need to raise awareness around spoken abuse, especially given the lasting impact, said Dube, who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000g3b6nll4nc03a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Verbal abuse may be eroding the mental health benefits we should expect from successful efforts to reduce physical abuse,” Bellis added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000h3b6nmngy67ct@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It can be hard to draw the line for sure on what language is harsh and what is verbal abuse, but it can include blaming, insulting, scolding, criticizing or threatening children, said Dr. Andrea Danese, professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at King’s College London and adjunct clinical professor at the Yale Child Study Center. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000i3b6njh4cg0pa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Think about the use of derogatory terms or statements intended to frighten, humiliate, denigrate or belittle a person,” he said. “It is often unintentional.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000j3b6nh349k3ft@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Comments can sound like “Johnny can do it. Why can’t you?” “You always make mistakes,” “You’re stupid,” or “You’re worthless,” Dube said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000k3b6nwqs1bsfj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Harsh, denigrating words spoken to children have lasting impacts. Children developmentally are concrete thinkers ‘it is or isn’t,” she said in an email. “They can take things literally.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000l3b6n8vm5bwea@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children rely on the language of the adults in their immediate environment to learn both about themselves and the world, Danese said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000m3b6nh0eeftp8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Therefore, the way children are talked to can be very powerful in both positive and negative ways, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000n3b6n1jn2yzt1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Being the subject of verbal abuse can twist a young person’s understanding of who they are and their role in the world,” Danese said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000o3b6npb26ah6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study relies on observational data, meaning that researchers cannot say for sure that verbal abuse in childhood causes poorer mental health in adulthood, only that there is a connection between the two.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000p3b6norwmu3w3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It could be that people who experience verbal abuse in their younger years have trauma later, but it also could be that adults with worse mental health are more likely to remember their childhood more harshly, Danese said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000q3b6nvq8qrlub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the sample size was large enough and the approach was strong enough to add to the existing evidence around impacts of verbal abuse, Dube said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmdz02j8r00123b6n993k1x75@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="language-has-power-good-and-bad" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Language has power –– good and bad
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000r3b6nzkhs9nf8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is increasingly important that researchers and individuals pay attention to the factors that impact long-term mental health, Bellis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Poor mental health is a major and growing global public health issue, particularly among adolescents and young adults,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000t3b6n27u4utb9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Part of the decline in physical abuse may be attributed to more awareness, data collection and campaigns focused on its reduction over the years, Dube added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000u3b6nwbb9uuvt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Improving childhood environments can directly enhance mental well-being as well as helping build resilience to protect against the future mental health challenges individuals may face through adolescence and adulthood,” Bellis said in an email. “We need to ensure that the harms of verbal abuse are more widely recognised.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000v3b6njezwj8dx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Parents and caregivers with more information and support may be better equipped to create better home environments for their children, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000w3b6nfnv599ib@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This means helping build emotional regulation skills in parents and children, helping catalyse emotional attachment between them, developing their communication skills and encouraging modelling behaviours in parents so that they demonstrate the type of approaches to problems that they would like to see in their children,” Bellis said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000x3b6n1mpjxpxq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the issue doesn’t stop with parents –– all adults who interact with children need to understand the impacts of verbal abuse, Dube said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000y3b6nvbbyw7xr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And the answer isn’t just to shame adults, Danese said. Instead, he and other researchers are looking to support a cultural shift toward everyone being more mindful about the language used toward children and how it might affect them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000z3b6nyvc5emti@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not about dramatising times when we could have let negative comments on children slip,” he said in an email. “It is about being mindful of them and trying to repair them with an apology, a correction, and an explanation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

told her family she would never recover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without any hope, her family agreed to donate her organs and preparations were made with procurement organization New Mexico Donor Services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In her final days, Gallegos' family said they saw tears in her eyes - a sign that they say donation coordinators quickly brushed off, claiming watery eyes were just a reflex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the day her organs were set to be taken, one of Gallegos' sisters said she was adamant Danella was still sentient because she saw her move while holding her hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors in a pre-surgery room were left stunned when Gallegos, deep in a coma but still medically alive, was able to blink her eyes on the medic's command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the organ coordinator in the room told doctors that they should ply the patient with morphine and move ahead anyway, according to a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/20/us/organ-transplants-donors-alive.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The organ donation industry is facing mounting scrutiny amid allegations that it is rife with mistakes and abuse as hospitals try to keep up with demand for organs (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gallegos's doctors defied the coordinators, and they brought her out of surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors' decision saved her life - as Gallegos went on to make a full recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I feel so fortunate,' she says, adding that she recalled feeling fear while in her coma but not much else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But it’s also crazy to think how close things came to ending differently.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hospital workers told the Times that they faced pressure from New Mexico Donor Services to forge ahead despite their doubts, which the organization denied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The organ harvesting organization said that it does not interfere with medical decision making, and stressed that only hospitals are in charge of caring for patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In response, Presbyterian Hospital said that Donor Services was actually responsible for all aspects of the donation process. It has launched an investigation into Gallegos's case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'All they care about is getting organs,' Neva Williams, a veteran intensive care nurse at the hospital, told the&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/20/us/organ-transplants-donors-alive.html"&gt; Times&lt;/a&gt;. 'They’re so aggressive. It’s sickening.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New Mexico Donor Services has been contacted by Daily Mail for comment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The harrowing story emerged as mounting scrutiny has fallen on the organ donation industry amid allegations that it is rife with mistakes and abuse.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Anthony Hoover was set to be removed from life support and his organs taken in 2021 when he suddenly woke up moments before. He suffered severe neurological injuries, but survived the ordeal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many such stories have emerged as hospitals increasingly turn to a type of organ removal called 'donation after circulatory death', where a patient is not deemed medically deceased but is not likely to ever recover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These surgeries, which require permission from the patient's family, accounted for a third of all organ donations last year in the US, and triple the number from five years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The space of time between when a person is dead and when their organs are viable is short, meaning that the process can be subject to rushed decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Kentucky, a federal investigation this year found that the state's organ procurement organization had ignored signs of increasing consciousness among 73 donors, including a man whose organs were pursued even as he shook his head and pulled his knees up to his chest.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think these types of problems are happening much more than we know,' Dr. Wade Smith, a longtime neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco, told the Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The organ harvesting industry was met with increased federal oversight last year following a shock hearing that included testimony from another near-miss patient, Anthony Hoover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Misty Hawkins, 42, spent weeks in a coma last year before her family decided to donate her organs, and doctors had already sawed into her breastplate when they discovered she was still alive &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hoover was set to be removed from life support and his organs taken in 2021 when he suddenly woke up moments before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He suffered severe neurological injuries, but survived the ordeal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His case led Kentucky authorities to put in place new policies to perform regular neurological testing on patients to scan for brain activity, and develop ways for clinicians to pause donations when they can see a patient is improving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Hoover was saved moments before he was removed from life support, the Times investigation found that another patient, Misty Hawkins, was only found to still be alive after doctors had already sawed into her chest.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hawkins, 42, fell into a coma last year after choking while eating, and spent weeks in hospital before her mother was faced with the decision of taking her off life support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her mother eventually decided to go ahead and donate her organs, and 103 minutes after Hawkins was taken off life support she was declared dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A surgeon sawed through her breastbone, only to discover that her heart was still beating and she appeared to be breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hawkins sadly passed a short time after her organ donation surgery was abruptly stopped &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hospital staff said that surgeons 'immediately stopped the procedure once they saw that the donor’s heart was beating', but Hawkins sadly passed away a short time later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts said that while organ donation saves thousands of lives every year, the industry is rapidly expanding, meaning procurement organizations continually try and arrange more transplants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Health and Human Services Department has said in 2020 that the growing demand led it to begin grading procurement organizations based on how many organ donations they get each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some now say that this leads procurers to pressure doctors to operate on patients on the line between living and dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Robert Cannon, a transplant surgeon at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told the Times that he believes the industry has morphed into a vulnerable system where doctors are hesitant to speak out through fear that people could stop donating altogether. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don’t know the scope of the problem. I don’t know that anybody does,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's the scary thing.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Fifty-eight people in New York City have been diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease, a serious bacterial lung infection, and two people have died, according to the city health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyxelu100043b6o1gneou0g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The bacteria, Legionella, is &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/cd/legionnaires-disease-faq-central-harlem.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;suspected to be spread&lt;/a&gt; by cooling towers on buildings in Central Harlem. A cooling tower is a rooftop device that releases mist into the air as it cools a large building. If the water inside becomes too warm, stagnant, or isn’t properly disinfected, Legionella can grow and sicken people who inhale the mist. The disease cannot be spread from person to person.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyxelu100053b6orv2df64x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The city health department first announced the cluster on July 25. The city said it would test all the cooling towers in the area, and as of Monday, remediation was completed on 11 that had an initial positive screening for the Legionella pneumophila bacteria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyxelu100063b6o3k9z1aqe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Anyone in these zip codes with flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible,” Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said in a &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2025/nyc-health-provides-second-legionnaires-cluster-update.page" target="_blank"&gt;news release on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyxelu100073b6om2k8muq7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Legionnaires’ disease causes flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, muscles aches and shortness of breath. It’s treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can cause shock and multi-organ failure, according to the World Health Organization. About 10% of people who get Legionnaires’ &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;die from complications&lt;/a&gt; of their illness, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and it’s more dangerous for older adults and people with weakened immune systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyxelu100083b6ovzn2bgy6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Around 6,000 Legionnaires’ disease cases are reported each year in the United States, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but reported totals may be lower than the actual cases in part because it can be difficult to distinguish Legionnaires’ disease from other types of pneumonia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Fifty-eight people in New York City have been diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease, a serious bacterial lung infection, and two people have died, according to the city health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyxelu100043b6o1gneou0g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The bacteria, Legionella, is &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/cd/legionnaires-disease-faq-central-harlem.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;suspected to be spread&lt;/a&gt; by cooling towers on buildings in Central Harlem. A cooling tower is a rooftop device that releases mist into the air as it cools a large building. If the water inside becomes too warm, stagnant, or isn’t properly disinfected, Legionella can grow and sicken people who inhale the mist. The disease cannot be spread from person to person.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyxelu100053b6orv2df64x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The city health department first announced the cluster on July 25. The city said it would test all the cooling towers in the area, and as of Monday, remediation was completed on 11 that had an initial positive screening for the Legionella pneumophila bacteria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Anyone in these zip codes with flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible,” Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said in a &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2025/nyc-health-provides-second-legionnaires-cluster-update.page" target="_blank"&gt;news release on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyxelu100073b6om2k8muq7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Legionnaires’ disease causes flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, muscles aches and shortness of breath. It’s treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can cause shock and multi-organ failure, according to the World Health Organization. About 10% of people who get Legionnaires’ &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;die from complications&lt;/a&gt; of their illness, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and it’s more dangerous for older adults and people with weakened immune systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyxelu100083b6ovzn2bgy6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Around 6,000 Legionnaires’ disease cases are reported each year in the United States, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but reported totals may be lower than the actual cases in part because it can be difficult to distinguish Legionnaires’ disease from other types of pneumonia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

While most symptoms usually resolve within two weeks, the “debilitating” joint pain can persist for months or years, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya#:~:text=The%20joint%20pain%20is%20often,%2C%20nausea%2C%20fatigue%20and%20rash." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya#:~:text=The%20joint%20pain%20is%20often,%2C%20nausea%2C%20fatigue%20and%20rash." data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya#:~:text=The%20joint%20pain%20is%20often,%2C%20nausea%2C%20fatigue%20and%20rash." aria-label="World Health Organization."&gt;World Health Organization.&lt;/a&gt; The joint pain is the calling card of chikungunya and, without it, people with the virus can easily be misdiagnosed as having dengue or Zika, making it hard to know exactly how many people are infected. Chikungunya was first detected in southern Tanzania in the 1950s. The name comes from a word in the Kimakonde language of southern Tanzania that means “that which bends up," meant to describe the contorted posture of people with severe joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;How Does Chikungunya Virus Spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya can only be transmitted to a person through the bite of an infected mosquito, but people can transmit it right back to the insect. So if a non-infected mosquito bites a person with the chikungunya, it can contract the virus and infect the next healthy person it bites. It is not contagious or transmittable person to person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Is There A Chikungunya Vaccine? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. There are two approved for use in the United States: IXCHIQ, a live-attenuated vaccine, is approved for people 18 and older and VIMKUNYA, a virus-like particle vaccine, is approved for those 12 and older. The CDC only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/vaccines/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/vaccines/index.html" aria-label="recommends"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; the vaccine to people traveling to an area with a chikungunya outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Is There Chikungunya Virus In The United States?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, but it's not common. In the U.S., chikungunya is primarily found in travelers who've been infected in other countries and a locally acquired case hasn't been reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/chikungunya-us.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/chikungunya-us.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/chikungunya-us.html" aria-label="since 2019"&gt;since 2019&lt;/a&gt;. But travel-associated cases are on the rise. Chikungunya was rarely found in the U.S. before 2006, but as many as 28 people per year tested positive from 2006 to 2013. Nearly 3,000 travel-associated cases were identified in 2014 but that number steadily decreased down to 36 in 2021 before slowly climbing again. There were 199 cases found in 2024 and, in 2025, there have been 46 cases so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Where Chikungunya Virus Most Commonly Found?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/index.html" aria-label="warn"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt; that U.S. travelers visiting Brazil, Columbia, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Thailand and the Philippines are at an elevated risk of exposure. The CDC also issued a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/chikungunya-china" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/chikungunya-china" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/chikungunya-china" aria-label="Level 2"&gt;Level 2&lt;/a&gt; travel alert for Foshan city, and recommends any traveler to the area be vaccinated. People who do visit are encouraged to prevent mosquito bites by wearing insect repellent, long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Pregnant women are advised not to travel to the region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What To Watch For&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More infections.

						&lt;p&gt;A North Carolina man is still &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/flesh-eating-bacteria-outer-banks-man-icu-nc-cases-august-2025/"&gt;fighting a serious bacterial
infection&lt;/a&gt; that landed him in an Outer Banks ICU for more than a week. His case is one
of a handful reported this year, drawing attention to a potentially deadly bacteria
found in coastal waters.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; is a flesh-eating bacterium that
can cause serious illness and lead to sepsis, shock, and large blisters that
destroy tissue. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The bacteria live in brackish water – a mixture of fresh and
salt water. North Carolina is home to several areas where &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt;
could flourish near the coast, especially during warmer months. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;An infection usually occurs in two ways: if someone has an
open wound and enters brackish water, or if someone eats contaminated raw
shellfish, usually oysters.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Infections are rare but can be fatal. About 1 in 5 people with
&lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; will die, sometimes in as little as 1-2 days, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html#cdc_disease_basics_population-people-at-risk"&gt;according
to the CDC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;North Carolina has already reported one confirmed death from
&lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; this year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;NCDHHS data shows 59 total cases of Vibrio were reported
between January 1-July 31, 2025. Of them, 7 are confirmed &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt;
infections. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/flesh-eating-bacteria-cases-nc-coast-august-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/flesh-eating-bacteria-cases-nc-coast-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Those at the highest risk of infection are those who:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Have cuts, scrapes or surgical wounds and go
into brackish water&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Have weakened immune systems &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Eat raw oysters or undercooked seafood&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;While longer, warmer seasons are allowing more bacteria to
grow, the average beachgoer’s risk remains low. For reference, roughly &lt;a href="https://www.outerbankschamber.com/main/north-carolina-s-outer-banks/"&gt;5
million people visit the Outer Banks&lt;/a&gt; every year, according to the Outer
Banks Chamber of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/flesh-eating-bacteria-cases-nc-coast-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;NCDHHS State Veterinarian Carl Williams said he wants people
to know it’s still safe to go enjoy the beach, but it’s important to manage
risk of Vibrio infections. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Don’t be afraid to go,” Williams said. “Just know, like
anything, that every activity is probably going to have a certain amount of
risk associated with it. If you have a wound, cover it before you go into salt
water. If you sustain a wound while you’re in the water, come out and wash it.”
&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state health expert explained &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; that
causes necrotizing fasciitis, as well as &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Parahaemolyticus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Alginolyticus&lt;/i&gt; that cause the food-borne illnesses, are all normal
inhabitants of a marine environment, like those found on North Carolina’s coast.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He added, “Our message to people is yes, they’re in the ocean
and the sounds, but they’re supposed to be there. You can take precautions to
make sure you don’t get infected.” &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;People heading to the beach can take &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/prevention/index.html"&gt;these simple measures&lt;/a&gt;
to significantly reduce risk of vibrio infections:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Avoid eating raw or undercooked seafood&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Shower with soap after leaving the beach &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Cleaning cuts and wounds with hydrogen peroxide &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Cover wounds with waterproof bandages when
entering brackish water&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of a &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; infection can occur
within 1 to 2 days. Health officials said early warning signs need to be taken
seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/flesh-eating-bacteria-cases-nc-coast-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;If you experience any of these symptoms, seek medical
attention immediately:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Redness or swelling near a wound&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Skin blisters or pain&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Fever&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·

In April, her doctor prescribed her the weight loss drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News &amp;amp; Media &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ali Eastburn, here a size 16, said she struggled with weight gain after menopause,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/health/is-wegovy-safe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ozempic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and others in its class (the active agent, semaglutide, is marketed under the brand names &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/doctor-explains-why-tiktokers-should-avoid-viral-weight-loss-trend-with-diabetes-drug-ozempic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Wegovy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Wegovy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/tirzepatide-new-drug-weight-loss-expected-approval-fda-this-year/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mounjaro;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt;) impact satiety.

Semaglutide has demonstrated improvements in CV death, stroke and myocardial infarction. Novo Nordisk remains confident in the benefit-risk profile of our GLP-1 medicines, when used consistent with their indications and product labeling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eastburn said, "At first, it seemed like a miracle. The weight was just coming off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By the start of July, Eastburn had lost 15 lbs. “I felt better and that there was hope,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But then, her weight loss stalled: “I knew I had to do something drastic as I was desperate to look better. I didn't want to hate the wedding photos for the rest of my life,” Eastburn said. “I upped my dose so I could get to my goal of losing 20 lbs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eastburn did not clarify whether she consulted with a doctor before increasing her dosage of Ozempic.

She said she ended up in the emergency room twice, struggling with nausea and “violent diarrhea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, she flew from Nashville to Orange County, Calif., on July 15 for the wedding — only to get so ill on the flight that once they landed, “an ambulance took me to the hospital straight away and I was diagnosed with a burst appendix.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A burst appendix is a medical emergency, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8095-appendicitis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, and happens when the appendix becomes inflamed; When it bursts, it sends bacteria throughout your body, risking life-threatening complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eastburn spent four days in the hospital, missing Chase’s rehearsal dinner. ”I just cried as I felt like it was my fault as I did this to myself. I missed all of this as I wanted to be thin and it broke my heart,” said Eastburn, who nearly missed the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We went at the very last minute as I was in so much pain. Sitting on a chair was so painful and I could barely walk. When my son saw me sitting in the front row, he came over and hugged me for the longest time and bawled like a baby,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We didn't think I was going to be at the wedding, much less live to tell anyone about it. I didn't care about my size as I was just so proud to be there.

    &lt;p&gt;A newborn baby from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts is fighting for her life at a Boston hospital after preliminary tests show she contracted &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/powassan-virus-sharon-massachusetts-ticks/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Powassan virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, a rare but serious tick-borne disease that &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/ticks-massachusetts-powassan-virus/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;can be fatal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, local health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lily Sisco was flown to Massachusetts General Hospital just weeks after she was born, her mother Tiffany Sisco said. She said Lily had a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tick-bites-how-to-spot-get-rid-of/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "the size of a needle tip" on her after a short walk on the West Tisbury bike path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She is still fighting daily at MGH and continuing to leave the doctors speechless with her progress," Sisco &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/tiffany.lynn.9003/posts/pfbid02HjHUURrsoUGoWhDnqMDe9N3ccmig2n63QU1jzno6gVmwzr1vK2cgovodS4XsHLWjl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;wrote on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend. "Although the CDC,  Neurological Doctors and Nurses have no answers for long term, we remain hopeful and extremely blessed that she is still alive today and continuing to progress in the right direction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Powassan virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martha's Vineyard health officials &lt;a href="https://www.capecod.gov/2025/08/05/press-release-rare-but-serious-tick-borne-virus-investigated-on-marthas-vineyard/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Monday that they are investigating a case of Powassan. This would be only the second confirmed case of the virus on the island in the past two decades. They said three other cases have been confirmed elsewhere in Massachusetts by the Centers for Disease Control so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were just 57 cases nationwide in 2024, and 24 cases so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powassan is transmitted by deer ticks, and it's estimated that between 1% and 2% of deer ticks on Martha's Vineyard are infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no treatment for Powassan, which can cause brain inflammation or meningitis. Many people who are exposed to the virus may not even know they were infected, but older adults and children are considered to be at high risk. It is deadly in about 10% of cases, and survivors may suffer from long-term health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tufts Medical Center Chief Infection Control Officer Dr. Shira Doron said what makes the virus so dangerous, compared to other tick-borne illnesses, is that it can infect a person within 15 minutes of a bite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Very, very quickly, sort of right away," Dr. Doron said. "And then we don't have that what we call post exposure, prophylaxis, or the ability to give a drug that will prevent that infection from happening." &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sisco said Lily was flown to the hospital after a persistent fever, and her symptoms progressed to seizures. The inflammation is causing scarring in her brain, Sisco said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We certainly had no idea a 20 minute walk on the West Tisbury bike path beside our home, a walk we do most every day, could potentially cause my child her life," Sisco said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preventing tick bites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/new-england-worst-tick-season-5-years/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;bad tick season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the area. The CDC said earlier this summer that emergency room visits for tick bites in the Northeast are at their highest levels in at least five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ticks are most active during the warm weather months, but can be outside any time the temperature is above freezing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not common for babies who don't walk to get tick-borne illnesses in general," Dr. Doron said. "This was really an unfortunate situation. Obviously."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent tick bites, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health recommends using insect repellent, wearing long, light-colored clothing, and staying on trails when walking. Experts also say to check yourself, children and pets for ticks after being outside in an area where ticks might be present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Please, please, please check yourselves, your children and your pets," Sisco said.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers found what they dubbed a “sex-related gap” in the use of DMTs between women and men with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing-remitting MS&lt;/a&gt; (RRMS) with disease onset between the ages of 18 and 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this, the team called for both clinicians and patients to be “educated on the most recent recommendations on the use of DMTs,” specifically “in the context of pregnancy,” to prevent this inequity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandra Vukusic, MD, PhD, a study author from the University of Lyon, noted that “when used early, MS drugs can delay the burden of the disease.” Thus, “women who are not treated could have worse outcomes in the long term and an increased risk of long-term disability,” Vukusic said in an &lt;a href="https://aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/5274"&gt;American Academy of Neurology press release&lt;/a&gt; outlining the study’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This loss of chance is not acceptable anymore, as there are drugs that are compatible with pregnancy or can continue to fight the disease long after people stop them when they are trying to conceive,”  Vukusic said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213907"&gt;Sex-Related Gap in the Use of Disease-Modifying Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS occurs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; when the immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath that serves as a protective coating around nerve fibers, ensuring the efficient transmission of electric signals in the body. The disease is most commonly diagnosed in young adults and women. In fact, being a woman is one of the strongest risk factors for developing the disease, data have shown.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-treatment/"&gt;Treatment approaches for MS&lt;/a&gt; have markedly evolved in recent years, most notably with the introduction of various DMTs. Evidence shows that access to high-efficacy DMTs early on in the disease is more effective at preventing long-term disability progression than not using such treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Women 20% less likely than men to receive highly effective DMTs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a research team from institutions across France sought to assess if and how a person’s sex affects access to DMTs. To that end, the team retrospectively analyzed health records from people with RRMS that had started between patients were ages 18 to 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis included data from 16,857 women and 5,800 men, with a mean age of 29, who were followed for a median of 11.6 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the findings indicated that women with RRMS were less likely to receive a DMT than men with the disease. Data specifically showed that the percentage of person-years that study patients received a DMT was lower for women than it was for men (60.2% vs. 61.3%). The same was true for highly effective DMTs (23.5% vs. 25.3%). Person-years is a unit that measures the amount of time a group of people has been observed; it is calculated by taking the number of people being studied and multiplying it by the number of years they were followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because women tend to have more active disease, and also are often advised to halt treatment during pregnancy or postpartum, the researchers reanalyzed the data after making adjustments for these factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The differences were found to persist, with women having an 8% lower chance of receiving a DMT compared with men. In the case of highly effective DMTs, analysis showed that women were 20% less likely than men to receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found that women were less likely to be treated with a disease-modifying drug than men with the same level of disease severity, even when we took into account people who stopped taking their drugs during pregnancy or postpartum,” Vukusic said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sex-related differences became evident two years after disease onset for DMTs and one year for highly effective DMTs, and did not differ significantly according to patients’ age, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Study found certain treatments significantly underused by women&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain treatments were significantly underused in women, the researchers found. Among them were teriflunomide (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/aubagio-teriflunomide-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Aubagio&lt;/a&gt;), as well as sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulators — a class of DMTs that include fingolimod (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/gilenya-fingolimod-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Gilenya&lt;/a&gt;), siponimod (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/mayzent-siponimod"&gt;Mayzent&lt;/a&gt;), ponesimod (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ponvory-ponesimod-relapsing-rrms/"&gt;Ponvory&lt;/a&gt;), and ozanimod (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/zeposia-ozanimod/"&gt;Zeposia&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also significantly underused by women were CD20 inhibitors, such as ocrelizumab (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ocrevus-ocrelizumab-primary-progressive-relapsing-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Ocrevus&lt;/a&gt;), the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interferon-based medications and natalizumab (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/tysabri-natalizumab-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Tysabri&lt;/a&gt;) were initially less used by women, but then became equally used by both female and male patients after some time. Interestingly, glatiramer acetate (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/copaxone-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Copaxone&lt;/a&gt;) and fumarate therapies, such as dimethyl fumarate (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/tecfidera-dimethyl-fumarate-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Tecfidera&lt;/a&gt;), were initially equally used by patients of both sexes, but then became more frequently used by women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;Anticipation of pregnancy was probably an important factor in this difference between women and men with MS, but there could also be a reluctance to use these treatments when they may actually be the best way to manage the disease and delay disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses also showed that among the 5,268 women who had a child, the proportion of those given DMTs started to decline 18 months before childbirth, from 42.6% to 27.9% at the estimated time of conception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anticipation of pregnancy was probably an important factor in this difference between women and men with MS, but there could also be a reluctance to use these treatments when they may actually be the best way to manage the disease and delay disability,” Vukusic said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other factors also may have played a role, according to Vukusic, such a lag in both clinicians and patients learning about the established safety of new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Another factor could be that new data continues to be collected on the safety of newer MS drugs, so more work is needed to communicate those findings to people with MS and their doctors,” Vukusic said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, these findings show a gap, by sex, in the use of DMTs by patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, these results highlight the need to educate both neurologists and patients on the latest guidelines for DMT use, particularly among women in their childbearing years, “to avoid deleterious therapeutic inertia.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A cancer diagnosis increases privately insured patients' monthly out-of-pocket costs, which also rise as the disease progresses, new research shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out-of-pocket costs jumped by $592.53 per month for the six months after a diagnosis, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://watermark.silverchair.com/rose_2025_oi_250641_1752092469.71531.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAzAwggMsBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggMdMIIDGQIBADCCAxIGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM1aXPC57hN3Y8iEDKAgEQgIIC46mfGInZf6KooHrPaV3UF7iZFwVr4lDTGA_P9TD3ZIiuR5oBEAJHnL9-Nvz6t2_ABtCy7Y9IbhpIW3Fy5RQJDF_dHlaNkIMLbZR1HEUelNUl8SHcBuYEu-dBYni3tV_EOGQOo0NChe-xH0OE530LJKm2fyDXGoOikA1SowsABUV4GruB2bHbaZrQdTe1Ram004ZK2lSZiYHUKLpMhWNzF1Djn1OjqGbOuQuvQeRiwUpqQl9rcsww5aIgId87PaJq4eBVZNC833KsQ8YxpM5HOMRWZy9kgIgBXplN8uE7497X-RbqQCFU8YTrCxcfLeRejnCudpC5uSTOHsiAgkoCt2wJZ7RAavIqpGWM6kHC24G2B8QT1-SS1DGsjCehR0hyCpGJt6cw1a9i0W6MN6YV_-V5VRfxJvADYYWw_JnvLAS6F6o9BWPkEUbQBjZz6b0vBpxIOh2JU04VmuZwPwikvn3_BVVDV5fGV9ZIqzL6TxcNgBmS0GdEVPuOVDsBEhLJxSutplc580W1udNIt9d5x4yxsoBIO29Xx4W8s-IwcJ2Qa6ngmQ3_c8IRBJtNfWN5XFeIBFbmDbg5VZpokqoWIpS742xqXu5Ve8FMC_F3OAvSdWk7ICua7wtxuTv_xmDPKMp3rG536gduBQj-D5813OH6z2LddAP0uBnEEfYlvsBZi2yKNX5Vj800xclAY0OVsde9V2dmjsVjOPGY49UHHsUwBklygi7eez_fPTj3W2H5COWHFtLyxNFqNTxiIRdJ9urvnMcwaNZmXdmEFJws-zuxfYPW7H_ceZByLvHRCs8qJ_7FL3KGFlxuGEpaeZx6tGogTujFj7eAHrVQrWbHWG6JT3gZIsuzSx-N37QL-5Sv87IWrc-t__N3anSkUfmgHzqe7cvb1K_Mp7DUISanr9uy-kjUx6f5bTsRLHgj6vy41dHZhkRbdQ_jJ735Rn-a2BXhyEFoZX9N-4nyF0EXV-_dBww" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published in JAMA Open Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study underscores the financial toll a cancer diagnosis can take on individuals, even for those who are insured but don't yet qualify for Medicare. While cancer tends to strike later in life, when most patients in treatment are receiving Medicare benefits, a cancer diagnosis can pose an undue financial burden on younger people with private insurance, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those out-of-pocket costs highlight the need for policy reform, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research "underscores the need for policies such as paid sick leave that address both insurance continuity and financial assistance, especially for patients with more advanced cancer," the report states. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out-of-pocket costs increased based on a patient's cancer progression, the analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with stage 0 cancer saw their costs rise by $462 per month compared to non-cancer patients, while stage 4 cancer cost people with private insurance an additional $719.97 per month in out of pocket costs. Costs rise as the disease progresses because patients typically require more treatment during cancer's later stages, leading to greater medical expenditures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This result seems straightforward; later-stage disease is associated with more intensive workup and treatment that can drive higher medical expenditures," the report states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed medical claims records from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry to compare the out-of-pocket costs of privately insured individuals under the age of 65 who were diagnosed with breast, colorectal, and lung cancer, to those without cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A cancer diagnosis increases privately insured patients' monthly out-of-pocket costs, which also rise as the disease progresses, new research shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out-of-pocket costs jumped by $592.53 per month for the six months after a diagnosis, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://watermark.silverchair.com/rose_2025_oi_250641_1752092469.71531.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAzAwggMsBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggMdMIIDGQIBADCCAxIGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM1aXPC57hN3Y8iEDKAgEQgIIC46mfGInZf6KooHrPaV3UF7iZFwVr4lDTGA_P9TD3ZIiuR5oBEAJHnL9-Nvz6t2_ABtCy7Y9IbhpIW3Fy5RQJDF_dHlaNkIMLbZR1HEUelNUl8SHcBuYEu-dBYni3tV_EOGQOo0NChe-xH0OE530LJKm2fyDXGoOikA1SowsABUV4GruB2bHbaZrQdTe1Ram004ZK2lSZiYHUKLpMhWNzF1Djn1OjqGbOuQuvQeRiwUpqQl9rcsww5aIgId87PaJq4eBVZNC833KsQ8YxpM5HOMRWZy9kgIgBXplN8uE7497X-RbqQCFU8YTrCxcfLeRejnCudpC5uSTOHsiAgkoCt2wJZ7RAavIqpGWM6kHC24G2B8QT1-SS1DGsjCehR0hyCpGJt6cw1a9i0W6MN6YV_-V5VRfxJvADYYWw_JnvLAS6F6o9BWPkEUbQBjZz6b0vBpxIOh2JU04VmuZwPwikvn3_BVVDV5fGV9ZIqzL6TxcNgBmS0GdEVPuOVDsBEhLJxSutplc580W1udNIt9d5x4yxsoBIO29Xx4W8s-IwcJ2Qa6ngmQ3_c8IRBJtNfWN5XFeIBFbmDbg5VZpokqoWIpS742xqXu5Ve8FMC_F3OAvSdWk7ICua7wtxuTv_xmDPKMp3rG536gduBQj-D5813OH6z2LddAP0uBnEEfYlvsBZi2yKNX5Vj800xclAY0OVsde9V2dmjsVjOPGY49UHHsUwBklygi7eez_fPTj3W2H5COWHFtLyxNFqNTxiIRdJ9urvnMcwaNZmXdmEFJws-zuxfYPW7H_ceZByLvHRCs8qJ_7FL3KGFlxuGEpaeZx6tGogTujFj7eAHrVQrWbHWG6JT3gZIsuzSx-N37QL-5Sv87IWrc-t__N3anSkUfmgHzqe7cvb1K_Mp7DUISanr9uy-kjUx6f5bTsRLHgj6vy41dHZhkRbdQ_jJ735Rn-a2BXhyEFoZX9N-4nyF0EXV-_dBww" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published in JAMA Open Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study underscores the financial toll a cancer diagnosis can take on individuals, even for those who are insured but don't yet qualify for Medicare. While cancer tends to strike later in life, when most patients in treatment are receiving Medicare benefits, a cancer diagnosis can pose an undue financial burden on younger people with private insurance, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those out-of-pocket costs highlight the need for policy reform, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research "underscores the need for policies such as paid sick leave that address both insurance continuity and financial assistance, especially for patients with more advanced cancer," the report states. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out-of-pocket costs increased based on a patient's cancer progression, the analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with stage 0 cancer saw their costs rise by $462 per month compared to non-cancer patients, while stage 4 cancer cost people with private insurance an additional $719.97 per month in out of pocket costs. Costs rise as the disease progresses because patients typically require more treatment during cancer's later stages, leading to greater medical expenditures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This result seems straightforward; later-stage disease is associated with more intensive workup and treatment that can drive higher medical expenditures," the report states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed medical claims records from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry to compare the out-of-pocket costs of privately insured individuals under the age of 65 who were diagnosed with breast, colorectal, and lung cancer, to those without cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

                FALLS CHURCH, Va.   –  
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;
            Are you a TRICARE beneficiary taking a drug for weight loss—such as a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/FAQs/Pharmacy/PharmProg_Wegovy"&gt;GLP-1 medication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; like Zepbound or Wegovy? Do you have questions about what’s covered—and why?

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the difference between TRICARE plans and coverage is key to knowing what to expect when filling your &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/pharmacy"&gt;prescription&lt;/a&gt;. There are different rules about how TRICARE covers these drugs based on your plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People are taking GLP-1 drugs—like Wegovy and Zepbound—for weight loss now more than ever,” said Defense Health Agency Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Paul Cordts. “It’s important to understand how—and why—TRICARE covers these drugs, based on your condition and status.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important: &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dha.mil/" target="_blank"&gt;Defense Health Agency&lt;/a&gt; is implementing regulatory controls on weight loss medication coverage. These controls take effect &lt;strong&gt;Aug. 31, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select, these medications are still covered in certain circumstances. Otherwise, if you have an approved &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/pharmacy/priorauth"&gt;prior authorization&lt;/a&gt; for weight loss drugs, it’s no longer valid. You’ll need to see your provider to discuss your options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your weight loss drug isn’t covered, you should speak with your provider about other options. These may include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your provider can work with you to explore all options and determine the best approach for your health needs. Talk to your provider. You can also visit &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/HealthWellness"&gt;Health and Wellness&lt;/a&gt; for more details on resources that can help you reach your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re affected, you’ll get a notice in the mail in the coming weeks. Read below to learn more about which groups are affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRICARE coverage of weight loss medications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;
TRICARE only covers weight loss medications for certain beneficiary groups. Coverage depends on your condition and certain criteria.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;TRICARE covers weight loss medications, including Saxenda, Wegovy, Zepbound, Qsymia, Phentermine or Contrave, for weight loss if:
 &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re enrolled in &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/prime"&gt;TRICARE Prime&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/Plans/HealthPlans/TS"&gt;TRICARE Select&lt;/a&gt;, or get these benefits from a premium-based plan. Premium-based plans include:

  
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You meet TRICARE’s clinical criteria.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have a prescription from a TRICARE network provider.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your provider submits a &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/CoveredServices/Pharmacy/FillPrescriptions/PreAuthMedical"&gt;prior authorization&lt;/a&gt; form.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;TRICARE covers Trulicity, Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Victoza to treat &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tricare.mil/News/TRICARE-News/Article/3311965/have-diabetes-check-supplies-services-tricare-covers"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Coverage requires:
 &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prior authorization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Victoza require medical necessity forms for a formulary copayment and coverage at a military pharmacy.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those &lt;strong&gt;excluded&lt;/strong&gt; from weight loss medication coverage are those who have &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/tfl"&gt;TRICARE For Life&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/FAQs/General/DC_DirectCareStatus"&gt;direct care only&lt;/a&gt; access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;a href="https://www.express-scripts.com/frontend/open-enrollment/tricare/fst/#/" target="_blank"&gt;TRICARE Formulary Search Tool&lt;/a&gt; to check your drug’s coverage. Also, be sure to &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/CoveredServices/Pharmacy/FillPrescriptions/PreAuthMedical"&gt;download prior authorization forms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; GLP-1s for the treatment of diabetes continue to be covered for all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes when &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/pharmacy/priorauth"&gt;medically necessary&lt;/a&gt; and when &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/pharmacy/priorauth"&gt;prior authorization&lt;/a&gt; requirements are met. Existing cost-shares for these medications haven’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember:&lt;/strong&gt; Use the &lt;a href="https://www.express-scripts.com/frontend/open-enrollment/tricare/fst/#/" target="_blank"&gt;TRICARE Formulary Search Tool&lt;/a&gt; to check costs and coverage requirements. Also, talk to your provider to confirm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Your drug’s indication&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If you’ll need prior authorization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthy habits are key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Are you currently taking a drug for weight loss? Remember: Forming healthy habits is crucial to maintaining a healthy weight. These can include:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Eating a balanced diet&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Exercising&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Cutting back on alcohol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;
TRICARE covers weight loss medication drugs (including GLP-1s) when you meet certain criteria, based on diagnosis, medical necessity, and your TRICARE plan. Talk to your provider about other options or to confirm coverage for your prescription.

						A Massachusetts mother has identified her newborn daughter as the possible case of Powassan virus that is under investigation by health officials on Martha's Vineyard. Health officials did not disclose where on the island the patient lives, their age or when they were infected. The virus has not been confirmed. Tiffany Sisco said her daughter, Lilly, had seizures and is receiving intensive care, including antibiotics, at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.  The family is awaiting the final testing results.Tiffany Sisco and her husband, Marcus, said shortly after the baby was born, they took her for a walk along a bike path in West Tisbury, with Lilly in a stroller covered by a blanket. Upon returning home, Tiffany discovered a tiny, pencil-head-sized tick on Lilly's ankle."I picked it off and I called him in and said, 'What do we do?' Because he's more familiar with them being a landscaper. And he said, 'Just throw it away. And we'll monitor her and make sure she doesn't get a rash, a bull's eye, anything like that. Like a week later she started getting a fever of 102. I said, 'I'm taking her right in,'" Tiffany Sisco said.For the first few days, Lilly needed help breathing, and her parents were unable to hold her. Doctors were uncertain if she would survive. The family now hopes to leave the hospital within a week. Tests indicate some signs of brain damage, but doctors are unsure how it may impact Lilly's development.Aside from the pending investigation, there has only been one case of Powassan virus on the island in the past 20 years. Three cases elsewhere in the state have been confirmed this year, officials said.Powassan is a rare but potentially serious virus transmitted by the bite of infected Ixodes scapularis ticks — commonly known as deer ticks. Unlike other tick-borne pathogens, Powassan virus can be transmitted within 15 minutes of a tick bite. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 2004 to 2024, there were 397 Powassan cases nationally with 50 deaths, with almost half of those infections occurring in the last five years.Massachusetts ranks second behind Minnesota in total number of cases in that same time frame, with 71, according to the CDC.So far in 2025, there have been 24 cases in seven states, with three of those recorded in Massachusetts, according to the CDC.There is no specific treatment, vaccine or cure for Powassan virus disease. Severe cases can cause brain swelling, encephalitis, confusion, seizures and long-term neurological complications."The virus is present every year in a small percentage of deer ticks; fortunately, severe disease remains very rare," said Dr. Sam Telford, a Tufts University professor with longstanding research on Martha’s Vineyard. Telford’s lab has tested more than 3,500 nymph deer ticks between 2021 and 2024. "Between 1 and 2% of nymph deer ticks on Martha’s Vineyard are infected. This is a similar rate to that seen elsewhere in New England. This suggests that many people who are exposed may successfully fight off the virus without ever knowing they were infected," Telford said.Top tips to prevent tick bites:    Treat your clothing and gear with permethrin.    Dress “tick-smart” — tuck pants into socks, shirts into pants, wear light-colored clothes to spot ticks more easily.        Leggings and snug-fitting clothing can prevent ticks from reaching the skin. Use a lint roller on your clothing after coming in from the outdoors to remove "hitchhikers."        Change clothes or shower soon after being outside.        Put clothes in the dryer on high for 20 minutes to kill ticks.        Do full-body tick checks with a mirrorVideo: Mass. doctor on infant possibly contracting Powassan virus

&lt;p&gt;For the first few days, Lilly needed help breathing, and her parents were unable to hold her. Doctors were uncertain if she would survive. The family now hopes to leave the hospital within a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="cream-inline-rec" class="cream-inline hidden"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tests indicate some signs of brain damage, but doctors are unsure how it may impact Lilly's development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the pending investigation, there has only been one case of Powassan virus on the island in the past 20 years. Three cases elsewhere in the state have been confirmed this year, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powassan is a rare but potentially serious virus transmitted by the bite of infected Ixodes scapularis ticks — commonly known as deer ticks. Unlike other tick-borne pathogens, Powassan virus can be transmitted within 15 minutes of a tick bite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/data-maps/historic-data.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, from 2004 to 2024, there were 397 Powassan cases nationally with 50 deaths, with almost half of those infections occurring in the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts ranks second behind Minnesota in total number of cases in that same time frame, with 71, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/data-maps/current-year-data.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;So far in 2025&lt;/a&gt;, there have been 24 cases in seven states, with three of those recorded in Massachusetts, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no specific treatment, vaccine or cure for Powassan virus disease. Severe cases can cause brain swelling, encephalitis, confusion, seizures and long-term neurological complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The virus is present every year in a small percentage of deer ticks; fortunately, severe disease remains very rare," said Dr. Sam Telford, a Tufts University professor with longstanding research on Martha’s Vineyard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telford’s lab has tested more than 3,500 nymph deer ticks between 2021 and 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Between 1 and 2% of nymph deer ticks on Martha’s Vineyard are infected. This is a similar rate to that seen elsewhere in New England. This suggests that many people who are exposed may successfully fight off the virus without ever knowing they were infected," Telford said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-h3"&gt;Top tips to prevent tick bites:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;    Treat your clothing and gear with permethrin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;    Dress “tick-smart” — tuck pants into socks, shirts into pants, wear light-colored clothes to spot ticks more easily.        Leggings and snug-fitting clothing can prevent ticks from reaching the skin. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use a lint roller on your clothing after coming in from the outdoors to remove "hitchhikers."        Change clothes or shower soon after being outside.        Put clothes in the dryer on high for 20 minutes to kill ticks.        Do full-body tick checks with a mirror&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video: Mass. doctor on infant possibly contracting Powassan virus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"People are buying and installing these systems in homes and schools hoping to protect themselves and their families but the science hasn't caught up to the marketing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only 8% included human participants &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of the 672 studies on a total of 1,073 interventions, 90% evaluated environmental samples only, only 8% included human participants, and 1% were based on sentinel animals. No studies reported pregnant women, fetus health, or postpartum populations. A total of 60% of studies analyzed at least one intervention classified as pathogen inactivation, with 30% involving pathogen removal or air exchange or dilution, and 21% on air exchange or dilution. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In total, 51 were observational studies, and six were randomized controlled trials. Studies were from all six World Health Organization regions, including the Americas (41%), Europe (25%), and the Western Pacific (25%). Three studies were from Africa.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most environmental studies were conducted in scaled or full-sized chambers. Other common settings were real-world or simulated healthcare facilities, schools, other workplaces, transportation conveyances, and residential buildings. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of all studies, 49% measured viable harmless microbes from air samples, followed by nonbiological particulate matter (eg, tracer gases, dust; 29%), and disease-causing viruses or bacteria (22%). Potential lung irritants (eg, ozone) that can be produced by ionizers, plasma-based technologies, and some UV systems were measured only rarely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;No studies measured quality of life or functioning, sustainability (eg, carbon footprint, greenhouse gas emissions), or economic analysis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Funding statements were unclear or unreported in 23% of studies. Of those with funding statements, 30% had multiple funding types. Most (66%) reported government funding. Conflict of interest (COI) statements were absent or unclear in 45%. In 291 studies, no authors included a COI statement. In the remaining 77 studies, 40% reported at least one COI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research on real-world health outcomes needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We were surprised to find that most of the research tested air cleaning devices in lab chambers, not in real-world settings where people live, work or go to school," Lisa Bero, PhD, of UC, said in the release. "We need stronger studies that look at actual health outcomes, whether people are actually exposed to fewer pathogens or get sick less often, and not just measurements of particles in the air."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coauthor Louis Leslie, of UC, said, "Ozone and other chemicals created by some air-cleaning devices can actually harm the respiratory system, especially in children or people with chronic respiratory illnesses."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be able to fully fund the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/php/od2a/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Overdose Data to Action or OD2A program&lt;/a&gt; ahead of a key budget deadline, according to a CDC senior leader. A second CDC staff member confirmed that "there have been developments and we are likely to have full funding," although they did not have details on when the funding would become available.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity because they fear retribution for speaking to the press without authorization. Some staffers at CDC expressed to NPR that this appeared to be good news, although the funding situation was still fluid and confusing.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;NPR reported last month that the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/16/nx-s1-5468535/fentanyl-trump-addiction-funding" target="_blank"&gt;was withholding $140 million&lt;/a&gt; from the OD2A program, which state and local public health departments rely on to lower overdose deaths from fentanyl, methamphetamines and other drugs across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Previously frozen funding for other CDC programs, including &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/08/nx-s1-5349529/hhs-layoffs-sexual-assault-rape-prevention" target="_blank"&gt;rape and domestic violence prevention&lt;/a&gt;, is also getting released, the senior CDC leader said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Funding, 30 days at a time&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The delays were part of a broader issue with funding at CDC. As NPR &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/28/nx-s1-5442689/cdc-trump-layoffs-public-health-rescission" target="_blank"&gt;reported in June&lt;/a&gt;, for months, CDC waited for the $9 billion Congress intended for the agency for fiscal year 2025. In the meantime, it received small amounts of money every 30 days to cover payroll and other limited expenses.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The senior leader described the process like receiving money "with an eyedropper."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without a pot of money to distribute out to various centers and divisions, the CDC couldn't send out the notice of awards that state and local health departments need to be able to do their work and know they will be reimbursed for it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Most state health departments get most of their funding from the feds — in Alabama's case, we get more than two thirds of our funding from federal grants, predominantly CDC," Dr. Scott Harris, who runs Alabama's health department, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/28/nx-s1-5442689/cdc-trump-layoffs-public-health-rescission" target="_blank"&gt;told NPR in June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Deadlines missed &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health departments across the country sounded the alarm as deadlines approached or passed for CDC funding of HIV prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/cdc-cuts-threaten-cancer-screening-state-level-tracking-for-emerging-threats/" target="_blank"&gt;cancer registries&lt;/a&gt; and overdose prevention programs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, most of those programs across CDC apparently can continue, including OD2A. Grantees for the OD2A program, who had been told in July they would be receiving only half of their funding, will soon be told they will receive the full amount, according to the senior leader at CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The news comes after advocates had been &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/16/nx-s1-5468535/fentanyl-trump-addiction-funding" target="_blank"&gt;warning for weeks&lt;/a&gt; of the harms that delayed or partial funding to the program could have. If full funding is actually coming, "it'll be welcome, but it's not without the toll that it's already taken," says &lt;a href="https://www.safestates.org/page/SharonGilmartin" target="_blank"&gt;Sharon Gilmartin&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Safe States Alliance, a public health advocacy group. For instance, NPR reported on a local health department in North Carolina that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/28/nx-s1-5442689/cdc-trump-layoffs-public-health-rescission" target="_blank"&gt;laid off staff&lt;/a&gt; because of CDC funding delays, only to have the funding come through weeks late without explanation. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I don't think anybody will feel confident until they have money in hand," Gilmartin adds. "And I'll be honest, I think the concern is that — if this is what we went through this year, even if funding comes through, are we going to be doing this again next year?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There was no available explanation from the Trump administration or the Office for Management and Budget for the delays or the release of the funding. OMB and the Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to NPR's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC senior leader describes the release of funding for the agency as a relief. "It's great we have our apportionment," they tell NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Some funds frozen&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But there's a new funding challenge. Several dozen specific CDC programs have now had their budget lines frozen at the direction of OMB, according to the senior leader at CDC. The news of the frozen funds was first reported &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-cdc-funding-freeze-79e7090f" target="_blank"&gt;by the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The frozen programs are mostly in the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, according to the senior leader at CDC. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A list of frozen programs reviewed by NPR includes those that address tobacco use, nutrition, physical activity and obesity, school health, inflammatory bowel disease, excessive alcohol use, chronic disease education and awareness, national diabetes prevention program, oral health, epilepsy, and more.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"What does it all mean?"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Funding for five programs at the CDC's Injury Center was frozen by OMB as well, including youth violence prevention, adverse childhood experiences, firearm injury, injury control research centers, and injury prevention activities. Gilmartin of the Safe States Alliance says it's hard to understand why these programs were targeted. "I can't come up with an ideological reason why you would want to cut funding that supports positive early childhood," for instance, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The senior leader at CDC says there are some big questions for OMB and the Trump administration: "How do we interpret all of this? What does it all mean?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There were whole teams fired during the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/05/g-s1-58312/hhs-layoffs-rif-cdc-fda-nih" target="_blank"&gt;dramatic reduction in force&lt;/a&gt; across HHS in April that appear to have full funding, the senior leader says, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sexual-violence/programs/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Rape Prevention and Education&lt;/a&gt; Program. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Similarly, there are programs with their budget lines frozen by OMB that are fully staffed, and still other priorities set forth in President Trump's 2026 budget, they say, which leaves the impression that there's no overarching strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Using eye-tracking and EEG during a visual task, researchers found that attention-related brain regions ramp up when we focus on potential rewards, but only when it boosts sensitivity—not bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, decision bias—our tendency to say “yes” or “no” based on reward—didn’t show activity in the brain’s attention centers at all. These findings uncover distinct reward-related pathways that shape how we see and decide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Split Processing:&lt;/strong&gt; Reward expectations influence sensitivity and bias via separate brain circuits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention vs. Decision:&lt;/strong&gt; Sensitivity engages visual attention areas; bias does not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Insights may help inform treatments for impulsivity, gambling, and addiction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;IISC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever noticed how animals instinctively choose the ripest fruits in a tree? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This behaviour, of seeking out the most rewarding option, offers a fascinating glimpse into the workings of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animals not only focus their attention on the most rewarding target (the location of the ripest fruit), but they also make a rapid decision to act on that information. Interestingly, the behavioural and neural mechanisms underlying this process are relatively underexplored.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112088"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain surrounded by fruits." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers strategically rigged the rewards – the number of reward points was fixed on one side, whereas the points varied on the other side; in other words, it could be higher or lower than the fixed side. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sridharan Devarajan, Associate Professor at the Centre for Neuroscience, Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and his PhD student Ankita Sengupta took up the task to investigate how the expectation of a reward influences attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/em&gt;offers fresh insights into this complex process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that the promise of a reward guides and dictates behaviour. People are quicker to detect changes, and respond faster and more accurately when they expect a reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many previous studies have investigated how the expectation of a reward influences attention and decision-making. But where they fell short is in differentiating whether these processes are governed by the same or different regions and processes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, Sridharan and Sengupta designed an experiment to examine how the expectation of a reward modulates the two key components of attention: sensitivity (the ability to visually identify the ripest fruit) and bias (the decision to act to pick out the ripest fruit). Researchers have often struggled to tease apart the impact of reward on sensitivity and bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sridharan’s team conducted trials with 24 participants, each performing a two-part cognitive task. The first part tested for reward effects on sensitivity. The participant looks at a screen displaying two Gabor patches (smooth black-and-white stripes used in attention research), one on each side of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a very brief pause (200 milliseconds), the patches flicker, and one (or both) of the patch orientations might change. Participants have to report if they detected a change in one of the two patches. For each trial that they reported the change accurately, they received a monetary reward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s where the task got interesting. The researchers strategically rigged the rewards – the number of reward points was fixed on one side, whereas the points varied on the other side; in other words, it could be higher or lower than the fixed side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants would realise this during the task, based on the points received, leading them to focus on and be more sensitive to minute changes on the side that would get them greater rewards.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second part tested for reward effects on bias. The only difference in this case was that the points for reporting a “Yes” option (deciding a change occurred), relative to a “No” option (deciding no change occurred) were varied on one side; as before, this reward could be higher or lower than the fixed side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, participants would be biased to choose the Yes option when it was more rewarding than the No option, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the tasks, the researchers measured the participants’ eye movements and brain activity, and quantified the two components of attention.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first task, where sensitivity was being examined, participants paid more attention, and their gaze was drawn towards the side associated with greater rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, their decisional bias didn’t change, indicating that only sensitivity was modulated in this task,” explains Sridharan. Moreover, well-known brain signatures of attention, including electrical responses and oscillations, signalled higher sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the second part of the task, where bias was examined, the researchers observed that participants were more likely (biased) to choose the option (yes/no) with the higher expected reward. But during this task, the researchers were surprised to notice that none of the participants’ gaze or brain patterns matched those associated with attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unexpectedly, changing bias did not result in any signatures specific to the attention centres in the brain,” says Sengupta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s results show, for the first time, that sensitivity and bias may be governed by separate neural mechanisms under the hood, each tuned differently by the anticipation of a reward. Moreover, while sensitivity seems to be closely linked to sensory attention centres, bias may be more closely linked to decision-making centres of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also has practical implications for understanding how we learn and make decisions in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies such as ours will help design tasks to understand risk-taking propensities in individuals, when faced with uncertain rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings may help to design treatments for addiction behaviours, such as gambling, which involve a complex interplay of reward, attention, and impulsive decisions,” adds Sridharan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this reward, attention, and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6516170c010d0417250c0c16064b04064b0c0b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sridharan Devarajan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://iisc.ac.in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IISC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sridharan Devarajan – IISC&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reward expectation yields distinct effects on sensory processing and decision making in the human brain&lt;/a&gt;” by Sridharan Devarajan et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reward expectation yields distinct effects on sensory processing and decision making in the human brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reward expectation robustly guides both attention and decisions. Yet, whether common or distinct mechanisms mediate each of these processes remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have often conflated the effect of reward expectation on sensory processing and decision-making because locations selected for sensory prioritization (sensitivity effects) were also prioritized for decisions (criterion effects).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we identify distinct forms of reward expectation that separably control spatial attention and decisional biases in human cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensitivity and criterion were independently modulated when expected rewards varied across locations (“space-specific”) or choices (“choice-specific”), respectively. Only sensitivity, not criterion, modulations reflected a limited, conserved attentional resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Established neural and physiological signatures of attention, including gain modulation of event-related potentials, alpha-band power lateralization, and eye-movement biases, were elicited only by space-specific reward modulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, neural correlates of decisional biases, including pre-stimulus alpha power suppression, selectively accompanied choice-specific reward modulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attention-related neural markers predicted sensitivity modulation by space-specific reward expectation but not criterion modulation by choice-specific reward expectation, indicating their distinct underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings uncover fundamentally dissociable behavioral and neural underpinnings of reward expectation effects on sensory and decisional selection, with critical implications for understanding how reward, attention, and choice are linked in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 18:32:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE01LVVTMFRnOHpEbFZQYjhzOWc5bEtrVlhwaGhMYzc0UnhpVDMyTm9uckk0OFNRcmp0VjFRcy1CamxnVFM5YjZzQjB4OEtmQ05tSk1HN19iaHl6c0JkbTJTTDB4aVpoZHBTaVZYZmtEckpUWTQ</guid></item><item><title>化合物可能有助于治疗某些神经系统疾病-美国国立卫生研究院（ NIH ） | (.gov)</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxNcFVMVW95QVJaTnZEWlRlaUYyaGxZUGE2MTVZbFgwWGFGUUxkcHpxY2pyWG0ycXN1N19PT1F2a2ZMU2dZRUtYV3FiMjZpbTVkRFYwQ0VPTV9yR1RQbi1IYkNfbEhSajczdjVhM1BnTmk3SzhKbTdZdmQwQVlLZXNGb1NIWW5yOG9vNkJ3ZmNVdVhEdkx1U1VEZUF6ZDhXdnJZbHhaYXBmYUZyMVNV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="usa-media-block__body"&gt;

It’s possible they had a mild fever and a little rash and never sought the medical care that would have added their case &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;to a map&lt;/a&gt; kept by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s also possible that the virus was shed by someone traveling through from Montana, Washington, Canada or elsewhere. Maybe they went back to their hometown in another state and got tested and reported there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no way to know for sure, Hahn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two states neighboring Idaho’s panhandle have each reported &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;10-49 cases&lt;/a&gt; so far this year, according to the CDC. But Idaho has had zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wastewater detection won’t be translated into reporting a case,” Hahn said by phone. “Right now, we really can’t say if this indicates one person or more than one person.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dashboard for WastewaterSCAN, a national wastewater monitoring system based at Stanford University, first reported measles in wastewater treated at the Coeur d’Alene Water Resource Recovery Facility on July 29. Then, on July 31, it reported &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=CjUQASABSABSBjEwNTZmMFIGY2QwODhiUgZlNTk1ODVaB01lVl9Sb3l4KooBBmQxNDg5MMABAQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=d14890"&gt;higher levels&lt;/a&gt; of the virus in that wastewater. Still, the level of measles in the wastewater is marked as low: Two out of five samples in the 10 days prior to the last sample date were positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many communities in the state don’t even do that kind of testing, Hahn said. The city of Boise, which treats wastewater for itself, Garden City and Eagle, hasn’t detected the disease, according to &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=CjUQASABSABSBjEwNTZmMFIGY2QwODhiUgZlNTk1ODVaB01lVl9Sb3l4KooBBmQxNDg5MMABAQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=d14890"&gt;the dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. It is the only other community in the state that tests its wastewater for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus found in Coeur d’Alene’s wastewater is a wild type, a label used to distinguish between measles that is naturally occurring and the diminished form of measles in the vaccine, Hahn explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You may be aware that the measles vaccine is a weakened, live virus,” Hahn said. “So if you get your measles shot, you might actually shed a little bit of that virus into the sewer system, and that would just show up as a vaccine strain, not as a wild type.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said people should consider checking whether they’re protected, especially parents who are gearing up to send their children back to school or people planning to go on a trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine for measles is very effective because it offers, in most cases, lifetime protection, Hahn said. Children are recommended to get two doses, once when they turn 1-year-old and once before they start kindergarten, at about age 4 or 5. Boosters aren’t needed. But if you can’t remember if you were previously vaccinated, it doesn’t hurt to get the two doses again just to be sure, Hahn said. Or, you could get blood drawn and an antibody test that will tell you whether you’re immune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="11" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maybe those old immunization records are still hanging around somewhere in a drawer, and you can double check,” Hahn said. “If you’re going to go and international travel, or you are a health care worker, it is recommended that you have documentation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said Idaho has imperfect data, but according to the annual National Immunization Survey, nearly 80% of kindergarteners in the 2023-24 school year were vaccinated, leaving about 20% unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think you&lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374862"&gt; might have measles&lt;/a&gt;, or have been exposed to someone with measles, and develop a fever or rash, public health officials recommend staying home, isolating yourself from others and calling your doctor or a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="14" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles has been surging nationwide. The CDC reported on Tuesday the highest number of annual &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt; since the U.S. &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/well/measles-doctors-treatment.html"&gt;declared measles eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. Most of the cases are connected to an outbreak that began in a Mennonite community in West Texas and spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas, &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/health/measles-outbreak-map.html"&gt;The New York Times reported&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the Texas and New Mexico cases have been among people who are unvaccinated, according to the Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wastewater testing is a valuable public health tool because it can detect the presence of infectious diseases, like measles, before cases are even reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel like it’s a signal,” Hahn said. “Measles is very contagious, and so the wastewater itself is just our canary in the coal mine, as it were, telling us that measles is in the community. It’s just one more reminder that measles is still out there circulating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-108" class="zone zone-el" index="17" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;August 5, 2025 at 11:27 AM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;div class="related-stories story-module"&gt;

(WLOS) — &lt;/span&gt;Health officials confirm an investigation is underway after a person with a confirmed case of tuberculosis (TB) spent time in Jackson County during their infectious period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an Aug. 5, 2025, news release, the Jackson County Department of Public Health (JCDPH) said it is working with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services Division of Public Health on the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the TB diagnosis was confirmed, county officials said they took immediate steps to protect the public, including isolating and treating the infected individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/back-to-school/13th-whooping-cough-case-confirmed-haywood-county-health-human-services-pertussis-prevention-vaccine-centers-disease-control" target="_blank" title="https://wlos.com/news/back-to-school/13th-whooping-cough-case-confirmed-haywood-county-health-human-services-pertussis-prevention-vaccine-centers-disease-control" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;13TH WHOOPING COUGH CASE CONFIRMED IN HAYWOOD COUNTY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A detailed contact investigation is also underway to identify people who may have been exposed to the disease. Jackson County officials said those identified as having close contact with the TB case will be notified directly by a public health official and offered testing, education, and follow-up care at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Our priority is the health and well-being of everyone in Jackson County," Public Health Director Anna Lippard said. "We are working carefully to identify and support those who may have been exposed, and we're committed to keeping the community informed every step of the way. If you have not been contacted directly by the health department, there is no need to seek testing at this time."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although TB is a serious disease, county officials say it is treatable and the risk to the general public remains low. Those with questions or concerns are asked to contact the JCDPH at 828-586-8994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/haywood-county-deputy-bitten-dogs-attack-unvaccinated-rabies-vaccinations-animal-services-incident-shelter-citation-fines-offense-community-pets-safety-precaution-cats-ferrets" target="_blank" title="https://wlos.com/news/local/haywood-county-deputy-bitten-dogs-attack-unvaccinated-rabies-vaccinations-animal-services-incident-shelter-citation-fines-offense-community-pets-safety-precaution-cats-ferrets" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;HAYWOOD COUNTY DEPUTY BITTEN BY UNVACCINATED DOGS, RABIES VACCINATIONS STRESSED&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About tuberculosis &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-data/2024-provisional/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-data/2024-provisional/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;provisional report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, the number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the country has been increasing since 2021. The report stated there were 10,347 TB cases in the U.S. in 2024, up from 9,633 cases in 2023. North Carolina followed the nationwide trend, with 215 cases reported in 2023 and 250 cases in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active cases of tuberculosis often affect the lungs and spread through the air when coughing, speaking, or singing. It is not spread through casual contact, like touching surfaces, shaking hands, or sharing food or drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson County officials said those sick with TB often have one or more of these symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough lasting more than 3 weeks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coughing up blood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Profuse sweating at night, often soaking the bed sheets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unintentional weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain or discomfort&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty breathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/prevention/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;CDC.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for more information on the disease and prevention measures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WLOS</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 17:07:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwJBVV95cUxPRzZFTlU5NzJydFIxNTFNb3ctZ0FGOV85NmpYVXlENnB0NlhxQWVqY1JBa3dWRW1FbU45bFN0aGdCWjR4anFiUHdDSmpjVlJJYnRXTnA2c3ZUTWhQWWpVS3g5eHhKZXJ4R29sY3Q1MkxUSEpqemFyRWVtMGhjTnMtWXY0ZVdPcm5xdUl5Y2M2dTF2bVZGdkExM2F5VThTQWU4NWR4NjNLLWFyNHQwZW9MME92ZklSS0o5WDJRSGRhLURHWW5yZHZMRzFqN2E3R3pHNW9ONjN0OU05WGxtVUljODFrbWVQY1N0UmFnR0dPdUtNa2VDYjNmejc3QmVaa3pPbmp0d1hUZldabjZPem0zY1pkSFo0S0h5YlFv</guid></item><item><title>夏季COVID-19感染最严重的地方：阿拉巴马州的坏消息- AL.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="W43EX56IP5DI7F5UPNQFDVFMRY"&gt;Alabama is among a handful of states with a high level of COVID-19 virus in the sewage system, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_2-weekly-national-summary" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_2-weekly-national-summary"&gt;according to data the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; released Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NGQEHWUEENBAZIQ2U7OIHK2WYY"&gt;Scientists test wastewater to determine the prevalence of infections, aiming to capture those who may or may not be symptomatic or visit the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VFUV3AFTJFARPGTNQFCS6SHFDY"&gt;While for most of the country, &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5435181-covid-19-emergency-visits-increase/?tbref=hp" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5435181-covid-19-emergency-visits-increase/?tbref=hp"&gt;wastewater viral activity level for coronavirus is currently&lt;/a&gt; low, Alabama is one of seven states where it is high.
