In a double-blind study, patients experienced marked improvements after three weeks of daily, noninvasive ultrasound sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology directly modulates deep brain activity without surgery or medications, offering new hope for treatment-resistant mood disorders. The study also demonstrated a strong safety profile, supporting future large-scale clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct Brain Modulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Focused ultrasound safely targets the amygdala without invasive surgery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptom Relief:&lt;/strong&gt; Patients showed significant improvements in depression, anxiety, and PTSD after three weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising Safety:&lt;/strong&gt; No serious adverse events were reported, paving the way for larger clinical trials.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UT Austin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patients suffering from depression, anxiety and trauma-related disorders experienced significant relief from their symptoms after a new treatment that uses sound waves to modulate deep brain activity, according to new research from Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at Austin. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study, published this month in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, demonstrates that low-intensity focused ultrasound technology can safely and effectively target the amygdala, a brain region known to be hyperactive in mood and anxiety disorders, without surgery or invasive procedures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109289"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-PTSD-depression-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-PTSD-depression-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-PTSD-depression-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-PTSD-depression-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-PTSD-depression-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-PTSD-depression-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-PTSD-depression-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-PTSD-depression-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-PTSD-depression-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-PTSD-depression-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-PTSD-depression-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-PTSD-depression-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-PTSD-depression-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-PTSD-depression-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-PTSD-depression-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In the double-blind study, 29 patients with various mood and anxiety disorders received MRI-guided focused ultrasound to the left amygdala.

A sizable number of patients do not respond to first-line treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive neuromodulation is a second-line treatment approach, but current methods rely on cortical targets to indirectly modulate subcortical structures, e.g., the amygdala, implicated in MATRDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is a non-invasive technique for direct subcortical neuromodulation, but its safety, feasibility, and promise as a potential treatment is largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a target engagement study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided tFUS to the left amygdala was administered during functional MRI (tFUS/fMRI) to test for acute modulation of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in a double-blind, within-subject, sham-controlled design in patients with MATRDs (N = 29) and healthy comparison subjects (N = 23).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an unblinded treatment trial, the same patients then underwent 3-week daily (15 sessions) MRI-guided repetitive tFUS (rtFUS) to the left amygdala to examine safety, feasibility, symptom change, and change in amygdala reactivity to emotional faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active vs. sham tFUS/fMRI reduced, on average, left amygdala BOLD signal and produced patient-related differences in hippocampal and insular responses. rtFUS was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were significant reductions on the primary outcome (Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire General Distress subscale; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001, Cohen’s &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; = 0.77), secondary outcomes (Cohen’s &lt;em&gt;d of&lt;/em&gt; 0.43–1.50), and amygdala activation to emotional stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings provide initial evidence of tFUS capability to modulate amygdala function, rtFUS safety and feasibility in MATRDs, and motivate double-blind randomized controlled trials to examine efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 12:45:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE1GQXp4N2hkNWVkcUd3Y0cwVDloODJfZXpMbmt3OEtlWEpjc1licHpWVW5YZ3NtREIwdEIydDdDSnUxekoyUWx6MDFlcnR4THFxZWdMaW9iVzhQb3c2UWhvUWtxczd6eHJvUW13QlFoeFItQlVJeVZxX0wwNkNGbUE</guid></item><item><title>超加工食品与全球过早死亡人数上升相关-神经科学新闻 | Ultraprocessed Foods Linked to Rising Premature Deaths Worldwide - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE1jeUtEY3pUMVBxMC14NEoycnBKZlcxa2ZUX251MXI0eVRLdjE2VElVR2VBNXZYeHZyYnhLT2xNSEVUTW4yaS1GYjZ0UWRHeDhRa28zUXB3alZjWURQRlNRVUhkdW9CbG0yWjhMMkJJekVqNVFt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study across eight countries shows that higher consumption of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) is significantly linked to increased premature deaths. Researchers found that each 10% rise in UPFs’ share of total energy intake raises all-cause mortality risk by 3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries with the highest UPF consumption, like the U.S., see up to 14% of premature deaths attributed to these foods. The findings highlight the urgent need for global policies promoting healthier, minimally processed diets to protect public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPF-Mortality Link:&lt;/strong&gt; A 10% increase in ultraprocessed food intake raises all-cause mortality risk by 3%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Burden:&lt;/strong&gt; In high-UPF countries like the U.S., nearly 14% of premature deaths are linked to UPF consumption.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urgent Action Needed:&lt;/strong&gt; Policies promoting fresh, minimally processed foods are essential to curb rising deaths globally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Elsevier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study analyzing data from nationally representative dietary surveys and mortality data from eight countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, United Kingdom, and United States) shows that premature deaths attributable to consumption of ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) increase significantly according to their share in individuals’ total energy intake. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, appearing in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/em&gt; reinforces the call for global action to reduce UPF consumption, supported by regulatory and fiscal policies that foster healthier environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPFs are ready-to-eat-or-heat industrial formulations that are made with ingredients extracted from foods or synthesized in laboratories, with little or no whole foods in their composition. These have gradually been replacing traditional foods and meals made from fresh and minimally processed ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead investigator of the study Eduardo Augusto Fernandes Nilson, DSc, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), Brazil, says, “UPFs affect health beyond the individual impact of high content of critical nutrients (sodium, trans fats, and sugar) because of the changes in the foods during industrial processing and the use of artificial ingredients, including colorants, artificial flavors and sweeteners, emulsifiers, and many other additives and processing aids, so assessing deaths from all-causes associated with UPF consumption allows an overall estimate of the effect of industrial food processing on health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous studies focused on specific dietary risk factors instead of food patterns, the current study modeled data from nationally representative dietary surveys and mortality data from eight countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, United Kingdom, and United States) to link dietary patterns, considering the extent and purpose of industrial food processing, to deaths from all causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nilson explains, “We first estimated a linear association between the dietary share of UPFs and all-cause mortality, so that each 10% increase in the participation of UPFs in the diet increases the risk of death from all causes by 3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then, using the relative risks and the food consumption data for all countries (ranging from 15% of the total energy intake in Colombia, to over 50% of the calories in the United States), we built a model that estimated that the percentage of all-cause premature preventable deaths due to the consumption of UPFs can vary from 4% in countries with lower UPF consumption to almost 14% in countries with the highest UPF consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, in 2018, 124,000 premature deaths were attributable to the consumption of UPFs in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High consumption of UPFs has been associated with 32 different diseases, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, some types of cancer, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, this study has estimated the burden of UPF intake on premature deaths from all-causes in different countries, showing that the attributable mortality is significant in all settings and that addressing UPF consumption should be a global public nutrition priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nilson notes, “It is concerning that, while in high-income countries UPF consumption is already high but relatively stable for over a decade, in low- and middle-income countries the consumption has continuously increased, meaning that while the attributable burden in high-income countries is currently higher, it is growing in the other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This shows that policies that disincentivize the consumption of UPFs are urgently needed globally, promoting traditional dietary patterns based on local fresh and minimally processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and mortality research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.elsevier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Astrid Engelen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.elsevier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elsevier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Astrid Engelen – Elsevier&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2025.02.018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Premature Mortality Attributable to Ultraprocessed Food Consumption in 8 Countries&lt;/a&gt;” by Eduardo A.F.

Prospective cohort studies have consistently found an association between high consumption of ultraprocessed foods and increased risk of several noncommunicable diseases and all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study aimed to (1) estimate the risk of all-cause mortality for ultraprocessed foods consumption and (2) estimate the attributable epidemiologic burden of ultraprocessed food consumption in 8 select countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, a dose–response meta-analysis of observational cohort studies was performed to assess the association between ultraprocessed food consumption and all-cause mortality and estimated the pooled RR for all-cause mortality per each 10% increment in the percentage ultraprocessed food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the population attributable fractions for premature all-cause mortality attributable to the ultraprocessed foods in consumption were estimated in 8 select countries with relatively low (Colombia and Brazil), intermediate (Chile and Mexico), and high (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and the U.S.) ultraprocessed food consumption. Analysis was conducted in November 2023–July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meta-analysis showed a linear dose–response association between the ultraprocessed food consumption and all-cause mortality (RR for each 10% increase in percentage ultraprocessed food=1.03; 95% CI=1.02, 1.04).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the magnitude of the association between ultraprocessed foods intake and all-cause mortality and the ultraprocessed food dietary share number (percentage ultraprocessed food) in each of the 8 selected countries, estimations varied from 4% (Colombia) to 14% (United Kingdom and U.S.) of premature deaths attributable to ultraprocessed food intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings support that ultraprocessed food intake contributes significantly to the overall burden of disease in many countries, and its reduction should be included in national dietary guideline recommendations and addressed in public policies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 12:19:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE1jeUtEY3pUMVBxMC14NEoycnBKZlcxa2ZUX251MXI0eVRLdjE2VElVR2VBNXZYeHZyYnhLT2xNSEVUTW4yaS1GYjZ0UWRHeDhRa28zUXB3alZjWURQRlNRVUhkdW9CbG0yWjhMMkJJekVqNVFt</guid></item><item><title>吃一种含有“关键”营养素的水果可以帮助血压- Surrey Live | Blood pressure can be helped by eating one fruit with 'crucial' nutrient - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOY1hsX252UEd5cjVySmpKN0ZIbi15MVdZaTdNT1FDdTIzQlBxYm5jNnRhcTJwMWsydE44WXJBSHBJVmZNSVFwS1M2ZlQwNDBHOS1oZzBWTzdtd3lZd0FmZGVVQWtXRi1mQlFoN0lWR01EZjIwSFdIQ3JraF9lQTRfVkZlcGNreE5N?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of us probably don't need telling that &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/eat-30-plants-week-improve-30701080" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;eating a wide variety of fruit and vegetables is good for our health&lt;/a&gt;. The more you can eat over the course of, say, a week, the more nutrients you will be getting into your body and the healthier &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/gut-health-score-93-out-30672961" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;your gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; will be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Similarly, most of us will also have heard a lot about the importance of vitamins to your body's health. But there are many other important nutrients that we hear a lot less about, despite their essential role in how our body functions. One of those is magnesium. So important is it, in fact, that it is involved in more than 300 reactions in the body, registered dietitian Patricia Bannan &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/fruits-with-high-magnesium-rcna202425" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;told Today&lt;/a&gt;. But "despite its importance, about half of US adults don’t get enough magnesium from food", she added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are simple ways to increase your magnesium intake — and they don't need to involve obscure and expensive foods or supplements. You can get more magnesium from eating the sorts of foods you can come across easily in any supermarket.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Why is magnesium important?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Magnesium is a mineral that helps several bodily functions, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;turning the food we eat into energy&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; making sure our cells, organs and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9820677/#:~:text=Magnesium%20(Mg)%20is%20involved%20in,of%20the%20blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;brains are functioning as they should&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;stabilising moods&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;maintaining our muscles&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;aiding vitamin D in travelling around the body&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;making sure the glands which aid bone health work normally.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; It may also play a role in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/5/429?ref=circle-magazine-health-wellness-genetics-blog" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;improving symptoms of anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28654669/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;mild depression&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35184264/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;help improve sleep&lt;/a&gt;. There's also evidence that good magnesium levels helps your heart health and one review of evidence found that people with higher intakes of magnesium had an &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/glossary#meta-analysis" rel="nofollow"&gt;8% lower chance of developing high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; than those with the lowest intakes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;section data-embed-group="read-more" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt; &lt;aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What fruit is high in magnesium?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; You can get magnesium in lots of fruits, but topping the list is the &lt;b&gt;passion fruit&lt;/b&gt; , which contains 68 grams of magnesium per cup (a cup is a US measure equivalent to about 250ml in the UK — it's harder to convert that into grams). One &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00617/full" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;study in the Frontiers in Pharmacology journal&lt;/a&gt; said that "more than 110 phytochemical constituents" have already been found in the plant which shows "a wide range of health effects and biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-hypertensive, anti-tumor, antidiabetic, hypolipidemic activities". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It adds: "These outstanding results suggest that passion fruit may offer a range of health benefits, such as managing inflammatory and neurological disease, and also preventing some chronic diseases like hypertension and hyperlipidemia."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today.com notes that "the pulp of the aromatic fruit can be eaten raw, as a yogurt topping, or added to juices and drinks" and adds that it "also tops the list of fruits with the most protein".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What other foods are high in magnesium?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are lots of other good sources of magnesium, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;leafy green vegetables like spinach or chard&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;nuts and seeds like almonds, chia seeds and pumpkin seeds&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fruits like guava, banana, papaya, blackberries, kiwi and figs.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rebecca McManamon, consultant dietitian and British Dietetic Association spokesperson, told the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/bbc"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; that you are probably reaching the recommended daily amount of magnesium if you’re eating unsalted nuts or wholegrains daily, along with a variety of fruit, green vegetables and legumes. She added: "If these are not foods you eat regularly, you may be at a higher risk of not getting enough magnesium." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 11:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOY1hsX252UEd5cjVySmpKN0ZIbi15MVdZaTdNT1FDdTIzQlBxYm5jNnRhcTJwMWsydE44WXJBSHBJVmZNSVFwS1M2ZlQwNDBHOS1oZzBWTzdtd3lZd0FmZGVVQWtXRi1mQlFoN0lWR01EZjIwSFdIQ3JraF9lQTRfVkZlcGNreE5N</guid></item><item><title>塑料中的常见化学物质与超过35万人死于心脏病有关--《华盛顿邮报》 | Common chemicals in plastic linked to over 350,000 deaths from heart disease - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxNRjRNZFlIaF9lTG1YcEhfNFdwV185NldQUHZTRlVCN2tSVFdSMGF0WEJldmUxSmg4Z0RlQVhQU0dCR3FZZ29HS0Q1eGV4VGVuLWQtQlVIa2ViaVVrYktQeENTaFZoVl9vZGhwZFBwUTBpSVFqRDAzTGN4R3QyTE1tNDVJYlB1MVZIcks2Sk1VSWE1amJyMG5DMU9adUh0aWRVMzg3bmxqczVxTVIteHRxV09B?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z7KSUJDDXJB3NHGJFGXAPLMBSM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A set of chemicals found in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/16/more-than-3000-chemicals-food-packaging-have-infiltrated-our-bodies/"&gt;food packaging&lt;/a&gt;, plastics, and lotions and shampoos has been linked to hundreds of thousands of deaths from heart disease, according to a study &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105730" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in the journal eBioMedicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GXZUPHGSBFANNL4K643MRAUGYI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These chemicals, known as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/12/02/phthalates-perfume-safe-health-risks/"&gt;phthalates &lt;/a&gt;(pronounced tha-lates), were responsible for more than 350,000 deaths worldwide in 2018, researchers found. About 75 percent of the deaths were in Asia, the Middle East and the Pacific — reflecting growing concern about the amount of plastic&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;proliferating in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5UZI5AXDGNE35BAJRTTAI7Y3EU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We think of plastics as an issue in high-income countries,” said Leonardo Trasande, a professor at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine and one of the authors of the paper. “But what we’re seeing in the pattern geographically is disturbing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FIAT5ZKQKRGQPHAD7JNEX5462I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While the researchers acknowledge that exposure to phthalates coincides with other risk factors — such as obesity and metabolic disorders — the findings add to the growing evidence that chemicals used in plastics &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/02/24/black-plastic-utensils-toxic-flame-retardants/" target="_blank"&gt;come with serious health risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DP2FVCZS6VECPKRNL3NUX5HVP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Phthalates are a set of chemicals that are added to plastic to make it more stretchy, soft or flexible. In lotions, shampoos and perfumes, phthalates can be used to retain&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;scents. But the chemicals — which are so common&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;that some researchers call them “everywhere chemicals” — have attracted widespread concern from scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UZTLCOASEJH4FL7CY7AXXYWFDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In epidemiological studies, phthalates have been linked to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25697839/" target="_blank"&gt;male fertility problems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389423009639" target="_blank"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9870605/" target="_blank"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32895790/" target="_blank"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;. The United States allows nine kinds of phthalates to be used in food packaging. They are an example of what scientists call “&lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/topics/edc/what-edcs-are/common-edcs"&gt;endocrine-disrupting chemicals&lt;/a&gt;,” which can tweak and change the hormones in the body, causing multiple health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WUO633LGRJENPCMOUZED77RLYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We already know that phthalates are toxic chemicals,” said Tracey Woodruff, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive health at the University of California at San Francisco, who was not involved in the study. In recent years, she pointed out, scientists and environmental organizations have pushed lawmakers to get phthalates out of food packaging and other plastics. “This just shows why that’s a good idea,” Woodruff added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P3ODGJQZHNBCRPL4PVISLD2RV4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kevin Ott, the executive director of the Flexible Vinyl Alliance, which represents the makers of polyvinyl chloride, said in an email that many studies on the health risks of phthalates do not meet the highest standards of evidence. The Food and Drug Administration confirmed as recently as 2018 that phthalates are not clearly linked with any health effects, Ott added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2UREAV46LBGGVNWOZEFELK3HME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The new study drew on surveys from around the globe that evaluated exposure to food pack, one particular type of phthalate, through urine samples. Researchers then matched exposure to the chemical to increased risk of cardiovascular death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O6ZIJ26ACNHRHKCNIGLCO7HRXY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;They found that phthalates contributed to 13 percent of all deaths from heart disease in people between ages 55 and 64 globally. In the United States, it was around 10 percent. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide: In 2021, an estimated 20 million people died because of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TTECCONT4ZCGHIKFN7EORPSDHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Trasande says that while 13 percent may seem like a high number, phthalate exposure may overlap with and exacerbate other risks. Phthalates are believed to create excess inflammation in the body, and they are linked with other conditions that increase heart disease mortality, such as obesity and high blood pressure. Some of the increased risk of heart disease from obesity, for example, could be from phthalates.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The chemicals are also found more commonly in highly processed foods, another risk factor for death from heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SFMYAPCRKJDQHIDRNVWM2WAYZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Scientists estimate that air pollution, which contains tiny plastic particles, is linked to 20 percent of all cardiovascular deaths globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZTAY4YH73NCSTA5JSUON3XHZMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; — albeit with a small sample size — has also found that the presence of microplastics or &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/08/microplastics-nanoplastics-bottled-water-study/"&gt;nanoplastics &lt;/a&gt;in the carotid artery increases the risk of heart attack, stroke or death. Researchers are trying to understand the extent to which those tiny plastics can carry chemicals like phthalates with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FN6LZ3SQ3ZCSNO7LJSHSEOOUF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But people with more phthalates in their bodies are probably more exposed to plastics, and therefore to microplastics and nanoplastics as well, Trasande said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z3GNQSITMVFD5NEQ7APXUB545M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It could be the chemicals that are being delivered, or it could be the micro and nanoplastics,” said Trasande. “And that’s really where the field needs to go scientifically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IG4247DYFJF55MVISMICOK7TPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Other research looking at deaths from phthalates has come to similar results. One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39680769/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published late last year found that phthalates were responsible for about 164,000 deaths worldwide in 2015, most due to heart disease and high blood pressure. That study examined just 40 countries, while the new study looked at around 190.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J6QW3HLB7BBRXMYUHUOI7JKTME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7570088/#sec4-jcdd-07-00026"&gt;animal studies&lt;/a&gt; have also found connections between phthalates and heart disease, some researchers say more human studies would help solidify the link. “It would be important to have someone do a systematic review on phthalates and cardiovascular events,” said Woodruff. “But it’s just a new area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3OVKDOXSLRH3ZAUSEYSVQLCJ24" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For now, scientists continue to push for more monitoring of the chemicals in plastic. In most countries around the world, companies are not required to reveal chemical additives to plastics, which include things like phthalates, BPA and flame retardants. Many of those plastics end up in low-income countries along with &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/04/plastic-waste-burned-study/"&gt;mountains of plastic waste&lt;/a&gt; for recycling or disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="STVTM6ZTBVDDDLA7BI57GTS4P4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“They are the receivers of all the plastic garbage,” Woodruff said. “And the phthalates are going to be there, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:31:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxNRjRNZFlIaF9lTG1YcEhfNFdwV185NldQUHZTRlVCN2tSVFdSMGF0WEJldmUxSmg4Z0RlQVhQU0dCR3FZZ29HS0Q1eGV4VGVuLWQtQlVIa2ViaVVrYktQeENTaFZoVl9vZGhwZFBwUTBpSVFqRDAzTGN4R3QyTE1tNDVJYlB1MVZIcks2Sk1VSWE1amJyMG5DMU9adUh0aWRVMzg3bmxqczVxTVIteHRxV09B</guid></item><item><title>根据骨科医生的说法，如何在中年预防受伤并进行更智能的训练- MindBodyGreen | How To Prevent Injuries &amp; Train Smarter In Midlife, According To Orthopedic Surgeons - MindBodyGreen</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxNUzYzWXZiYlBNd00tUUdZUzRZNjFON3RuTlNnTGpJNGROZy1oVFFMQmx2OTVyM0VnMlFqS1hQWHh3OE5pMzhQbGhFU0JwOW9FYk5rSE5RWVNid1NYMUdCNXpFc2JLT01RYjVaOWIxQUM3OEZRcGdDTWo5V3hFWnNHUEdEc3lqOHBzeXVxdmI3UmliV3ZqY0t3dXVZN25mREpLS1hUTVpwbVMxcjlfaXUxZWNkcTBDTnNzM25FRjdoaWU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span id="content"&gt;&lt;div end="false" class="sc-11rlt5o-4 gjIquG"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve spent too long talking about fitness as a way to shrink ourselves.

Some research shows that higher fiber intake is associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer.&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One reason might be that it supports a healthy gut microbiome, which can aid in cancer prevention,” Tan says. For example, a 2021 systematic review in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Nutrition &lt;/em&gt;identified a link between oat consumption and an increase in beneficial gut bacteria.&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a half-cup of whole grain rolled oats contains about 5 grams of fiber, and our Creamy Blueberry-Pecan Oatmeal recipe contains 6 grams of fiber per serving.&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt; That’s around 21% of the Daily Value for fiber.&lt;strong&gt;17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Berries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Foods with phytochemicals, which are compounds found in vegetables, fruit, beans and nuts, may slow cancer cell growth,” Tan says.&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries are rich in a type of phytochemical called anthocyanin, which helps give the fruit its deep blue color and may reduce inflammation and free radicals.&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt; Plus, research has shown that berries may be associated with a lower risk of cancer.&lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Components in berries also have been shown to reduce the growth of precancerous cells,” Tan says.&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; This makes these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:antioxidant powerhouses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;antioxidant powerhouses&lt;/a&gt; a go-to oatmeal topping, especially given that you can rinse a handful of berries and toss them on top of your oatmeal in less time than it would take to watch a TikTok video. Plus, they’re absolutely delicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/275617/why-you-should-eat-the-rainbow-when-it-comes-to-fruits-and-vegetables/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The #1 Eating Habit to Gain the Biggest Benefits From the Mediterranean Diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The #1 Eating Habit to Gain the Biggest Benefits From the Mediterranean Diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nuts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from adding a nice, crunchy texture to the mix, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nuts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt; like pecans or almonds help round out this quick and easy breakfast by offering healthy fats, fiber and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291111/the-10-best-vegan-protein-sources/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plant-based protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More comprehensive studies are needed, but findings from a 2021 review suggested that eating more nuts may be associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer and lower cancer mortality.&lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt; Almonds, pecans and many other nuts contain naturally occurring compounds called polyphenols, which may improve gut health. A 2018 randomized controlled trial, for example, found that walnuts may increase the amount of good bacteria in the gut microbiome.&lt;strong&gt;13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts are also anti-inflammatory, “and we know that inflammation is associated with developing cancer,” Tan says. Some research has found a strong connection between cancer and chronic inflammation.&lt;strong&gt;14&lt;/strong&gt; To top it all off, nuts are rich in antioxidant-rich compounds like vitamin E, which may help protect the body from cell damage over time.&lt;strong&gt;15,16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Breakfast Options To Reduce Cancer Risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking for some more breakfast ideas that could reduce inflammation, improve gut health and support your overall health? Here are three more recipes to try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269639/old-fashioned-oatmeal/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Old-Fashioned Oatmeal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Old-Fashioned Oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;: The options are endless with oats, and this recipe encourages you to get creative with your favorite toppings — like nut butter, crushed almonds, berries, spices or even yogurt. Like other oat dishes, this one is packed with essential nutrients, including plant-based protein, fiber, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290631/what-is-a-complex-carbohydrate/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:complex carbohydrates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;complex carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;, vitamins and minerals. And it could easily tick all the boxes in our oncologist-approved breakfast recommendations: whole grains, nuts and berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/255762/quinoa-chia-oatmeal-mix/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Quinoa &amp;amp; Chia Oatmeal Mix;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Quinoa &amp;amp; Chia Oatmeal Mix&lt;/a&gt;: This hot cereal uplevels your standard bowl of oats with the addition of nutrient-dense whole grains like quinoa and rolled wheat or barley. Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-11705262" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chia seeds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; for an extra boost of protein, fiber and antioxidants, such as omega-3 fatty acids. One serving provides 6 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber. Consider topping it with Greek yogurt for additional protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7938472/overnight-matcha-oats-with-berries/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Overnight Matcha Oats with Berries;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Overnight Matcha Oats with Berries&lt;/a&gt;: This recipe features whole-grain old-fashioned oats, antioxidant-rich berries and polyphenol-packed sliced almonds, among other nutrient-dense ingredients like chia seeds and matcha. It’s filling to boot, with 27 grams of protein and 11 grams of fiber per serving. Plus, you can make it the night before to eliminate some of the morning rush chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an oncologist-approved breakfast, consider a warm, comforting bowl of oatmeal topped with nuts and berries. It’s loaded with fiber, antioxidants, phytochemicals and other nutrients that may help reduce cancer risk. And it’s tasty enough that you’ll probably want to have it on a regular basis. No breakfast food guarantees protection against cancer, but this nutrient-rich meal may give your overall health a boost in a way that could protect it against some types of cancer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-an-oncologist-has-for-breakfast-11722729" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 09:51:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9iMWJEM2QxMDgtZFFaYWhvSWJTOTRMMDBLMy1lM01fUWl4SVV1ZkN2dXc4WW5salBoaWtVaElZRlRxQjdCSHdjRmthT2EycDBOQ3B3dmZqR3pZbC1UcFdGWUtWX3YyMklQWkVvdGdybzZjeGs</guid></item><item><title>爸爸的文本是艺术作品。向我们发送您的收藏夹。-《纽约时报》 | Dad Texts Are Works of Art.

&lt;p&gt;Exercising before bed might seem counterintuitive, and generally it's a good idea to avoid intense activity late in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some gentle movement could actually relax your body and brain, and help you sleep better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/evening-activity-for-better-sleep-otago-study?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/evening-activity-for-better-sleep-otago-study?utm_source=chatgpt.com" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that participants who did just three minutes of exercise every 30 minutes over a four-hour period in the evening slept for nearly 30 minutes longer, on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemma Folkard, a Pilates instructor and the founder of online platform &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/shape_pilates/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/shape_pilates/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Shape Pilates&lt;/a&gt;, agrees and recently posted on Instagram that better sleep is one of the biggest benefits of exercise she experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I caught up with Folkard to find out more and she shared a gentle Pilates routine to end your day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A pre-bed Pilates session may include the moves you normally do in class, but the difference is how you do them and what your intent is," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each exercise should be executed with the intention of being gentle with yourself and your nervous system, moving with ease, and allowing the mind to slowly wind down rather than moving to build muscle or sweat," says Folkard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-37qQGv2xKCLrxu5C7LTxne" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-37qQGv2xKCLrxu5C7LTxne slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-gemma-folkard-s-evening-pilates-routine"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do Gemma Folkard's evening Pilates routine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id="1-breathwork-3"&gt;1.

Relax your eyes to soften your gaze, place your hands on the sides of your ribs and relax your shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inhale deeply, expanding the sides and back of your ribs so you move your hands out.

Those adding a little bit of&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/food-and-drink/cinnamon-products-lead-consumer-reports-b2614447.html"&gt; cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; to their sugar or hot beverage of choice aren't likely to have any issues, but consuming the spice in high doses could &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/health-and-wellbeing/gemma-collins-mounjaro-wegovy-ozempic-b2737810.html"&gt;cause complications&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Health concerns could arise if excessive amounts of supplements are consumed without the knowledge of health care provider or prescriber of the medications,” Shabana Khan, a principal scientist involved in the study, said. “Overconsumption of supplements could lead to a rapid clearance of the prescription medicine from the body, and that could result in making the medicine less effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary compound in cinnamon, cinnamaldehyde, can activate receptors in the body that actually breaks down certain medicines, researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also noted in the study that cinnamon oil — typically used in cooking and for toiletries — poses no risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is not the same for cinnamon bark.

    &lt;p&gt;Champagne and white wine “protect” the heart from cardiac arrest, new research has suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts found that drinking wine, eating more fruit and keeping slim were all linked to a lower risk of a sudden cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 30,000 Britons each year suffer an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (which is different from a heart attack). This occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating, and emergency resuscitation is required to start it again. Researchers said thousands of people could prevent it by tackling health and lifestyle issues, as they identified 56 risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an “intriguing” finding of the research was that champagne and white wine seemed to produce a “protective effect” on the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Fudan University in Shanghai, China, found that a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/alcohol/is-white-wine-healthier-than-we-think/"&gt;higher consumption of white wine&lt;/a&gt;, more fruit, a consistent positive mood, maintaining a healthy weight and keeping blood pressure under control all seemed to protect against a cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were more educated also seemed less prone to cardiac arrest, the study, published in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology, suggested. Poor sleep patterns and a lack of exercise could be detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;No ‘fed-up feelings’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified 56 risk factors associated with sudden cardiac arrest and found up to 63 per cent of cases might be avoidable if people changed unhealthy habits. It looked at 502,094 middle-aged to older people included in the UK Biobank’s data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of these, 3,147 people suffered sudden cardiac arrest during an average follow-up period of 13.8 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors concluded that between 40 per cent and 63 per cent of sudden cardiac arrest cases may be avoidable when looking at all 56 risk factors, which included lifestyle factors, socio-economic status, and the local environment, such as exposure to air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For lifestyle factors, researchers found that a higher consumption of champagne and/or white wine and fruit intake protected against cardiac arrest, while “fed-up” feelings, high body mass indexes (BMIs) and arm fat mass, high blood pressure, and lower education level all increased the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that the risk for regular champagne and white wine drinkers was about 30 per cent lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Huihuan Luo, the lead investigator from Fudan University, said: “The study found significant associations between various modifiable factors and sudden cardiac arrest, with lifestyle changes being the most impactful in preventing cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;‘More complex than previously assumed’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an accompanying editorial, Nicholas Grubic, from the University of Toronto, and Dakota Gustafson, from Queen’s University in Ontario, said: “One of the study’s most intriguing findings is the cardioprotective effect associated with champagne and white wine consumption, questioning long-held assumptions about the specificity of red wine’s cardioprotective properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research on the underlying mechanisms remains unclear, but these findings reinforce the idea that the benefits of moderate alcohol consumption may be more complex than previously assumed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found that the polyphenols found in wine, which have typically been associated with red wine, can play a role in &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/alcohol/is-red-wine-good-for-you"&gt;lowering blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and reducing the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These antioxidants can be found in all types of wine but are lower in white varieties. Despite this, the research suggests they may help to protect the body’s heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts believe the antioxidants found in alcoholic drinks can help to protect the heart and other body cells as well as the brain, with some researchers suggesting it can ward off dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the research, which found a link rather than cause, has not taken into account the other potential harms that alcohol can cause or whether there is a net benefit to having a glass of wine.&lt;/p&gt;

Right now, doctors rely on brain scans called PET scans to find amyloid plaques or do a spinal tap to check for abnormal levels of proteins like beta-amyloid and tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;These tests are expensive, invasive and not always easy to access. Blood tests could make it much simpler to find early signs of the disease and be more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If you get a diagnosis early, you're actually able to access treatments that you cannot take later on in the disease process," &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.alz.org/press/spokespeople/elizabeth-edgerly" target="_blank"&gt;Elizabeth Edgerly&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a clinical psychologist and Alzheimer's Association spokesperson, said in an interview with ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report highlights that diagnosing Alzheimer's earlier could open the door to treatments when they have the best chance of working, helping people stay mentally sharper for longer and giving families more time to plan for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the past two years, the FDA has approved two new drugs -- Leqembi and Kisunla -- that can slow the progression of early Alzheimer's. While they are not cures, they can help people preserve memory and thinking skills longer, offering more time with a better quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This marks a major shift from older Alzheimer's treatments, which could only manage symptoms without slowing down the disease much. However, these new drugs carry significant challenges, including high costs, the need for frequent brain scans to monitor serious side effects and the risk of swelling or bleeding in the brain. In addition, only people in the early stages of Alzheimer's are eligible to receive these treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Ultimately, we would love to see an array of treatments that are available that tackle different aspects of Alzheimer's, different factors that are contributing to it," Edgerly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She noted that more than 140 different treatments are now in development, aiming to target different symptoms and stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report also lays out an updated understanding of Alzheimer's risk factors, dividing them into two categories. Some risks -- like age, genetics and family history -- cannot be changed. Others -- including diet, exercise, blood pressure, cholesterol, hearing and vision health -- are within a person's control. Addressing the modifiable risks can have a significant impact on a person's Alzheimer's risk, the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In fact, Edgerly said that nearly half of all dementias could be preventable by taking better care of modifiable risks earlier in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;A nurse holds the hands of a person suffering from Alzheimer's disease on September 21, 2009 at Les Fontaines retirement home in Lutterbach , eastern France.

My last A1C test showed a value of 7.8%. I have been taking Mounjaro weekly, which lowered my weight by about 20 pounds and my A1C level by about 0.5%. I also take diltiazem for hypertension, a statin, and one metformin pill per day. I read an article in the newspaper stating that according to experts, an A1C of over 7% may be appropriate for "older people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;My question is, what is the definition of "older people"? Is it over 65 or even older? I am wondering if I still need to be overly concerned about my A1C reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— A.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear A.:&lt;/strong&gt; Although there are no clear studies to inform us of the ideal blood sugar control (the A1C is a measurement of your overall blood sugar during the past few months), expert groups try to balance the potential benefits of keeping sugar levels near normal (with its reduced risk of small blood vessel disease that can lead to kidney and nerve damage over time) against the potential harms from very tight blood sugar control (with its risk of dangerously low blood sugars).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Unfortunately, the term "older people" doesn't really help here. The critical issue is whether a person is in sufficiently good health to realize the benefits of good blood pressure control. An otherwise healthy 71-year-old absolutely has a life expectancy that makes blood sugar control important, which means an A1C level of 7.0% to 7.5% might be ideal. For older people with multiple medical issues, an A1C of 8% might be reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Studies like the ACCORD trial, which showed that a very low A1C goal of 6% led to worse outcomes than an A1C goal of 7% in people at a high risk for heart disease, were done at a time when the medicines we had were not always good for the heart. The Mounjaro you are taking reduces the risk of heart disease, and future studies may show that this class of medicines, along with others like the SGLT2 inhibitors, may completely change our understanding of blood glucose control and heart disease. It may be that in the future, "tighter" control of blood sugar may lead to better long-term outcomes, but it will take large trials to help sort this out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I have had a sore tongue for a month. I visited a doctor and got some ointment and mouthwash, but it hasn't cured it. What other steps should I take?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— G.W.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear G.W.:&lt;/strong&gt; If you haven't already, your first visit should be to a dentist who can do a comprehensive exam to look for other causes of tongue and mouth pain. Aphthous ulcers ("canker sores"), herpes virus ("cold sores"), dry mouth, allergic reactions and nutritional deficiencies are all possibilities. There are dermatologic diseases like a geographic tongue that can cause mouth or tongue pain. Fungal infections may also be the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Nerve diseases such as glossopharyngeal neuralgia and burning mouth syndrome could also cause symptoms. If your dentist and general physician haven't been able to help, a visit with a neurologist may be of benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I have had several patients become sensitive to sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), which is an ingredient in many toothpastes. Occasionally, simply switching to an SLS-free toothpaste solves the problem. &lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 04:04:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxNZWkwYVVGWGVGWU1fcS03aE43ZzhlMXJyeHJ0OVlsZG5vY2FmaDVMbjBnQ1BWVHA4ZlV3eTFzajBkRjJlbkp4cHVyekNOM00tQ1lNWnl4ZURVRHZXcTZ1clZrYXN1cGN3ZFVFRW8waHl1MU52N1ZwMGNhdDFkWGc0dzVtVHp4cF9nQlRzQ3Brb1VaM1RNemdXeDV4VWYtWVlQM0U2Sm5DOWltUDJfTldjWnVnTFVabVBCcksxNllIZWhrZWdmM3pnVXprNG5VdXc</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，家用塑料制品中的化学物质与心脏病死亡有关- CNN | Chemicals in household plastic products linked to heart disease deaths, study says - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPYjV0UUo3c19QZFNsTmxPTVowbTZaNFZPTDJ3RlVzR3JXUkEwMDM0QVUyQlBiNnVlSXJTcGZLa21EdHdxekVNWnBoblNrOHlrZ1B0VHExWXo0VmtTSmkwYTlLUF9GMThRU2ZkRWVTUjhKeWxwMFJUd3BIUEl5TXpGN3RhSzhSaGRndFHSAYABQVVfeXFMT0pyYXhNNVdLeTM0em5KQkM1RUZkc0VMeU5sSWlXOGFPRzktdHd2eHYxSnJzc3prcDA0NjhoMld5dHBGNTlDN0Jpdmo4Q0FlSDJqZTBqQ1I4akFSSmxaZ19yTGJ4VUFoakZFMmxHbzVpWXhaQjczT204WHJ2VEZXSGg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Synthetic chemicals called phthalates, found in consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children’s toys, may have contributed to more than 10% of all global mortality from heart disease in 2018 among men and women ages 55 through 64, a new study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000e3b6mzf1pjf4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Phthalates contribute to inflammation and systemic inflammation in the coronary arteries, which can accelerate existing disease and lead to acute events including mortality,” said senior author Dr. Leonardo Trasande, a professor of pediatrics and population health at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. He also is director of NYU Langone’s Division of Environmental Pediatrics and Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000f3b6mautkc2qb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Phthalates are known to disrupt testosterone,” Trasande said, adding that in men, “low testosterone is a predictor of adult cardiovascular disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000g3b6m03ieospc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Phthalates have been linked in earlier studies with &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2478/s13382-011-0022-2" target="_blank"&gt;reproductive problems&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27567446/" target="_blank"&gt;genital malformations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1280383/" target="_blank"&gt;undescended testes &lt;/a&gt;in baby boys and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27546318/#:~:text=The%20general%20exposure%20to%20endocrine,malformations%20of%20the%20genital%20tract." target="_blank"&gt;lower sperm counts&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7067547/" target="_blank"&gt; testosterone levels &lt;/a&gt;in adult males. Studies have also linked phthalates to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1247566/" target="_blank"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3385443/" target="_blank"&gt;childhood obesity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273230099912965" target="_blank"&gt;cancer.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The new study underscores the potentially enormous health and economic burden of DEHP exposure, which aligns with existing concerns about its risks,” said David Andrews, acting chief science officer at the Environmental Working Group, a consumer organization that monitors exposure to phthalates and other chemicals in plastics, in an email. He was not involved with the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The American Chemistry Council, which represents industry, declined to comment on the study but told CNN via email that the organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.americanchemistry.com/industry-groups/high-phthalates" target="_blank"&gt;High Phthalates Panel&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to promoting the benefits of high phthalates such as DINP and DIDP.

    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000k3b6myh1jt81h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other common exposures come from the use of phthalates in food packaging, detergents, clothing, furniture and automotive plastics. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/phthalates-cosmetics" target="_blank"&gt;Phthalates&lt;/a&gt; are also added to personal care items such as shampoo, soap, hair spray and cosmetics to make fragrances last longer.&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/30/health/shopping-toxic-chemicals-wellness/index.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

            People are exposed when they breathe contaminated air or eat or drink foods that come into contact with the plastic, according to the &lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=377&amp;amp;toxid=65" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

            The new study, &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105730" target="_blank"&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal eBiomedicine, examined the impact of one phthalate — &lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=377&amp;amp;toxid=65" target="_blank"&gt;Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate&lt;/a&gt;, or DEHP — on global deaths across 200 countries and territories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000n3b6m610vnucu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers analyzed health and environmental data from dozens of population surveys, which included urine samples containing chemical breakdown products left by DEHP, which is known to be connected to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7570088/#:~:text=The%20authors%20found%20a%20positive,subclinical%20atherosclerosis%2C%20enhancing%20the%20risk" target="_blank"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, Trasande said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000o3b6mqoh2ib40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate has also been linked to birth defects, cancer and reproductive harm for men, according to California’s &lt;a href="https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/di2-ethylhexylphthalate-dehp" target="_blank"&gt;Proposition 65&lt;/a&gt;, a law that requires companies to place warning labels on products notifying consumers about chemicals’ possible health effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000p3b6mdnfg65k6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers compared the exposure with death statistics collected by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a US research group that gathers global medical information.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000q3b6mrvx58kr5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The analysis found exposure to DEHP contributed to 368,764 deaths in 2018 among men and women ages 55 through 64 globally. Africa accounted for 30% of the deaths from heart disease linked to DEHP, while East Asia and the Middle East accounted for 25% of the mortality, the study found.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000r3b6mm1bfdioa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research is believed to be the first global estimate of any health outcome from exposure to the DEHP, said lead study author Sara Hyman, an associate research scientist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000s3b6mv63u81ug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “By highlighting the connection between phthalates and a leading cause of death across the world, our findings add to the vast body of evidence that these chemicals present a tremendous danger to human health,” Hyman said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000t3b6mllcyynix@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A limitation of the research, however, stems from the use of hazard ratios the US to estimate population-attributable deaths in other countries, EWG’s Andrews said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000u3b6m0fj7a2zw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While the authors acknowledge this limitation, it assumes that the relationship between DEHP exposure and cardiovascular disease is consistent globally,” he said in an email. “This may not hold true given significant differences in both exposure levels and access to CVD detection and treatment across countries.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000v3b6mxpdd7sf0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/12/health/plastic-chemical-early-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; by Trasande and his team measured the urine concentration of phthalates in more than 5,000 adults in the United States and compared those levels with the risk of early death over an average of 10 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000w3b6mhoxmte59@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

            The results held even after researchers controlled for preexisting heart disease, diabetes, cancer and other common conditions, poor eating habits, physical activity and body mass, and levels of other known &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/17/health/bpa-bisphenol-a-plastics-canned-foods-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;hormone disruptors such as bisphenol A or BPA&lt;/a&gt;.

            Researchers estimated those deaths could cost the United States about $40 billion to $47 billion each year in lost economic productivity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            It is possible to minimize your exposure to phthalates and other endocrine disruptors, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc00103b6m15pm0pdc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Avoid plastics as much as you can. Reducing your use of ultraprocessed foods can reduce the levels of the chemical exposures you come in contact with,” Trasande said. “Never put plastic containers in the microwave or dishwasher, where the heat can break down the linings so they might be absorbed more readily.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc00113b6mev2owgaz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here are other tips to reduce exposure:

            ·       Avoid air fresheners and all plastics labeled as No. 3, No. 6 and No. 7.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The mass was likely hidden among dense breast tissue, since both appear white on the scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I asked to see her mammograms, and actually, her mammograms for the last five years read that she had extremely dense breasts, and she was never notified," Hallowell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/21/PDTN/83199236007-20250421-rbmecancerscreening-037.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=437&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/21/PDTN/83199236007-20250421-rbmecancerscreening-037.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=874&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Radiology vice chair Dr. David Pinkney, left, looks on as breast imaging division head Dr. Gurpriya Gupta talks about an MRI on the right and mammography on the left in the reading room at Henry Ford Radiology &amp;amp; Imaging in Detroit on April 21."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Radiology vice chair Dr. David Pinkney, left, looks on as breast imaging division head Dr. Gurpriya Gupta talks about an MRI on the right and mammography on the left in the reading room at Henry Ford Radiology &amp;amp; Imaging in Detroit on April 21." data-c-credit="Robin Buckson, The Detroit News"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/leo/bureaus-agencies/miosha/divisions/technical-services-division/rad-safety/mammography/breast-density-patient-notification-requirement" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Michigan law has required&lt;/a&gt; facilities to inform patients about breast density in a letter since 2015, the Food and Drug Administration updated its policies and made this the national standard last fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And yet, insurers in Michigan vary as far as who covers additional screenings for women with dense breast tissue. Blue Cross Blue Shield, Michigan's largest insurer with over 5 million members across all 50 states, covers 3D mammography or 2D mammography starting at age 40, as well as additional imaging for tactile abnormalities or abnormal mammograms, but is now reviewing its policies after the National Comprehensive Cancer Network released new guidance for patients with extremely dense breasts earlier this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"This guidance recommends patients with normal results from a mammogram receive a screening breast MRI with and without contrast beginning at age 50," Blue Cross Blue Shield said in a statement. "This new guidance is currently being reviewed by our medical policy team."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Michigan Medicaid, which provides coverage to low-income residents, also only covers mammograms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Thirty-six states have insurance laws on the books for coverage of 3D or supplemental screenings for breast cancer based on risk factors like breast density, according to &lt;a href="https://densebreast-info.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DBI-INSURANCE-TABLE032625.pdf" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dense Breast Info&lt;/a&gt;, an educational nonprofit based in New York, but Michigan is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Advocates say uneven coverage is a barrier for women with dense breasts, and many can't afford to pay out of pocket for additional screenings beyond a mammogram. There's also a lack of education about dense breast tissues among some patients, which is another obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The more information a patient has, the more they can advocate for themselves and make clear, informed decisions when it comes to health care," said Gretchen Awad, executive director of the Susan G. Komen breast cancer organization in northwest Ohio and Michigan. "But the letter of information about breast density is only really one step. The next step would be ... the equal and equitable mammogram policies in each state."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When physicians read mammograms, breast density falls within four categories: almost entirely fatty, scattered fibroglandular elements, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense, said Dr. Sabala Mandava, Chair of Radiology at Henry Ford Health. Heterogeneously dense tissue refers to tissue that is mostly dense but also has some areas of fatty tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When physicians talk about dense breast tissue, they are typically referring to the latter two categories, heterogeneously dense and extremely dense, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"If you have dense breast tissue ... it's one of the risk factors for breast cancer, so you will have an increased risk," Mandava said. "Because the tissue is dense, it's harder to see through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On a mammogram, dense tissue appears white and fat appears black, Mandava said. The issue is that cancers also appear white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"If you have more dense breast tissue, then it's harder to differentiate between a cancer and the tissue," Mandava said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/22/PDTN/83217584007-mammo-ultra.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=660&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/22/PDTN/83217584007-mammo-ultra.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=1320&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="These are side-by-side breast scans from a 69-year-old female patient with no symptoms and dense breasts.

Breast density refers to the amount of fibroglandular tissue, or the fibrous connective tissue and milk ducts and lobules, found in the breast, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/fibroglandular-breast-tissue" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;according to the National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"When you look at women who have the fatty tissue ... the pickup rate for cancer in those women is about 90%, but when you look at the women with dense tissue, the ability to find the cancer goes down to about 50%," said Dr. Murray Rebner, a Corewell Health diagnostic radiologist. "So that's a big difference, and that's why we recommend doing the extra testing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The federal Mammography Quality Standards Act was &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/mammography-quality-standards-act-mqsa-and-mqsa-program/important-information-final-rule-amend-mammography-quality-standards-act-mqsa" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;amended by the Food and Drug Administration on Sept. 10, 2024&lt;/a&gt;. Under the new standards, all facilities must send patients a letter classifying their breast density after administering a mammogram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If a patient's tissue is classified as dense, they must be informed that it can increase the risk of developing breast cancer, make it harder to find breast cancer on a mammogram, and that other imaging may help find cancer. The letter must also encourage the patient to talk to their provider, according to the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People with dense breasts should undergo extra screening, in addition to a mammogram, Rebner said. Doctors like to tailor imaging for patients based on their overall lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, which is based on several factors, including tissue density and genetic predisposition, Rebner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Supplemental screening can range from ultrasounds to molecular breast imaging with radioactive dye, and MRIs, Rebner said. Some techniques, like contrast-enhanced mammography, are still under investigation but may prove to be almost as good as MRIs at finding breast cancers, Rebner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/19/PDTN/83166650007-0418-kk-breast-cancer-screening-01.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=440&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/19/PDTN/83166650007-0418-kk-breast-cancer-screening-01.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=880&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Signage indicates the mammography, bone densitometry and breast ultrasound department of the Ascension St. John Hospital Health Center in St. Clair Shores, now part of Henry Ford Health."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Signage indicates the mammography, bone densitometry and breast ultrasound department of the Ascension St. John Hospital Health Center in St. Clair Shores, now part of Henry Ford Health." data-c-credit="Katy Kildee, The Detroit News"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"For high-risk women, women who, let's say, have a greater than 20% lifetime risk of getting breast cancer, those patients we typically recommend doing MRIs on," Rebner said. "MRI is really, right now, the best test at finding the most number of cancers for women who need an additional screening test."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Often, physicians will recommend that patients undergo a breast cancer risk assessment if they have dense breast tissue, Mandava said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"That will basically show if you are at high risk, and if you are, then there are supplemental tools," Mandava said. "You can get an MRI, you can do a whole breast ultrasound. There's a new modality coming out, or it has come out, but it's still new, called contrast-enhanced mammography."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Screening is currently the best tool available to fight breast cancer, Rebner said. Finding cancers earlier also allows physicians to treat them more efficiently, potentially avoiding chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or extensive surgeries, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The purpose of screening is to find breast cancer at its earliest point of development," Rebner said. "By finding cancers earlier on ... if you do that, you reduce mortality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Additional screenings, out of pocket&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Michigan is one of 14 states that have no insurance law for coverage of 3D or supplemental screening for breast cancer, according to Dense Breast Info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Advocates such as Awad applaud the recent FDA mammography notification changes but say it's only the first step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Awad, who lives in Ohio, said she was informed that she has dense breast tissue, and she pays an additional out-of-pocket fee for a more advanced mammogram. Not everyone is able to access additional screening methods, can afford out-of-pocket costs if their insurance doesn't cover it, or is aware of what their screening options beyond regular mammograms are, she said. Coverage varies by both state and insurance provider, Awad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It's very important to not forget that everyone's accessibility to health care is different," Awad said. "While I might live or you might live in an area with high-quality and highly trained technicians ... not everyone does."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/19/PDTN/83166653007-0418-kk-breast-cancer-screening-02.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=440&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/19/PDTN/83166653007-0418-kk-breast-cancer-screening-02.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=880&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Information is posted on a corkboard inside the mammography, bone densitometry and breast ultrasound department of the Ascension St. John Hospital Health Center, now part of Henry Ford Health."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Information is posted on a corkboard inside the mammography, bone densitometry and breast ultrasound department of the Ascension St. John Hospital Health Center, now part of Henry Ford Health." data-c-credit="Katy Kildee, The Detroit News"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Coverage varies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In Michigan, coverage varies for additional screenings, which can range from $250 to $1,000 out of pocket for a breast MRI to $250 to $400 for a breast ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Priority Health said they cover 3D mammography as a preventive measure, and have done so since Michigan's Breast Density Notification law passed in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"MRIs or whole-breast ultrasounds are used as part of diagnostic measures and may include member cost sharing," Priority Health said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, which covers digital breast 3D mammography or 2D mammography starting at age 40, said its medical policies are also reviewed annually, or when significant evidence is released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Michigan's Medicaid program, for low-income residents and some with disabilities, covers mammograms for screening purposes in accordance with guidelines from the American Cancer Society and United States Preventive Services Task Force, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Lynn Sutfin said. But she said there "is not enough evidence for the Task Force to recommend for or against additional screening with breast ultrasound or MRI."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Women are generally told that they have dense breasts after they’ve had a mammogram. These women deserve to know whether and how additional screening might help them stay healthy," the &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/breast-cancer-screening#:~:text=Frequently%20Asked%20Questions,of%20dying%20from%20this%20disease." data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;task force's recommendation&lt;/a&gt;, which was published last April, said. "... We are urgently calling for more research on whether and how additional screening might help women with dense breasts find cancers earlier."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sutfin also said that Michigan Medicaid has a process to support coverage of diagnostic mammograms at different intervals, ages, or frequencies when needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Aetna said its coverage of supplemental breast imaging for both medical and preventive care complies with federal and state regulations, as well as plan-specific benefits, spokesman Phillip Brando wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Health Alliance Plan and Meridian did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;A nonprofit is born&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hallowell, moved to act by her sister's diagnosis, founded a nonprofit called &lt;a href="https://www.operationbreastdensity.org/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Operation Breast Density&lt;/a&gt; to educate people about what breast density is, how people can determine their breast density, and how to talk to their physician about it. The nonprofit also hosts an annual symposium to educate clinicians and raise funds to help people pay for supplemental imaging when their insurance doesn't cover it, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Seeing someone that knew how to advocate for ... themselves and knew what should be done, and still they weren't given correct service, I decided to start the nonprofit to educate women," Hallowell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People with a diagnosis of breast density from a mammogram within the last two years, and a prescription for supplemental imaging from their physician, can reach out to the nonprofit for financial assistance, Hallowell said.

Instead, he follows a total plant-based diet, which includes milk and eggs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Scharffenberg's favourite foods include mangoes, persimmons, potatoes, macadamias and other nuts and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says a vegetarian diet is 'optimum' because eating too much meat can &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/eating-red-meat-daily-triples-heart-disease-related-chemical#:~:text=High%20saturated%20fat%20levels%20in,affect%20heart%20disease%20is%20complex."&gt;increase the risk &lt;/a&gt;of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nutrition professor Dr Scharffenberg follows a total plant-based diet, which includes milk and eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Rule #6 - Get saturated fat intake down by cutting meat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This rule ties back into Dr Scharffenberg's edict about the benefits of adopting a vegetarian diet, because loads of saturated fats come from meat like beef, pork and poultry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Accordingly, Dr Scharffenberg says adhering to a vegetarian diet and getting rid of animal fat intake is the simplest way to avoid the &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/eating-red-meat-daily-triples-heart-disease-related-chemical#:~:text=High%20saturated%20fat%20levels%20in,affect%20heart%20disease%20is%20complex."&gt;risks&lt;/a&gt; associated with high saturated fat intake, like high blood pressure and high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Rule #7 - Say 'no' to your sweet tooth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Scharffenberg points to a clear link between sugar consumption and the &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/eating-too-much-added-sugar-increases-the-risk-of-dying-with-heart-disease-201402067021"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of heart disease as well as other weight gain related health issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He recommends modifying recipes to reduce sugar intake.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians say proper hydration is critical for healthy blood sugar. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with diabetes may be prone to dehydration, so fluids are especially important.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-sugar fruits, veggies and Greek yogurt are fluid-rich and diabetes-friendly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Staying hydrated and managing blood sugar are two essential pillars of overall health. And they’re particularly important if you’re living with type 2 diabetes—for several reasons. The first is that high blood sugar levels may lead to increased urination, which may cause dehydration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Proper hydration is also crucial for supporting kidney function. Since the kidneys play a vital role in filtering excess sugar from the blood, dehydration can put additional strain on these organs if you have diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that there are certain water-rich foods that can be a delicious part of a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7886108/diabetes-meal-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diabetes-friendly diet&lt;/a&gt; and provide the fluids you need. To find out which ones are best, we reached out to registered dietitians. Here are their top hydrating foods for healthy blood sugar.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Boasting roughly 95% water, cucumbers can help keep you refreshed and hydrated without having to rely on sugary or caloric drinks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  With just 4 grams of carbohydrates per cup, they’re also a blood sugar–friendly food. Their skin also provides a bit of fiber, which can prevent rapid glucose spikes, says Orlando-based registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannahkatz/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Johannah Katz, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Okra might not be on your radar, but it should be! Not only is okra 93% water, it provides 4 grams of blood sugar–stabilizing fiber per cup.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Okra contains a gel-like soluble fiber, which slows down sugar absorption,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anosiri/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Adaure Nosiri, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, an Atlanta-based registered dietitian. “Okra also contains antioxidants like flavonoids and polyphenols, which play a role in reducing inflammation and improving glucose metabolism.” One cooked cup of this veggie contains 7 grams of carbs, making it easy to fit into a balanced meal plan. Plus, it supplies &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, a mineral that plays a pivotal role in blood sugar regulation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try it roasted, steamed or in soups for a versatile, hydrating addition to your diet. If you’ve never made okra before, give our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252686/black-eyed-peas-okra/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Black Eyed Peas &amp;amp; Okra&lt;/a&gt; a go. This diabetes-friendly side packs 7 grams of fiber per serving plus 11% of the Daily Value for magnesium.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 Medium Apple = 5.2 Ounces H20&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Apples are made up of about 85% water and are high in fiber, with about 4 grams in a medium apple,” says &lt;a href="https://www.healthprofs.com/us/nutritionists-dietitians/stephanie-deming-churchville-ny/1390520" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Stephanie Deming, M.S., RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and owner of Bespoke Family Nutrition, PLLC.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re worried about their sugar, there’s no need to be. Apples’ rich fiber slows the absorption of their sugars for a steady, prolonged energy release. Just make sure to eat the skins. They contain special fibers like pectin and cellulose that may help manage blood sugar.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Apples are so beneficial that one small study found that people with impaired blood sugar control who ate an apple before a high-carb meal experienced fewer blood sugar spikes than when they ate only simple carbs from rice.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, bite into a crunchy apple when you need a satisfying snack (pair it with nut butter to add some healthy fats and protein for satiety support!). Or, for a hearty dinner, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252584/apple-cider-chicken/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Apple Cider Chicken&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This juicy citrus fruit is composed of 90% water, making it an excellent way to quench your thirst while adding a burst of refreshing flavor to your day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Not only do grapefruits have a high water content, but they also provide your body with an important electrolyte, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069581/what-does-potassium-do/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, which helps with overall fluid balance,” says &lt;a href="http://www.wellnourishedmamas.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Jamie Adams, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian specializing in women’s health. Additionally, grapefruit’s fiber slows the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream, promoting steadier energy levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether enjoyed as a snack, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8023984/grapefruit-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;in a zesty salad&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269497/pineapple-grapefruit-detox-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;added to a smoothie&lt;/a&gt;, this fruit is a delicious, nutritious addition to any diet.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 Cup Diced Watermelon = 4.6 Ounces H2O&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As its name suggests, watermelon is an incredibly hydrating food (it’s 91% water!).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That makes it an ideal choice for staying hydrated on hot days while enjoying a naturally sweet treat. And despite what you might have heard, it has only 9 grams of sugar per cup. So, it can easily fit into a blood sugar management plan. Plus, watermelon contains citrulline, an amino acid that supports the production of nitric oxide, a compound that promotes better blood flow. While more research is needed, emerging research suggests citrulline may also improve insulin resistance and help manage blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, watermelon is juicy and refreshing on its own. For even more blood sugar–lowering power, pair it with a small serving of nuts or cheese to balance its carbohydrates. Or try our low-carb &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/272847/watermelon-cucumber-feta-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Watermelon, Cucumber &amp;amp; Feta Salad&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1 (5.6-Ounce) Container Nonfat Plain Greek Yogurt = 4.4 Ounces H2O&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Plain unsweetened Greek yogurt is a high-moisture food, and not only offers a quality source of protein, but is also low in carbohydrate and sugar,” says &lt;a href="https://www.milkandhoneynutrition.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mary Ellen Phipps, M.P.H., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and author of &lt;em&gt;The Easy Diabetes Cookbook&lt;/em&gt;. “That makes it a perfect combination for people who have to pay attention to their blood sugars.” While a single-serve container of plain Greek yogurt only has about 6 grams of carbohydrates, flavored yogurt can have lots of added sugars. If plain yogurt isn’t your thing, look for no-sugar-added varieties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Greek yogurt is roughly 80% water. That’s not all, though. A 5.6-ounce container provides about 16 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s an added bonus, as protein slows digestion for steady blood sugar levels. Because protein also helps keep you full, it can help with weight loss if that’s part of your diabetes management plan. And if you need one more reason to toss a container in your shopping cart, Greek yogurt offers probiotics, promoting gut health, which is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gut-health-and-diabetes-8584301" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increasingly linked to better blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a refreshing, hydrating snack, top plain Greek yogurt with a handful of fresh berries or a sprinkle of cinnamon.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Staying hydrated and keeping your blood sugar steady are two key steps to feeling your best, especially if you’re living with type 2 diabetes. The good news? You can tackle both at once by adding delicious, nutrient-packed, hydrating foods to your meals. Think crisp cucumbers, tender okra, juicy apples, tangy grapefruit, refreshing watermelon and creamy plain Greek yogurt. These powerhouse foods will quench your thirst and help keep your blood sugar in check. Now that’s a win-win!&lt;br&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — As the weather warms and people start cleaning, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services issued a warning about hantavirus — a disease passed through droppings, urine and saliva of mice or other rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stirring up dust where rodents have been can cause hantavirus to get into the air where the particles can be breathed in," the department said Monday in a prepared release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It urges Utahns to be cautious when cleaning out sheds, cabins or other buildings that have had rodents present. The health department said hantavirus is rare; there are typically one or two reported cases in Utah each year, but it is fatal in about 60% of reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of hantavirus include fatigue, fever and muscle aches and can include headaches, dizziness, chills or stomach issues. A second phase of the disease brings coughing and shortness of breath due to liquid in the lungs, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kacy Nowak, an epidemiologist with the health department, said anyone who comes into contact with rodents that carry the virus is at risk for contracting hantavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Make sure you take precautions when you work in areas with potential rodent droppings and nests. Use a disinfectant spray on areas with droppings and wait 15-20 minutes before you clean. This will kill the virus and decrease your risk," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/prevention/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;other steps&lt;/a&gt; people can take to prevent contracting hantavirus include airing out closed buildings before going in, not sweeping droppings up, trapping mice, keeping pet food covered to not attract mice, sealing holes in homes and removing piles of trash, wood or junk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cleaning up after rodents, the health department encouraged wearing rubber or plastic gloves and washing hands afterwards; soaking urine, droppings and nests with bleach or disinfectant before cleaning; throwing away towels used to clean up in a covered can; and cleaning the area with a disinfectant again after removing the nest or droppings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Mexico authorities say actor Gene Hackman's wife, Betsy Arakawa, likely died Feb. 11 at their Santa Fe home from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Her autopsy report hasn't yet been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Associated Press story published Monday said the leading cause of Hackman's death was heart disease. He was also in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease and likely had not eaten for a long time, according to a new autopsy report. He appeared to have outlived Arakawa at home by about a week, possibly unaware of his wife's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, Texas — As health officials begin &lt;a href="/article/news/health/austin-measles-exposure-warning-contact-tracing/269-1142c886-b99c-47e6-8adf-973a14542a0a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;contact tracing a second measles case in Travis County&lt;/a&gt;, some businesses are taking extra precautions to deal with the exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austin Public Health identified nine locations across Austin where the infected person visited, including the South Austin Mexican restaurant, Curra's, which has been around for decades.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Julieta Rodriguez, the owner of Curra's, said she learned about the exposure at her establishment through news reports and had not heard from health officials.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My first thought was, it’s going to kill business,” Rodriguez said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately, Rodriguez said she hired a cleaning company to disinfect the restaurant over the weekend and has spoken to customers and staff since the case was reported.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Every day we clean," Rodriguez said. "We follow protocol with health codes, so that's pretty much what we can do as far as right now."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez added that she and her staff are vaccinated and have not felt any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I can tell my customers is not to feel worried," Rodriguez said. “We're doing what we’re supposed to do."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health officials stressed there is still a risk of exposure despite the person who was infected being fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that a person who has been vaccinated is going to have less viral load,” said Dr. Desmar Walkes, the medical director and health authority for Austin Public Health. "While the patient did catch the virus, they only have mild symptoms and are able to rest at home."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walkes also shared what health officials are doing in terms of outreach after Rodriguez said she wasn't aware of the exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been calling those businesses, and we'll continue to do so to work with them to provide the information they need,” Walkes said. "It may have been that they hadn't received that call as of yet.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walkes, along with Austin Mayor Kirk Watson and Travis County Judge Andy Brown, reiterated the importance of getting the MMR vaccine as they ensure it is the best protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The key message today is that while we've had this second case of measles ... the best defense is vaccination,” Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for people who are unsure of their immunity status against the virus, they can speak with their health provider and take a test. For many who may be wondering whether they need a booster, Walkes said the two required doses should be sufficient unless one’s immune system is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

The above image shows hazmat-suited workers at a quarantine zone after an outbreak of bird flu in Victoria, Australia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A fellow GVN director and expert on animal viruses, Dr Ab Osterhaus, says that a potential vaccine could also help to solve the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Given the growing circulation of H5N1 among mammals, the GVN calls for urgent efforts to understand and interrupt transmission in cattle through herd management and potential vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Strengthening surveillance at animal-human interfaces is crucial, as current monitoring efforts are insufficient to guide effective prevention strategies.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Biden Administration awarded Moderna a $590 million contract to develop a vaccine for H5N1 bird flu vaccine but there were reports earlier this year that the new administration could pull that funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response (OPPR), created after COVID-19 to coordinate rapid responses to outbreaks, has been left virtually unstaffed and unfunded since the Trump Administration came in, according to reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pandemic planning has also been moved inside the National Security Council, which critics fear limits transparency and public oversight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first US &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/bird-flu/index.html" id="mol-df4a7cb0-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; death was reported in January, with a person in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/louisiana/index.html" id="mol-df550400-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2" class=""&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; passing away after being hospitalized with severe respiratory symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials said the person was older than 65, had underlying medical problems and had been in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No other details were revealed. They also said a genetic analysis of the patient's infection suggested the bird &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-df4c9f90-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2" class=""&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; virus had mutated while inside their body, which could have caused a more severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since March 2024, 70 confirmed bird flu infections have been reported in the US, but most illnesses have been mild and most have been detected among farmworkers directly exposed to sick poultry or dairy cows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In two cases - an adult in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/missouri/index.html" id="mol-df555220-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and a child in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-df53cb80-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; - health officials have not determined how they contracted the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many experts put H5N1 at the top of their lists of pandemic threats, due to how widespread it is among animals and how rapidly it appears to be mutating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its growing presence in the environment increases the chances people will be exposed, and potentially catch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marc Johnson, a virologist at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/missouri/index.html" id="mol-81777ee0-246e-11f0-b9de-a9e256473e2a" class=""&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, recently said on X: 'This virus might not go pandemic, but it is really trying hard, and it sure is getting a lot of opportunities.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Leading health experts are warning that the US could be on the brink of another pandemic, with bird flu now present in all 50 states and millions of poultry culled every week as a result&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The GVN is now calling on world governments to address the threat of H5N1 avian influenza by improving surveillance and implementing biosecurity measures &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, figures show since the virus was detected in the US in January 2022, more than 12,875 wild and domestic flocks have been infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After&lt;span&gt; the virus spread to cows this year, it was diagnosed in 1,031 herds across 17 states - with the majority in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-d808d6d0-be4a-11ef-b15c-3b2cf3c0c1bd"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/colorado/index.html" id="mol-d80924f0-be4a-11ef-b15c-3b2cf3c0c1bd"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And 70 cases have now been detected in humans across 14 states this year, the most cases reported in the US in at least two decades. Before the current outbreak, the last human case of bird flu was in 1997.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no evidence any of the patients spread the disease to other patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the virus has been detected in unpasteurized or 'raw' milks, leading the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to announce that all companies handling raw milk will be &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14166987/trendy-milk-tested-bird-flu-threat.html"&gt;required to share samples&lt;/a&gt; for testing upon request. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many experts, including officials at the World Health Organization, have criticized the US' response to the outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts have described it as a pandemic 'unfolding in slow motion.' Until the end of 2024, nearly all testing of cattle and of people exposed to infected cows were voluntary. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even now, mandatory testing is limited only to cattle moving between state lines.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cases have also been sporadically recorded in pigs, which has concerned researchers because these animals can catch both human and bird strains of flu - and could be 'mixing vessels' for a new strain of bird flu virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This map shows cases of the virus detected in wild mammals, such as red foxes and seals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And infections have been recorded among more than 400 non-bird wild animals in the US since May 2022, including red foxes, skunks, seals and raccoons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts warned these animals may pick up the virus after eating from carcasses of birds that had died from the bird flu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wastewater surveillance for the virus has also picked up traces in 60 of the more than 250 sites monitored across the US. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In California and Iowa, more than 80 percent of samples have tested positive. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US already has a stockpile of about 20million bird &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-b24635c0-bef7-11ef-b93e-fd05780f214b"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; vaccines in its national stockpile, officials say, which are 'well matched' to the H5N1 virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also has the capacity to quickly make 100million more if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are also supplies of antivirals such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) - which used to treat the latest US bird flu patient in Louisiana - available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still ongoing, is work to develop a bird flu vaccine for poultry and tests showing that human antivirals would work just as well on sick cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Press release from the Humboldt-Del Norte Veterinary Medical Association&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Humboldt-Del Norte Veterinary Medical Association is sponsoring a county-wide low-cost
canine rabies vaccination clinic. The Humboldt-Del Norte Veterinary Medical Association offers
these low-cost canine rabies clinics as a public service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important that all dogs and cats be
vaccinated, as we have had several cases of rabies in wildlife and pets in Humboldt County as
recently as the last few months. Foxes, skunks, and bats are a few examples of rabies carriers.
We will be vaccinating dogs at the cost of $10.00 per rabies vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of several conditions, and it’s diagnosed in people who exhibit three of five conditions, including high waist circumference, low HDL (beneficial) cholesterol, high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood triglycerides.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The prevalence of metabolic syndrome tends to increase as we get older. One study cites the rate at nearly 20% for those 20 to 39 years old but nearly 50% of those aged 60 and over.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Metabolic syndrome increases your risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes—it also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increases your risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we often think of dementia and metabolic syndrome as being diseases of “old age,” there is evidence that these conditions may be on the increase in younger people. This connection and prevalence is an area researchers in Korea wanted to hone in on and learn more about. The research team published their findings in the American Academy of Neurology’s journal &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The goal of this study was to investigate the association between metabolic syndrome in midlife (ages 40 to 60) and the incidence of young-onset dementia. Young-onset dementia, also called early-onset dementia, is dementia diagnosed before age 65. The researchers also examined which components of metabolic syndrome are most strongly associated with an increased risk of young-onset dementia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew their data from the Korean National Insurance Service, a government-run health insurance system in South Korea that covers more than 99% of its population. The services include regular biennial health checkups that gather clinical and lifestyle data, income levels and medical diagnoses. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After initially extracting data for more than 4 million people, researchers ultimately included around 2 million participants between the ages of 40 and 60 for this study who had undergone a general health screening in 2009. Participants were followed for an average of eight years. Just over half of the participants were men.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of the participants, just over 25% met the criteria for metabolic syndrome. This included having at least three of the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Elevated waist circumference: ≥90 cm in men, ≥80 cm in women&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure: systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥85 mm Hg; or use of medication for high blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood sugar levels: elevated fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL or use of oral medication for high blood sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood triglycerides: ≥150 mg/dL or use of medication for high triglycerides&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low HDL (beneficial) cholesterol: &amp;lt;40 mg/dL in men, &amp;lt;50 mg/dL in women; or use of medication for low HDL-C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; About 60% of the metabolic syndrome group were participants in their 50s, and 40% in their 40s. Men made up over 62% of this group. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers gathered demographic and lifestyle data that were adjusted for during statistical analyses. These included age, BMI, smoking status, alcohol consumption, regular exercise and income level. In addition, they also gathered medical diagnoses of the participants that occurred during the study period, focusing on dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After running several statistical analyses, results suggested that metabolic syndrome in people ages 40 to 60 was associated with a:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;24% higher risk of all-cause young-onset dementia—all-cause meaning all types of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12% increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;21% increased risk of vascular dementia—a type of dementia caused by damage to the brain’s blood vessels, thus reducing blood flow and oxygen to the brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also broke findings down for men and women. They found that men with metabolic syndrome had a 15% higher risk of young-onset dementia, and women with metabolic syndrome had a 34% higher risk of young-onset dementia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, being diagnosed with metabolic syndrome in the 40s increased the risk of young-onset dementia more than being diagnosed in the 50s. And while all the components (risk factors) of metabolic syndrome were associated with an increased risk of young-onset dementia, the risk progressively increased with the number of components present.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers pointed out several limitations of their study. First, they cannot say whether their results extend to people outside of South Korea. They also did not include other variables that influence young-onset dementia risk, like the presence of certain genes, family history of YOD, history of traumatic brain injury, hearing loss and education level. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers note that they also lacked detailed behavioral (i.e. mental health) and environmental data, which can also influence dementia risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dementia is more than just forgetting someone’s name or where you put your keys. It interferes with one’s ability to think, remember, understand, communicate and reason.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Over time, it diminishes physical abilities, too, as the brain forgets how to do simple activities that used to be second nature. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While influenced by genetics, the components of metabolic syndrome may be a result of lifestyle choices. And they’re the same lifestyle choices that also influence your risk of other diseases, including heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and dementia. And many of these diseases and conditions are linked. For example, type 2 diabetes has been &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/link-between-dementia-and-type-2-diabetes-11704056" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;associated with an increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of dementia. And healthy cholesterol levels reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cholesterol-dementia-risk-study-11709528" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;as well as dementia&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Considering how all of these conditions are intertwined, it makes sense that there might be a common denominator. Scientists believe one of them is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, which can have several causes, including chronic stress, poor sleep quality, poor diet quality, microbiome imbalances and lack of physical activity. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That means certain lifestyle changes can help on that front, too.With that said, nothing is perfect, and no one habit—or combination of habits—will guarantee you will be free of inflammation or disease. But evidence does lean toward people with healthier habits being at lower risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not sure where to begin? What habit are you most likely to see the quickest success in? For example, do you enjoy a walk or a trip to the gym occasionally? Maybe start there, gradually building a regular habit. Or if you’ve been wanting to branch out and try some new recipes, now could be a good time to add some tasty, healthy options to your arsenal.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, this study suggests that individuals diagnosed with metabolic syndrome in midlife have a higher likelihood of developing young-onset dementia compared with those without metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle choices and habits play a huge role in disease risk. Start today by doing one beneficial thing for your health and then repeat it each day. Over time, small changes can become big improvements.&lt;br&gt;

HSV-1 is the kind that causes cold sores, while HSV-2 typically causes genital symptoms. There is no cure for either virus and both remain in the body, dormant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have to carry this virus for life; there is no medication available to treat it,' the woman lamented. 'There is only medication to relieve the pain, but the symptoms are recurring.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eight years on, the amateur singer says she is still dealing with a range of uncomfortable symptoms associated with herpes, and the cold sores even &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14490535/Toddler-losing-eye-kissed-cold-sore-herpes-blind.html"&gt;made their way onto her cheeks earlier this year. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts from Li.Lac, a tech company which makes a disinfecting device for microphones, warns that 'contaminated microphones can spread harmful bacteria or viruses, like the flu or other diseases'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It adds: 'This is particularly concerning in settings where multiple people may be using the same microphone, such as in recording studios, theaters, and conference rooms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One woman claims that she got more than she bargained for after a trip to her local karaoke bar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In addition, microphones can harbor allergens and irritants that can trigger respiratory issues for those who are sensitive.'&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14490535/Toddler-losing-eye-kissed-cold-sore-herpes-blind.html"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, &lt;span&gt;HSV-1 - the virus which typically causes oral herpes - is quite fragile outside the body, and once saliva dries, the virus typically becomes inactive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highest risk would be if you were to immediately use a mic that someone with an active cold sore had come into contact with and you have broken skin on your mouth that the virus could enter through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A report this year revealed that more than 846million adults worldwide are currently living with genital herpes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genital herpes is an exceedingly common and life-long sexually transmitted disease spread by two types of the herpes simplex virus (HSV).&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both types one and two can cause genital herpes. Type one typically manifests as cold sores, while HSV-2 is generally associated with sexual transmission and genital herpes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An international team of researchers sought to improve upon earlier methods to estimate the prevalence of both types of HSV worldwide in people under 50, starting with the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/world-health-organization/index.html" id="mol-bdcdbc80-b748-11ef-a27d-27fa2c0d4e7e" class=""&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;'s 2012 and 2016 estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers determined that the global prevalence of incurable genital herpes has been on the decline in recent years. Around 1 in 5 people under 50, or 846 million globally, are living with genital herpes, according to the latest estimates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Both herpes simplex virus types one and two can cause genital herpes. Type one, which can occur at a young age, typically causes oral herpes (manifested as cold sores), while HSV-2 is generally associated with sexual transmission and genital herpes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More broadly, the research team determined that two-thirds of the global population – around 3.8 billion people – were living with any form of the more common HSV-1 in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2020 alone, there were 122 million new HSV-1 infections in people from birth to 49 years old, including 16.8 million new genital infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And among people 15 to 39 affected by sexually-transmitted HSV-2, researchers identified 26 million new infections in 2020, bringing the total number of people currently living with HSV-2 to 520 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 20million Americans &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-9189567/One-five-Americans-STI-nearly-HALF-infections-people-age-24.html"&gt;test positive for sexually transmitted infections every year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 50 and 80 percent of Americans &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-5364293/Half-Americans-cold-sores-12-genital-herpes.html"&gt;get the occasional cold sore, while about 12 percent of Americans 14 to 49 years old have genital herpes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genital herpes causes painful blisters and open sores at times on the vagina, penis, labia, or testicles, but it can also be asymptomatic. Additionally, the herpes simplex family of viruses can lay dormant in the body without causing noticeable problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the virus infects a person, it may travel up to a cluster of sensory nerves in the brain and remain dormant there for months or even years after the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in times of stress, severe fatigue, or changes to the immune system, the virus can reactivate, multiply, and travel back to the skin through nerve fibers. These stressful times can result in new blisters in the same area as the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People diagnosed with genital herpes are treated with prescription antiviral medications to make outbreaks shorter and less painful, but there is no cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 21:02:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>无创脑脊髓界面可能有助于受伤后恢复运动-神经科学新闻 | Noninvasive Brain-Spine Interface May Help Restore Movement After Injury - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE5ISHFvZ1FmRkZaZFZHSDJkOTBpRDNYRzEwU0hVMDlIRWh5eUFzekw5TWlwRmJhSXdCSkdJUTE0SFFUQ0k3R29hVWw2R0JXYTdoaEdCWXRFUVNNQWtsRUswdGV3OXdqNUFXQ1o2U3h3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have developed a noninvasive brain-spine interface that detects movement intentions and cues spinal cord stimulation to aid rehabilitation. Using EEG caps, they trained a decoder to recognize when volunteers either moved or imagined moving their legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This proof-of-concept study shows that imagined movement alone can reliably trigger spinal stimulation, opening new possibilities for restoring voluntary movement after spinal cord injury. Future efforts aim to create universal decoders to simplify clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movement Intention Decoded:&lt;/strong&gt; A noninvasive EEG decoder accurately predicts leg movement or imagined movement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spinal Stimulation Triggered:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain signals can cue spinal cord stimulation to reinforce voluntary movement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; This approach may lead to noninvasive rehabilitation therapies for people with spinal cord injuries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a person sustains an injury to the spinal cord, the normal communication between the brain and the spinal circuits below the injury are interrupted, resulting in paralysis. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the brain is functioning normally, as is the spinal cord below the injury, researchers have been working to re-establish the communication to allow for rehabilitation and potentially restore movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ismael Seáñez, assistant professor of biomedical engineering in the McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis and of neurosurgery at WashU Medicine, and members of his lab, including Carolyn Atkinson, a doctoral student, have developed a type of decoder to restore that communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through experiments in their lab with 17 human subjects without a spinal cord injury, they were able to cue movement in the lower leg with transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, or noninvasive, external electrical pulses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results of the research were published online April 25, 2025, in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a special cap fitted with noninvasive electrodes that measure brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While wearing the cap, seated volunteers were asked to extend their leg at the knee, then to only think about extending their leg – while keeping it still — so researchers could record the brain waves in both exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team provided the neural activity to the decoder, or algorithm, so it could learn how the brain waves act in both circumstances. They found that the actual movement and imagined movement used similar neural strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After we give the decoder this data, it learns to predict based on neural activity whenever there is movement or no movement,” Seáñez said. “We show that we can predict whenever someone is thinking about moving their leg, even if their leg does not actually move.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used controls to ensure that the volunteers were truly imagining movement and not actually moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whenever people move, this can introduce signal noise, and we want to make sure that the signal noise is not what we’re learning to predict,” Seáñez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s movement intention or brain activity that we want to predict, so we have people imagine that they’re extending their leg and use the same algorithm that has been trained on people moving to predict whether they were imagining or not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seáñez said this reveals two things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One, that it’s more likely that we’re decoding movement intention and not an artifact, or noise, and second, whenever we employ this on people with spinal cord injury who will not have that ability to actually move their legs for us to label the data, we could use their imagination of moving a leg to train our decoder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seáñez said the proof-of-concept study is a first step toward developing a noninvasive brain-spine interface that uses real-time predictions to deliver transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation to reinforce voluntary movement in a single joint in rehabilitation in patients with a spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the team plans to test a generalized decoder trained on data from all participants that could determine whether a universal decoder could perform as well as a personalized one and simplify its use in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding for this research was provided by the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University in St. Louis; the National Institutes of Health (K12-HD073945, K01-NS127936; R01-EB026439; P41-EB018783); the Department of Biomedical Engineering in McKelvey Engineering at WashU; and the Department of Neurosurgery at WashU Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this SCI and neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f29e819a9394949780b2858781869edc979687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leah Shaffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wustl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WUSTL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Leah Shaffer – WUSTL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://jneuroengrehab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12984-025-01628-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Development and evaluation of a non-invasive brain-spine interface using transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation&lt;/a&gt;” by Carolyn Atkinson et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development and evaluation of a non-invasive brain-spine interface using transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motor rehabilitation is a therapeutic process to facilitate functional recovery in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). However, its efficacy is limited to areas with remaining sensorimotor function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) creates a temporary prosthetic effect that may allow further rehabilitation-induced recovery in individuals without remaining sensorimotor function, thereby extending the therapeutic reach of motor rehabilitation to individuals with more severe injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this work, we report our first steps in developing a non-invasive brain-spine interface (BSI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) and transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to identify EEG-based neural correlates of lower limb movement in the sensorimotor cortex of unimpaired individuals (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 17) and to quantify the performance of a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) decoder in detecting movement onset from these neural correlates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that initiation of knee extension was associated with event-related desynchronization in the central-medial cortical regions at frequency bands between 4 and 44 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our neural decoder using µ (8–12 Hz), low β (16–20 Hz), and high β (24–28 Hz) frequency bands achieved an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 ± 0.06 s.d. (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 7) during a cued movement task offline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalization to imagery and uncued movement tasks served as positive controls to verify robustness against movement artifacts and cue-related confounds, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the addition of real-time decoder-modulated tSCS, the neural decoder performed with an average AUC of 0.81 ± 0.05 s.d. (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 9) on cued movement and 0.68 ± 0.12 s.d. (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 9) on uncued movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that the decrease in decoder performance in uncued movement may be due to differences in underlying cortical strategies between conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we explore alternative applications of the BSI system by testing neural decoders trained on uncued movement and imagery tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By developing a non-invasive BSI, tSCS can be timed to be delivered only during voluntary effort, which may have implications for improving rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 21:00:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5ISHFvZ1FmRkZaZFZHSDJkOTBpRDNYRzEwU0hVMDlIRWh5eUFzekw5TWlwRmJhSXdCSkdJUTE0SFFUQ0k3R29hVWw2R0JXYTdoaEdCWXRFUVNNQWtsRUswdGV3OXdqNUFXQ1o2U3h3</guid></item><item><title>欧洲和美洲的麻疹病例飙升- CIDRAP | Measles cases in Europe, the Americas skyrocket - CIDRAP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBOWVNJX3hCRTlzWHNuTlFnZWJidV9VcHgtOVBrUGxOZlpNWTBHbHNKR3dNLW81RExxQmpyU2tuS0l3X0ktWjdPMno1ekZLYmJ2TGxYRmw5NjJVTTgyLUFoYkRybEZlYU42eXhCcVVJMDJoTHllTmhPWVdBcWtwSUk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles cases across Europe were up 10-fold in 2024 compared to 2023, while cases in the Americas so far this year are 11-fold higher, according to updates today from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/measles-annual-epidemiological-report-2024"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Moreover, the ECDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said the 2024 measles cases in the European region followed a seasonal pattern, which was not noted in 2021 through 2023. In 2024, a total of 35,212 measles cases were reported across the European region, compared to 3,973 in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reports come as US states continue to confirm more infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romania has by far the most cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 87% of the European cases were reported in Romania, which had the highest notification rate, at 1,610.7 cases per 1,000,000 population, followed by Austria (59.5), Belgium (44.9) and Ireland (39.6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-three measles-related deaths were confirmed in 2024, of which 22 were in Romania, and 14 of the 23 were in children aged 5 years or younger. Children under the age of 1 year represented 13% of measles cases, and children 1 to 4 years represented 33.1% of cases. Among the 90% of case-patients with known vaccine status, 87% were unvaccinated, and 98% of infected babies (younger than 1 year) and 90% of children 1 and 4 years old with measles were unvaccinated.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECDC said dropping vaccine rates are contributing to the post-pandemic spike in measles activity across the county: In 2024, only three countries, Hungary, Malta, Portugal, had had coverage of 95% or more for both doses of the measles vaccine.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cases last year in the European region were reported in February through July, with a decline in the second half of the year. 'The marked resurgence in 2024 emphasizes a return to more typical measles seasonal patterns, but at significantly elevated levels compared to the pandemic and pre-pandemic years," the ECDC said.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cases climb 11-fold in Americas&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today the WHO warned that, compared with late April of last year, measles cases have increased 11-fold in the Americas, with six countries reporting 2,318 measles cases, including 3 deaths—all in the United States—so far this year. From January 1 tto April 18, 2024, only 205 cases of measles were reported in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six countries reporting measles case this year are Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and the United States, with the United States reporting the largest outbreak, at 900 cases.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Difficulty in maintaining adequate levels of vaccination in the migrant population, vaccine-hesitant groups and other at-risk populations within the Region are big challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Difficulty in maintaining adequate levels of vaccination in the migrant population, vaccine-hesitant groups and other at-risk populations within the Region are big challenges," &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON565"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the WHO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said. "Given that several countries in Europe, Central Asia and Africa have areas of circulation of the virus, the identification of imported cases from these areas is expected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More travel-related US cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In US developments, &lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/austintexas/second-measles-case-reported-in-travis-county?e=b0a255979d"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Austin, Texas, health officials&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported the second case in Travis County, in a vaccinated adult who had traveled to a state outside Texas that is experiencing a measles outbreak.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a group of friends gets together at a bar or gathers for an intimate dinner, conversations can quickly multiply and mix, with different groups and pairings chatting over and across one another.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Navigating this lively jumble of words—and focusing on the ones that matter—is particularly difficult for people with some form of hearing loss. Bustling conversations can become a fused mess of chatter, even if someone has hearing aids, which often struggle to filter out background noise. It's known as the "cocktail party problem"—and Boston University researchers believe they might have a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new brain-inspired &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/algorithm/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;algorithm&lt;/a&gt; developed at BU could help hearing aids tune out interference and isolate single talkers in a crowd of voices. In testing, researchers found it could improve word recognition accuracy by 40 percentage points relative to current hearing aid algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were extremely surprised and excited by the magnitude of the improvement in performance—it's pretty rare to find such big improvements," says Kamal Sen, the algorithm's developer and a BU College of Engineering associate professor of biomedical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44172-025-00414-5" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Communications Engineering&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some estimates put the number of Americans with hearing loss at close to 50 million; by 2050, around 2.5 billion people globally are expected to have some form of hearing loss, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The primary complaint of people with hearing loss is that they have trouble communicating in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/noisy+environments/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;noisy environments&lt;/a&gt;," says Virginia Best, a BU Sargent College of Health &amp;amp; Rehabilitation Sciences research associate professor of speech, language, and hearing sciences. "These environments are very common in daily life and they tend to be really important to people—think about dinner table conversations, social gatherings, workplace meetings. So, solutions that can enhance communication in noisy places have the potential for a huge impact."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Best was a co-author on the study with Sen and BU biomedical engineering Ph.D. candidate Alexander D. Boyd. As part of the research, they also tested the ability of current hearing aid algorithms to cope with the cacophony of cocktail parties. Many hearing aids already include noise-reduction algorithms and directional microphones (beamformers) designed to emphasize sounds coming from the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We decided to benchmark against the industry standard algorithm that's currently in hearing aids," says Sen. That existing algorithm "doesn't improve performance at all; if anything, it makes it slightly worse. Now we have data showing what's been known anecdotally from people with hearing aids."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen has patented the new algorithm—known as BOSSA, which stands for biologically oriented sound segregation algorithm—and is hoping to connect with companies interested in licensing the technology. He says that with Apple jumping into the hearing aid market—its latest AirPod Pro 2 headphones are advertised as having a clinical-grade hearing aid function—the BU team's breakthrough is timely: "If hearing aid companies don't start innovating fast, they're going to get wiped out, because Apple and other startups are entering the market."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Successfully segregating sounds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past 20 years, Sen has been studying how the brain encodes and decodes sounds, looking for the circuits involved in managing the cocktail party effect. With researchers in his Natural Sounds &amp;amp; Neural Coding Laboratory, he's plotted how sound waves are processed at different stages of the auditory pathway, tracking their journey from the ear to translation by the brain. One key mechanism: inhibitory neurons, brain cells that help suppress certain, unwanted sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"You can think of it as a form of internal noise cancelation," he says. "If there's a sound at a particular location, these inhibitory neurons get activated."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Sen, different neurons are tuned to different locations and frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain's approach is the inspiration for the new algorithm, which uses spatial cues like the volume and timing of a sound to tune into or tune out of it, sharpening or muffling a speaker's words as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's basically a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/computational+model/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;computational model&lt;/a&gt; that mimics what the brain does," says Sen, who's affiliated with BU's centers for neurophotonics and for systems neuroscience, "and actually segregates sound sources based on sound input."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A physicist who later trained in neuroscience, Sen says he came to BU in part because of the opportunity to work with the University's Hearing Research Center, where he's now a faculty member. He turned to clinical researchers for help testing the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, the only way to know if a benefit will translate to the listener is via behavioral studies," says Best, an expert on spatial perception and hearing loss, "and that requires scientists and clinicians who understand the target population."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formerly a research scientist at Australia's National Acoustic Laboratories, Best helped design a study using a group of young adults with sensorineural hearing loss, typically caused by genetic factors or childhood diseases. In a lab, participants wore headphones that simulated people talking from different nearby locations. Their ability to pick out select speakers was tested with the aid of the new algorithm, the current standard algorithm, and no algorithm. Boyd helped collect much of the data and was the lead author on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;h2&gt;Applying the science beyond hearing loss: ADHD and autism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting their findings, the researchers wrote that the "biologically inspired algorithm led to robust intelligibility gains under conditions in which a standard beamforming approach failed. The results provide compelling support for the potential benefits of biologically inspired algorithms for assisting individuals with hearing loss in 'cocktail party' situations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're now in the early stages of testing an upgraded version that incorporates eye-tracking technology to allow users to better direct their listening attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science powering the algorithm might have implications beyond hearing loss too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The [neural] circuits we are studying are much more general purpose and much more fundamental," says Sen. "It ultimately has to do with attention, where you want to focus—that's what the circuit was really built for. In the long term, we're hoping to take this to other populations, like people with ADHD or autism, who also really struggle when there are multiple things happening."&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers showed that dopamine from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) drives the brain’s positive learning process during fear extinction, rather than simply suppressing fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disruption of this dopamine-driven pathway impaired the ability to unlearn fear, suggesting critical implications for anxiety and PTSD treatments. The findings highlight a precise neural mechanism that could lead to targeted therapies for fear-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teaching Signal:&lt;/strong&gt; Dopamine release from the VTA activates specific amygdala neurons to drive fear extinction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; Fear extinction involves a reward-based learning process, not just suppression of fear memories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting the pBLA-VTA dopamine pathway could aid treatments for PTSD and anxiety disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dangers come but dangers also go and when they do, the brain has an “all-clear” signal that teaches it to extinguish its fear. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study in mice by MIT neuroscientists shows that the signal is the release of dopamine along a specific interregional brain circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109271"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-fear-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Meanwhile in the Rspo2 cells, knocking down receptors reduced the freezing behavior. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research therefore pinpoints a potentially critical mechanism of mental health, restoring calm when it works, but prolonging anxiety or even post-traumatic stress disorder when it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dopamine is essential to initiate fear extinction,” said Michele Pignatelli di Spinazzola, co-author of the new study from the lab of senior author Susumu Tonegawa, Picower Professor of biology and neuroscience at the RIKEN-MIT Laboratory for Neural Circuit Genetics in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and an HHMI Investigator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020 Tonegawa’s lab showed that learning to be afraid, and then learning when that’s no longer necessary, result from a competition between populations of cells in the brain’s amygdala region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a mouse learns that a place is “dangerous” (because it gets a little foot shock there), the fear memory is encoded by neurons in the anterior of the basolateral amygdala (aBLA) that express the gene Rspo2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the mouse then learns that a place is no longer associated with danger (because they wait there and the zap doesn’t recur), neurons in the posterior basolateral amygdala (pBLA) that express the gene Ppp1r1b encode a new fear extinction memory that overcomes the original dread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably those same neurons encode feelings of reward, helping to explain why it feels so good when we realize that an expected danger has dwindled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the lab, led by former members Xiangyu Zhang and Katelyn Flick, sought to determine what prompts these amygdala neurons to encode these memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rigorous set of experiments the team reports in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; show that it’s dopamine sent to the different amygdala populations from distinct groups of neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study uncovers a precise mechanism by which dopamine helps the brain unlearn fear,” said Zhang, who also led the 2020 study and is now Senior Associate at Orbimed, a healthcare investment firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that dopamine activates specific amygdala neurons tied to reward, which in turn drive fear extinction. We now see that unlearning fear isn’t just about suppressing it—it’s a positive learning process powered by the brain’s reward machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens up new avenues for understanding and potentially treating fear-related disorders like PTSD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgetting fear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VTA was the lab’s prime suspect to be the source of the signal because the region is well known for encoding surprising experiences and instructing the brain, with dopamine, to learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first set of experiments in the paper used multiple methods for tracing neural circuits to see whether and how cells in the VTA and the amygdala connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found a clear pattern: Rspo2 neurons were targeted by dopaminergic neurons in the anterior and left and right sides of the VTA. Ppp1r1b neurons received dopaminergic input from neurons in the center and posterior sections of the VTA. The density of connections was greater on the Ppp1r1b neurons than for the Rspo2 ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circuit tracing showed that dopamine is available to amygdala neurons that encode fear and its extinction, but do those neurons care about dopamine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team showed that indeed they express “D1” receptors for the neuromodulator. Commensurate with the degree of dopamine connectivity, Ppp1r1b cells had more receptors than Rspo2 neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine does a lot of things, so the next question was whether its activity in the amygdala actually correlated with fear encoding and extinction. Using a method to track and visualize it in the brain, the team watched dopamine in the amygdala as mice underwent a three-day experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On day one they went to an enclosure where they experienced three little zaps on the feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On day two they went back to the enclosure for 45 minutes where they didn’t experience any new shocks –at first the mice froze in fear but then relaxed after about 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On day 3 they returned again to test whether they had indeed extinguished the fear they showed at the beginning of day 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dopamine activity tracking revealed that during the shocks on day 1, Rspo2 neurons had the larger response to dopamine, but in the early moments of day 2 when the anticipated shocks didn’t come and the mice eased up on freezing in fear, the Ppp1r1b neurons showed the stronger dopamine activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More strikingly, the mice that learned to extinguish their fear most strongly also showed the greatest dopamine signal at those neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Causal connections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final sets of experiments sought to show that dopamine is not just available and associated with fear encoding and extinction, but also actually causes them. In one set, they turned to optogenetics, a technology that enables scientists to activate or quiet neurons with different colors of light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, when they quieted VTA dopaminergic inputs in the pBLA, doing so impaired fear extinction. When they activated those inputs, it accelerated fear extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were surprised that when they activated VTA dopaminergic inputs into the aBLA they could reinstate fear even without any new foot shocks, impairing fear extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other way they confirmed a causal role for dopamine in fear encoding and extinction was to manipulate the amygdala neurons’ dopamine receptors. In Ppp1r1b neurons, overexpressing dopamine receptors impaired fear recall and promoted extinction, whereas knocking the receptors down impaired fear extinction. Meanwhile in the Rspo2 cells, knocking down receptors reduced the freezing behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We showed that fear extinction requires VTA dopaminergic activity in the pBLA Ppp1r1b neurons by using optogenetic inhibition of VTA terminals and cell-type-specific knockdown of D1 receptors in these neurons,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists are careful in the study to note that while they’ve identified the “teaching signal” for fear extinction learning, the broader phenomenon of fear extinction occurs brainwide, rather than in just this single circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the circuit seems to be a key node to consider as drug developers and psychiatrists work to combat anxiety and PTSD, Pignatelli di Spinazzola said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fear learning and fear extinction provide a strong framework to study generalized anxiety and PTSD,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study investigates the underlying mechanisms suggesting multiple targets for a translational approach such as pBLA and use of dopaminergic modulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marianna Rizzo is also a co-author of the study.

However, the neurological nature of the teaching signal that instructs the formation of fear extinction memory in the &lt;em&gt;Ppp1r1b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; neurons is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we demonstrate that ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic signaling drives fear extinction in distinct BLA neuronal populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that BLA fear and extinction neuronal populations receive topographically divergent inputs from VTA dopaminergic neurons via differentially expressed dopamine receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber photometry recordings of dopaminergic activity in the BLA reveal that dopamine (DA) activity is time-locked to freezing cessation in BLA fear extinction neurons, but not BLA fear neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this dopaminergic activity in BLA fear extinction neurons correlates with extinction learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, using projection-specific optogenetic manipulation, we find that activation of the VTA DA projections to BLA reward and fear neurons accelerated or impaired fear extinction, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, this work demonstrates that dopaminergic activity bidirectionally controls fear extinction by distinct patterns of activity at BLA fear and extinction neurons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 20:27:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTFBFdzJ5RTNFUFkteU1OZy10OTl6dTFQMkpDRG1ybUZHRDV4Sjhha094RVk5RWx0clJKcEFSZVhnZm80b1hZQ2V2Mi1CQy1GaE5Nd21ySkVKejQySlN0c0VzM0hmQQ</guid></item><item><title>弗吉尼亚州扩大了对接触麻疹儿童的地区的警告-《华盛顿邮报》 | Virginia expands warning on areas exposed to child with measles - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQeVhSOGVNTzYtNDNiZlVObGpFZHNhb3VDWGNITnI1MHQ2bUFSRFlkUlIybWhNOHF0aklIckRfRG1qcEtFYTZOakttSUVzUThtTzlsREhCZ3J6SVZXblRtNC1ldnZxbXBlVDZrR2I1XzRPdEMxRWZiZXIyYUNPWTdZUWhpdWdSQ0M1QnN2VFo1ZkpFRkg4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2K2KGPARLJCYJGX4S5NHWVETCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Virginia public health officials on Monday released more detail on the areas in local medical facilities where people may have been exposed to a young child with the state’s first 2025 case of measles, a highly contagious disease on the rise across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5ZA7ZVDSFRCPBM2AZ43K6NGKLQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The child, who was described as age 4 or younger, was contagious while visiting Kaiser Permanente medical facilities in Fredericksburg and Woodbridge on two days in mid-April, according to a statement from the Virginia Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B667WQMJURH6HOCIOY4BO4C2PY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/04/19/virginia-measles-northern-exposed-child/"&gt;The Virginia case&lt;/a&gt; stems from international travel, and not a measles outbreak in West Texas that has led to the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/06/measles-texas-death-outbreak-vaccine/"&gt;deaths of two children&lt;/a&gt;, officials said.

&lt;p&gt;The result could transform efforts to reach the three-quarters of children globally who should receive the vaccines but don’t. The shots prevent cervical cancer and also anal, penile, and some head-and-neck cancers. Worldwide, 350,000 women die from cervical cancer, the most common HPV cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think we can all agree that one dose and two doses of … these fantastic vaccines work really well,” said Aimée R. Kreimer, the NCI investigator who presented the new data here Monday at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research. “We’re really excited about these results.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In developed countries, including the U.S., two doses of the vaccines are currently recommended. But in the clinical trial, whether one dose or two doses were used, the results were equivalent, according to the study of 20,000 girls between ages 12 and 16 in Costa Rica who were followed for 4 1/2 years. In all cases, the estimated efficacy of the vaccines was upwards of 97%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experts were fast to praise the results. Chyke A. Doubeni, chief health equity officer The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, called them “phenomenal” from the conference stage. He grew up in Nigeria and said he could imagine the findings could help expand access to more people in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Norman “Ned” Sharpless, who was NCI director in the first Trump administration and is now a managing director at Jupiter Bioventures, echoed those comments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think this is the most important cancer prevention trial going on in the world. We have a long history of failure in cancer prevention,” Sharpless said. “To have such clear evidence to support our practice is terrific and this will make the dissemination of HPV vaccine worldwide much easier and much cheaper to do — and it will save millions of lives.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The results could prove controversial not because of science but U.S. politics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has long criticized HPV vaccines, particularly Gardasil, made by Merck, which is the HPV vaccine used in the U.S. Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1618279143468306435" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;asserted on social media&lt;/a&gt; that Gardasil may increase the risk of cervical cancer, a claim contradicted by many studies. During his Senate confirmation hearing, he refused to disavow previous comments he had made questioning the safety of the vaccine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Children’s Health Defense, the nonprofit group where he served as founder and chairman for years, Kennedy&lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/victoria-trevisan-gardasil-hpv-vaccine-injury-merck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; filed more than two dozen lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; over the vaccine. During the nomination process, he promised to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/31/rfk-jr-hhs-gardasil-litigation-fees-divest-son-wisner-baum/"&gt;give any fees&lt;/a&gt; he earned from the Gardasil litigation to his son.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But from the start, the development of the HPV vaccines and studies of them could be traced back to the NCI, which is part of HHS. The institute’s deputy director, currently its highest-ranking official, is Douglas Lowy, who was a key figure in the development of the vaccines. He has won multiple scientific prizes, including the National Medal of Technology and Innovation and the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award, for his work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The NCI has also spent decades studying how to increase the uptake of hepatitis B and HPV vaccines as a way of preventing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In developed countries, the HPV vaccines have had a dramatic impact. In the U.S., Kreimer said, they have decreased the incidence of precancerous cervical lesions by 80% — particularly impressive because only 77% of people in the U.S. who should receive the vaccine have been administered at least one dose. In the U.S. and other developed countries, effective screening against these lesions means that other types of HPV cancer, in particular head-and-neck cancer, are as common as cervical cancer. This is one reason vaccination is recommended for boys as well as girls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies across the world have affirmed that HPV vaccination does prevent cancer. In one &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/25/hpv-vaccine-prevent-cervical-cancer-cervarix-gardasil-study/"&gt;stunning recent example&lt;/a&gt;, Scotland said in 2024 that, of girls in the country who were born between 1988-1996 and had been vaccinated in time, none had been diagnosed with cervical cancer. Australia has said that it believes it can eliminate cervical cancer through vaccination and screening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, giving two shots of the vaccine has been difficult to achieve on a wide scale among adolescents — a reality that cancer prevention experts have long lamented. In 2019, only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6933a1.htm?s_cid=mm6933a1_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;54.2%&lt;/a&gt; of adolescents had received two shots of an HPV vaccination. But these new data suggest that the picture is perhaps not as dire as originally feared.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In less developed countries, screening for cervical pre-cancers is far less common. These have always been the places where the HPV vaccines could have the biggest impact — but, because the vaccines are costly and because having to give multiple shots of a vaccine makes rolling it out more difficult in these countries — the vaccines have had the least impact there. In her talk, Kreimer said that only 24% of the girls who should get the vaccine worldwide do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why showing that one dose of the vaccines is as effective as two could be so important. And much of this important work has come from the NCI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rolando Herrero, one of the researchers involved in the new study, was the lead investigator of a study that in 2007 first raised the prospect that fewer doses of an HPV vaccine could be just as effective. That study, the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial, tested three doses of the vaccine Cervarix, which was the dosage used at the time. But 20% of the volunteers in the study received fewer than three doses, in part because there were contraindications to receiving other doses — including becoming pregnant. It appeared that those who received only one dose were protected from HPV just as well as those who were fully vaccinated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This flew in the face of vaccine dogma,” Kreimer said. At the time, researchers thought protein-based vaccines like Cervarix always needed at least two doses to result in a durable result.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the finding led to other research, including a study in India where a trial stoppage meant that many patients only received one dose of the vaccine. The World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/11-04-2022-one-dose-human-papillomavirus-(hpv)-vaccine-offers-solid-protection-against-cervical-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;moved to recommend&lt;/a&gt; a one-dose HPV vaccine course. The U.K. also moved to recommend giving just one dose in 2023.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There will not be much debate about using one dose in countries where vaccination has proved difficult. Kathrin Jansen, who led development of Gardasil at Merck and is now retired, noted that in a setting where people are not vaccinated one dose is certainly better than none.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think there’s going to be any finding in the recent past that’s going to democratize cervical cancer control as much as these studies have,” said CS Pramesh, of the Tata Memorial Centre in Mumbai, from the AACR stage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there is a question of how quickly the U.S. will consider moving to a single-dose regimen. There are still gaps in the data. For instance, researchers could want more follow-up on vaccine durability. And there are no data on other types of cancers HPV causes, particularly with regard to cancers of the mouth and throat. Still, in recent deliberations, the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has seemed open to a change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Merck’s recent earnings calls, the company’s chief scientific officer, Dean Li, pushed back against the idea that such a move would come quickly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I would just emphasize: we have had clear , firm, consistent, and recent guidance from the FDA on what  [they] would require for the licensure of a reduced dosing or a single dose. They are very clear on the high evidentiary standard,” Li said, according to a transcript. He added: “The FDA is incredibly up-to-date and aware of the limitations of existing trials, and none meet the criteria for them to have a label change.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kreimer pointed out that the benefit of change could be measured in lives saved.  &lt;br&gt;“Cervical cancer is a horrible disease, and outside the U.S., in lower-income countries, it is a death sentence the incidence is the mortality,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Better then, to keep the cancer from ever happening in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

When doctors received the results, they urged her to go to the emergency room immediately. She learned she had acute myeloid leukemia, an aggressive blood cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I felt so scared. I kind of blacked out,” she recalls. “I was like, ‘There’s no way she just said that. No way.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Sinus infection leads to cancer diagnosis &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While the months-long headache and pressure in her nose felt annoying, Hunter thought she simply had a sinus infection she couldn’t kick. When she struggled to walk up stairs or to class at Texas A&amp;amp;M, she became worried. At a follow-up appointment in October 2024, she shared her new symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I told them that the headaches are still here. I’m very weak and had fatigue,” she says. “They recommended doing a blood test.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hunter loathes needles, yet she finally agreed to undergo the testing after the doctor’s urging. When her results first came back, Hunter didn’t realize how serious they were. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The clinic staffer said, ‘Your levels are all over the place and it’s not looking good. (You’re) very anemic,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While they urged her to head to the emergency room, she only heard anemic and thought she could simply pick up iron pills at a pharmacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They’re like, ‘No no, I don’t think that will work,’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hunter tried going to an emergency room close to campus but they were full, so she decided to drive home to League City, Texas. She had Googled her blood results and thought she figured out what was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was like, ‘Mom, I think I have leukemia,’” Hunter says. “She’s like, ‘Don’t say that. That’s not what you have.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When she arrived at the emergency room, they admitted her and ran numerous tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had many people coming in and saying, ‘It’s looking like a sign of leukemia, but we’ll keep testing because it could be a bunch of other things,’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-05-4c9bbb.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-05-4c9bbb.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-05-4c9bbb.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-05-4c9bbb.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-05-4c9bbb.jpg" alt="It felt tough spending so much time in the hospital while undergoing cancer treatments.

I was like am I going to survive this? Or is it treatable?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors transferred to MD Anderson in Houston, where Hunter underwent more blood tests for doctors to understand what type of leukemia she had and how to best treat it. She also underwent a bone marrow aspiration and a spinal tap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors determined she had high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and she needed to remain in the hospital for treatment, which included seven days straight of chemotherapy infusions with a pill, which was part of a clinical trial. After 21 days, doctors tested Hunter’s bone marrow again to see if the treatment worked and she did a second seven-day round of chemotherapy with the pill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was supposed to get at least six rounds,” Hunter says. “The chemo worked so well I only had to do two.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors believed she would do best with a stem cell transplant and her brother, Roy, 21, was a perfect match. After undergoing 11 rounds of radiation to kill any possible lingering cancer cells in her brain and spine plus an new intense round of chemotherapy, she underwent the transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I got a radiation/chemo burn all over my body, which was very very painful and I was pretty much burnt all over,” she says. The chemotherapy regimen “was harder than the leukemia one.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Following the transplant, she remained in the hospital for more than a month to make sure everything went well and protect her from potential infection from her weakened immune system.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Probably towards the end I was over it. I was like, ‘I can’t do this. This is too much,’” Hunter recalls. “It was very hard at times but God’s watching me. So, I knew I was going to be OK.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Acute myeloid leukemia &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Acute myeloid leukemia is a type of blood cancer. It is actually one of the most common blood cancers in adults,” Dr. Courtney DiNardo, professor of leukemia at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, tells TODAY.com. “It can present quite dramatically with life threatening infections or bleeding problems or … blood abnormalities.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-04-10ac64.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-04-10ac64.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-04-10ac64.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-04-10ac64.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-04-10ac64.jpg" alt="Navigating cancer treatment during her final year of college has been challenging for Breeze Hunter but having the support of her family, friends and boyfriend has helped her. "&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Navigating cancer treatment during her final year of college has been challenging for Breeze Hunter but having the support of her family, friends and boyfriend has helped her. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Breeze Hunter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s also common for some patients to have a persistent infection, such as sinus infection, soft tissue infection or even pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“AML is a cancer of your white blood cells of your immune system,” DiNardo says. “All of a sudden you have these abnormal cancerous white cells. But you really have lost your normal immune system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In these cases, people normally do not improve after treatments for their infections and follow-up tests indicate something amiss with their blood cell counts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Not everyone presents that way,” DiNardo explains. “But it is one of the presentations we see — strange infections,” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The clinical trial Hunter participated in was targeted to the type of “higher risk leukemia” she had that doesn’t “respond well to standard intensive chemotherapy.” AML isn’t staged like other cancers and high risk or adverse risk is the most serious form that has “certain features that make them less likely to go into a remission and less likely to stay in a remission and be cured,” DiNardo says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The response rates are low, and unfortunately, many people don’t survive,” DiNardo says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-025-02531-8.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Phase II investigation&lt;/a&gt; Hunter participated in is aimed at patients who have the same type of acute myeloid leukemia she has with a KMT2A translocation. Hunter received a chemotherapy regimen called FLAG-IDA with a pill called venetoclax. The pill is FDA approved for older patients who cannot handle powerful cancer treatments, DiNardo says. In Hunter’s case, she underwent an “intensive chemotherapy program with venetoclax added in as part of a clinical trial.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We are seeing such phenomenal outcomes, and this is not an FDA approved regimen yet,” DiNardo says. “We continue to expand this trial to enroll more patients and allow more patients to benefit.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hunter responded well to the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“She’s doing fantastic,” DiNardo says. “Being a college student in the prime of your life getting dealt a life-threatening cancer diagnosis, I can only imagine how life altering and depressing it could be. But she’s always had such a beautiful spirit and good attitude.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;'It keeps me positive' &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While in the hospital, Hunter decided to document her experience. She even created a MTV “Cribs” type TikTok of her hospital room that went viral. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We did it as a joke and I posted it and it blew up instantly,” she says. “I have never gone viral.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People shared their own experiences with AML or different cancers and Hunter met new friends that helped her navigate her experience with cancer. After the local news reported on Hunter, she met a young girl, Zoe, who has the same cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“She’s 6 years old and she’s had a lot of side effects and problems,” Hunter says. “We’re best friends ... she is so young, and she has gone through way more than I have and it keeps me positive.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After the intense treatment, Hunter finally feels better. Her immune system is strengthening, and she will be able to walk in her college graduation. It will be the first time she can be around such a large crowd of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’m so excited,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Having her friends and family’s support as well as a strong faith helps Hunter cope with her diagnosis. She’ll be on maintenance chemotherapy for the next year but then she’s looking forward to swimming and boating again. Hunter hopes her story encourages others to take their health seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-03-038bf5.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-03-038bf5.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-03-038bf5.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-03-038bf5.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-03-038bf5.jpg" alt="After the local news shared Breeze Hunter's story, she met Zoe, on the left, who is 6 and has the same type of cancer as Hunter.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Miami Miller School of Medicine researchers have identified molecular evidence linking human papillomavirus (HPV) to thyroid eye disease (TED) through molecular mimicry involving HPV capsid proteins and autoimmune targets. Elevated antibody levels against HPV appeared in participants with TED, suggesting a possible immunological connection influencing disease development.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;TED is marked by complex autoimmune features and unclear triggers. Managing its varied clinical manifestations remains a challenge. Symptoms include proptosis, diplopia, pain, dryness, and redness. Severe cases can lead to vision loss in 2% to 5% of patients. Among those with Graves disease, TED affects 25% to 50%, and among those with Hashimoto thyroiditis, 3% to 5%. TED also appears in individuals with euthyroidism and hypothyroidism, suggesting additional mechanisms beyond thyroid dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autoantibodies that up-regulate insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) have been primarily implicated. Yet TED cases without thyroid dysfunction prompted hypotheses involving &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/molecular+mimicry/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular mimicry&lt;/a&gt; by pathogens. Reports of TED following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection reinforced this theory and suggested that an infectious agent could trigger autoimmune responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study titled "Human Papillomavirus and Thyroid Eye Disease," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2832966" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Ophthalmology&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted an experimental study to explore the potential involvement of viral infections in TED pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orbital adipose tissue samples were collected from 11 patients with TED undergoing orbital decompression surgery and 11 control patients undergoing blepharoplasty. Among the 22 patients, the mean age was 58.6 years, ranging from 37.4 to 74.4 years. Female patients accounted for 86.4% of the study population.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Researchers used the publicly available Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) to perform protein homology analysis comparing IGF-1R and TSHR against various viral proteomes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) measured &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+papillomavirus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt; type 18 (HPV18) L1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels from the collected adipose tissue samples. Optical density (OD) readings from ELISA measured HPV18 L1 IgG antibody levels. OD values were used to estimate the extent of antibody binding detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis revealed that IGF-1R and TSHR shared homologous sequences with major capsid proteins of the Papillomaviridae family, as well as proteins from Paramyxoviridae, Herpesviridae, Enteroviruses, Polyomaviridae, and Rhabdoviridae families. Two conserved motifs, FGXV and IXEXT+NP, were identified across all HPV serotypes and both human IGF-1R and TSHR sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mean normalized OD levels for HPV18 L1 IgG differed between groups. Controls had a mean OD of 0.94. Patients with chronic TED had a mean OD of approximately 2.31, and patients with acute active TED had a mean OD of approximately 4.09. Both chronic and acute active TED groups showed higher normalized OD levels compared with controls, with acute active TED displaying the highest levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No correlations appeared between HPV18 L1 IgG levels and thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, or thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin levels. Radioactive iodine treatment or thyroidectomy did not affect antibody levels. Elevated IgG titers appeared irrespective of treatment with teprotumumab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers concluded that viral molecular mimicry between HPV and key autoimmunity targets, IGF-1R and TSHR, could contribute to the development of TED. Elevated antibodies against HPV18 L1 capsid protein in patients with TED suggest a potential immunological mechanism influencing disease pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identification of viral mimicry as a possible factor offers new possibilities for prevention strategies and therapeutic approaches. Although the study cohort is small and does not establish causation, recognizing viral exposure as a contributing factor could guide future diagnostic and treatment research.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They wrote: 'Understanding how mortality patterns vary by birth cohort within each state can inform decision-making around resource allocation and public health interventions.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average life expectancy in the US is 80 for women and 74 for men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published Monday in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833159?guestAccessKey=c0957767-f5eb-4d6d-88a4-15c747418b57&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=042825"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, collected mortality data from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics and calculated the number of deaths that occurred between 1969 and 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This resulted in 179million deaths in all 50 states and Washington &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/washington-dc/index.html" id="mol-b6fecec0-2463-11f0-b9de-a9e256473e2a"&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though life expectancy for men increased in most states, rates stayed the same as the 1990s for men in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/west-virginia/index.html" id="mol-2314a020-2460-11f0-9a11-571ce7507e68"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, New Mexico&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/louisiana/index.html" id="mol-2314a021-2460-11f0-9a11-571ce7507e68"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and Kentucky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Men in West Virginia lived to 70 in both 1995 and 2020. The same was true for Kentucky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In New Mexico, men lived to 72 in 1995 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And women in Mississippi, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas and Oklahoma all saw drops from the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Mississippi, for example, the life expectancy for women dropped from 76 to 75. West Virginia, Arkansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Alabama each saw a drop from 77 to 76. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's unclear exactly why these states saw decreases, the researchers suggested it could be due to increasing rates of poverty and chronic disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, Mississippi is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13684195/South-state-diabetes-cancer-kidney-disease-healthcare-rank-Mississippi.html"&gt;the poorest state&lt;/a&gt; in the US and has the lowest median household income per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average household brings home $48,716 before taxes, according to World Population Review, significantly lower than the national average of $80,610.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poverty limits access to healthy foods, medications and regular doctor's appointments, increasing the risk of developing chronic conditions like obesity and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest CDC data, Mississippi has the second-highest rate of heart disease deaths behind Oklahoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And West Virginia &lt;span&gt;has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-12943237/West-Virginia-America-UNHEALTHIEST-state.html"&gt;consistently topped the charts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for rates of chronic disease. More than half of West Virginia's residents are obese, for example, and it has the nation's highest smoking rate of 23 percent. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The average life expectancy in the US is 77. Women have an average life expectancy of 80 while men are expected to live to 74&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, Washington DC saw the greatest improvement in life expectancy from 1969 to 2020, jumping from 70 to 80 years for women and 61 to 73 for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could be due in part to Washington DC having the country's lowest obesity rate of 23 percent. Additionally, the researchers wrote the city's small population could make it more sensitive to statistical changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The city of 678,000 is also entirely urban, giving it increased access to healthy foods and healthcare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also calculated the number of years it would take in each state for the death rate of people over 35 to double.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This measures how quickly the mortality rate increases with age. The shorter the rate, the faster death rates surge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Iowa, the death rate for women doubles at age 43, the fastest rate in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Washington DC, however, the rate doubles for women starting at age 47, the study's slowest rate. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, Mississippi &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-10499713/Mississippi-lowest-levels-life-expectancy-20-live-poverty-74-4-years.html"&gt;had the lowest life expectancy in 2020 for both men and women.&lt;/a&gt; The average age for men was 69, while women lived to 76. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following closely behind for both sexes was West Virginia with 70 years for men and 76 for women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For women, Kentucky and Alabama tied for third-lowest life expectancy at 76.4 years. Arkansas and Oklahoma rounded out the top five, tying for a life expectancy of 77 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For men, Alabama and Louisiana both had a life expectancy of 70 years. Kentucky rounded out the top five with a life expectancy of 71 years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Hawaii had the highest life expectancy for both sexes with 84 years for women and 77 for men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could be due to low rates of chronic disease. The Aloha state had the second-lowest heart disease mortality rate in 2022, for example, behind Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Hawaii has the third-lowest obesity rate of 26 percent, outranked only by Colorado and Washington DC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations of the study, including a lack of data on how Covid may have altered the average life expectancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 19:14:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNZEpFODNIRjM5ZDVaS21YYVZKdTdFYlZYT2g5eUlILUZRLWNzdGtiTDMyQ2VzYml1SVdhZVpZdjc3dk1LY3p3WGphTEZ0MlJDbVZnQUtDNFBYdnMyTlRGR0poX21VNVdtVDJRclRvb1BCSWFyNENpZF9PQkxCemFrOWFwb25TNG80SmJuUnJxQ2JfWmNQakdVZzN4QWNzb2NaakV5SkZn0gGrAUFVX3lxTE9xaGZ1d0dXZU0zWlhVWVJyQVp2N3F0bGppRkVZS1V2T1dmNjBoTFdKTzFBdEM5eEpFNEphX1h2bWJYd1BROGxULUwtZVNTdjlQMldxeUNxU05mY21hZXBJMGtCdDJxbmhnRVdhMTIzTllwaWRFcUFMTnhPVXpYZmNLUWhQYTgwM1llczRwOFBKR29CZG41UVBCcDFNZUlHY1RadXp6LVhHQU45UQ</guid></item><item><title>超加工食品与美国124,000多例可预防死亡有关- Healthline | Ultra-Processed Foods Tied to More Than 124,000 Preventable Deaths in U.S. - Healthline</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxOTEhUa291UGttbEZScVRNSXlOWndmWm9mN0FxYTRLcm41d2JfZWtOSktwVTY4aEozTVNUVDRBR2llc1ZnT1JwTnJHdjZuNFFtUkRBYTVhSDl4UE13LXJuT25JbFZ4b2NVeU5TMWlXYlRmLWNQeWdaOFJNMExWTnhBM0VJbzdTOFVacWhmeVBnRTQ2QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/processed-food-1296x728-header.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/processed-food-1296x728-header.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/processed-food-1296x728-header.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/processed-food-1296x728-header.jpg" alt="Overhead image of cheeseburger and fries" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-1dn5h5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healthline.com%2Fhealth-news%2Fultraprocessed-foods-premature-death-global-study&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F04%2Fprocessed-food-1296x728-header.jpg&amp;amp;description=Ultra-Processed%20Foods%20Linked%20to%20Over%20124%2C000%20Premature%20Deaths%20in%20U.S." title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/processed-food-1296x728-header.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-1dutyn6"&gt;A global study linked thousands of preventable deaths to ultra-processed food consumption.

The average contribution of &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/more-evidence-links-ultra-processed-foods-to-premature-preventable-death" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; to the total energy intake also varied among countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lowest consumption of ultra-processed foods was in Colombia (2015) and Brazil (2017–2018), where less than 20% of total energy intake was made up of ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chile (2010) and Mexico (2016), the intake increased to 20–30% of total energy intake. In Australia (2011–2012) and Canada (2016), the ratio of ultra-processed food intake increased significantly, with UPFs comprising 37.5% of daily energy intake in Australia and 43.7% in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States (2017–2018) and the United Kingdom (2018–2019), the contribution of UPFs to total energy intake exceeded 50%. These nations had the highest number of premature deaths associated with UPFs, with nearly 18,000 in the U.K. and more than 124,000 in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/christopher-gardner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Christopher Gardner&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a nutrition scientist and professor of medicine at Stanford University, said the findings are an important addition to the research into ultra-processed foods. Gardner wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The authors showed that regardless of the general consumption levels, there were consistently higher &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/morbidity-vs-mortality" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;mortality &lt;/a&gt;levels among the subset of the population within each of those countries who consumed the most vs. the least UPF. In other words, even in a country where only 15% of the food being sold was UPF, those consuming the most vs. the least had detectably different rates of mortality,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; “It would/should be easier to see that difference in a country like the U.S. or U.K. where the general consumption rate is much higher. Helpful to note that they also found it across the range of consumption levels in different countries. That is an interesting and important addition the field of knowledge about UPF. They should get credit for adding that to our knowledge base.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst there is no universally accepted definition of ultra-processed foods, the term is typically used to describe foods that are ready to eat or heat and are made in industrial settings, using little or no &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/plant-based-diet-guide" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;whole foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods are often considered convenient, highly palatable, and contain ingredients to make them more appealing. These may include coloring, emulsifiers, thickeners, flavoring, bulking agents, antifoaming agents, and sweeteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many high income countries, ultra-processed foods already account for more than half of the average daily energy intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;hl-trusted-source source="BMJ" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;2024 review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; involving nearly 9.8 million participants concluded that a diet of ultra-processed foods is associated with 32 adverse physical and mental health problems, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is concerning that, while in high-income countries UPF consumption is already high but relatively stable for over a decade, in low- and middle-income countries the consumption has continuously increased, meaning that while the attributable burden in high-income countries is currently higher, it is growing in the other countries,” Nilson noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1081137?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;press statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This shows that policies that disincentivize the consumption of UPFs are urgently needed globally, promoting traditional dietary patterns based on local fresh and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/junk-food-vs-healthy-food" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;minimally processed foods&lt;/a&gt;,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/dana-hunnes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Dana Hunnes&lt;/a&gt;, a senior dietitian and assistant professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said the findings are an important reminder of the benefits of reducing consumption of ultra-processed foods. Hunnes wasn’t involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The consumption of UPFs contribute quite significantly to an increased risk of death (and disease) and that we should all work harder (and encourage greater regulation) to reduce the consumption of UPFs both in our own lives and in the food systems as well,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(UPFs) are high in calories, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/too-much-sugar" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;, salt, fat, but low in nutrients. They are stripped of all their naturally occurring health properties. All fiber has essentially been removed, vitamins and minerals found naturally (ie. in the husk of a grain) have been removed, and in their place are chemicals and adulterated “foods” that bare no resemblance to their natural counterpart. By adding calories to the diet without concurrent vitamins, minerals, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/22-high-fiber-foods" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, and water, we are setting ourselves up for fast digestion/absorption, fat-deposition, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/insulin-and-insulin-resistance" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and the chronic diseases associated with all these problems,” Hunnes explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, more than &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37457-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;73%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; of the food supply in the United States is made up of ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, experts say Americans continue to choose UPFs along with other factors, such as convenience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Convenience is a large predictor of food choices. Due to the availability of fast food and fast-food choices in the supermarket as compared to other countries that prepare more food at home, the US may choose these foods more simply by having increased access to them,” &lt;a href="https://kanwarkelleymd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Kanwar Kelley&lt;/a&gt;, MD, JD, board certified otolaryngologist (ENT) and co-founder and CEO of Side Health told Healthline. Kelley wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-read-food-labels" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Food labeling&lt;/a&gt; can also be confusing; a food will not be advertised as ‘ultra processed,’ but instead tries to focus on the positive aspects of the food, such as how much of a particular vitamin it has. This may lead to some confusion,” Kelley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors say their findings prove that mortality attributed to ultra-processed food intake is significant and that addressing the rate of UPF consumption should be a global health priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experts note that changing &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthy-eating-tips" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;dietary habits&lt;/a&gt; on an individual level can be complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My perception is that most people are aware of the dangers of UPFs, but choose to ignore this,” &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, MD, board certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon, and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, told Healthline. Ali wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although education at an early age may help people make healthier food choices, most people do not look that critically at their diet and are more apt to choose food based on taste and convenience,” Ali said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whole grains, fresh fruits, vegetables, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lean-protein-foods" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;lean proteins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-healthy-nuts" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt; and dairy are healthier. In general fruits as an alternative to sweets like cookies and ice cream is better.

Although we do not yet know how to ‘cure’ Alzheimer’s disease, we are learning how to slow progression of memory decline so that affected individuals may have extended quality life experiences,” said Baker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker is the principal investigator of the &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.069700" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EXERT study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EXERT study&lt;/a&gt;, which was a clinical trial testing the effects of regular low vs. moderate-high intensity physical exercise on cognitive function over 12 months in older sedentary adults with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two new studies based on data from the EXERT study were recently published in &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/research/for_researchers/journals/alzheimers_dementia_journal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alzheimer’s and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These studies found that both low and moderate-high intensity exercise was correlated with significantly less cognitive decline over 12 months compared to older adults who did not exercise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, researchers found that participants in both exercise groups tended to show less brain volume loss over 12 months, including in the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318139" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:prefrontal cortex;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mild memory loss and everyday challenges&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For both of these studies, researchers focused on a type of MCI called &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-international-neuropsychological-society/article/identification-of-amnestic-mild-cognitive-impairment-among-black-and-white-communitydwelling-older-adults-using-nih-toolbox-cognition-tablet-battery/EFBF2F83181B01F0470CF7E8F440A43F" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a condition that describes a transitional state between normal cognition and significant cognitive impairment (dementia), which affects everyday function,” Baker explained. “The hallmark symptom of aMCI includes mild memory loss (relates to ‘amnestic’) that causes challenges for the individual on a day-to-day basis.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Casual acquaintances or more distant family members may not notice the memory loss, as the individual with aMCI is typically still able to go about the day’s business — working, cooking, errands, driving, etc.,” she continued. “The memory loss of those with aMCI may be ‘under the radar’ to most individuals, which can be a problem if this is the time when interventions could be most effective — before dementia develops.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals with aMCI often do not come to the attention of health care providers and therefore are frequently not referred for preventive interventions until the signs of early dementia emerge,” Baker added. “EXERT recruited individuals who were ‘under the radar’ to test the efficacy of a promising intervention to slow memory loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What levels of exercise intensity protect against cognitive decline?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.14586" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:first new study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;first new study&lt;/a&gt;, for which Baker is the lead author, included 296 older adults with aMCI. Participants were randomly assigned to either moderate-high intensity aerobic training or a group following low-intensity stretching, balance, and range of motion exercises for 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that participants’ cognitive levels remained stable for 12 months regardless of which type of exercise participants adhered to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70118" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:second study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt;, scientists found that participants with aMCI participating in moderate-high intensity aerobic or low-intensity flexibility exercise for 12 months had significantly less cognitive decline compared to those who did not exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Regular high or low intensity exercise may protect against cognitive decline in adults with mild cognitive impairment and thus at risk for dementia,” Baker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“In the past, moderate-high intensity exercise has been touted as necessary for cognitive benefit, however this level of intensity may not be attainable for all older individuals. Our findings suggest that any exercise, if completed regularly (three to four times per week for about 30-45 minutes) may be beneficial for brain health,” she said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;All exercise protects against brain volume loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that participants in both EXERT exercise groups tended to show less brain volume loss over 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In EXERT, our finding that participants tend to show less brain volume loss over 12 months suggests that the intervention may protect against cell loss in the prefrontal region, which may help to protect the cognitive abilities that this region supports, against decline,” &lt;a href="https://gerigeropal.ucsd.edu/research/faculty.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Aladdin Shadyab, PhD, MPH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Aladdin Shadyab, PhD, MPH&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor at the UC San Diego Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science and School of Medicine and lead author of the &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70118" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EXERT-ADNI study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EXERT-ADNI study&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The prefrontal cortex is an area of the brain that plays a proportionately larger role in cognitive abilities that allow us to pay attention, multi-task, plan, and organize,” Baker explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We all lose brain cells as we age.

These new studies are helping with evidence of how this connection may work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As the population ages, we must remember that lifestyle/behavioral factors can help to reduce the risk of cognitive decline, and possibly dementia, even when a person has a genetic risk factor.

&lt;p&gt;Measles has been in the headlines as of late. With more than 900 confirmed cases across the country so far in 2025, it is already the second most-active year for the disease since the United States declared measles eliminated in 2000, according to multiple reports, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/health/measles-outbreak-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;including The New York Times.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of measles cases this year are connected to an outbreak in the Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New York there have only been four confirmed measles cases this year, with three of them coming from New York City. There have been no confirmed cases of measles on the Upper West Side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the publication &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/how-well-is-your-nyc-neighborhood-protected-against-measles-check-out-our-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Gothamist created a map&lt;/a&gt; of the measles vaccination rates by ZIP code among children 24 to 35 months old in the five boroughs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rate of 95 percent is needed for herd immunity, but the citywide rate for this age group currently sits at around 81 percent, according to the data. This is a decline from an 88 percent vaccination rate in New York City in 2019 for the same age bracket, &lt;a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/newyork/2025/03/07/measles-cases-nyc-symptoms-how-to-protect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ChalkBeat reported.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the measles vaccination rates for kids 24 to 35 months old in each Upper West Side ZIP code, &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/how-well-is-your-nyc-neighborhood-protected-against-measles-check-out-our-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to Gothamist.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10025: 80 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10024: 87 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10023: 76 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10069: 82 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these vaccination rates are also expected to grow for this cohort of two-year-olds as they approach kindergarten, as New York has strict school vaccination rules that require children to get two doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of these doses, though, is generally given within the first 12 to 15 months of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state also does not allow for religious exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are numbers that are still deeply troubling,” Hochul said in a press conference about the measles vaccination rates in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lowest measles vaccination rates within New York City were seen on Staten Island, where no ZIP code had higher than 74 percent, according to Gothamist.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK — As you add more ultraprocessed foods to your diet, your risk of a premature death from any cause rises, according to a new meta-analysis of research involving more than 240,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We looked at the risk of a person dying from eating more ultraprocessed foods between the ages of 30 and 69, a time when it would be premature to die," said study coauthor Carlos Augusto Monteiro, emeritus professor of nutrition and public health in the School of Public Health at Brazil's University of São Paulo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that for each 10% increase in total calories from ultraprocessed foods, the risk of dying prematurely rose by nearly 3%," said Monteiro, who coined the term "ultraprocessed" in 2009 when he developed NOVA, a system of classifying foods into four groups by their level of processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group one of the NOVA system is unprocessed or minimally processed foods in their natural state, such as fruits, vegetables, meat, milk and eggs. Group two includes culinary ingredients such as salt, herbs and oils. Group three consists of processed foods that combine groups one and two — canned goods and frozen vegetables are examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group four includes ultraprocessed foods. By Monteiro's definition, ultraprocessed foods contain little to no whole foods. Instead, they are manufactured from "chemically manipulated cheap ingredients" and often use "synthetic additives to make them edible, palatable and habit-forming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No reason exists to believe that humans can fully adapt to these products," Monteiro cowrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj.q439" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2024 editorial&lt;/a&gt; in the journal The BMJ. "The body may react to them as useless or harmful, so its systems may become impaired or damaged, depending on their vulnerability and the amount of ultra-processed food consumed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;Demonizing convenient, affordable and shelf-ready food and beverage products could limit access to and cause avoidance of nutrient-dense foods.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Sarah Gallo, Consumer Brands Association&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study is misleading and will lead to consumer confusion, said Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of product policy for the Consumer Brands Association, which represents the food industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Demonizing convenient, affordable and shelf-ready food and beverage products could limit access to and cause avoidance of nutrient-dense foods," Gallo said in an email, "resulting in decreased diet quality, increased risk of food-borne illness and exacerbated health disparities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Just a serving a day matters, studies say&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is not the first to find an association between negative health outcomes and small increases in ultraprocessed food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-health-risks-study-wellness/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;February 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found "strong" evidence that people who ate more ultraprocessed food had a 50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease-related death and common mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher intake of ultraprocessed foods might also increase the risk of anxiety by up to 53%, obesity by 55%, sleep disorders by 41%, development of type 2 diabetes by 40% and the risk of depression or an early death from any cause by 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the February study defined a higher intake as one serving or about 10% more ultraprocessed foods per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A May 2024 study found that adding just 10% of ultraprocessed food to an otherwise healthy diet may also increase the risk of cognitive decline and stroke&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-stroke-cognitive-decline-wellness/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; while 2023 research determined that including 10% more ultraprocessed foods was linked to a greater chance of developing cancers of the upper digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's estimated that as much as 70% of the U.S. food supply is ultraprocessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Two-thirds of the calories children consume in the U.S. are ultraprocessed, while about 60% of adult diets are ultraprocessed," Fang Fang Zhang, associate professor and chair of the division of nutrition epidemiology and data science at Tufts University in Boston, told CNN &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-health-risks-study-wellness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;in an earlier interview&lt;/a&gt;. Zhang was not involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A global estimate of preventable deaths&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest study&lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00072-8/fulltext" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;, published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, took an additional step by estimating how many deaths might be prevented in eight countries with low, medium and high consumption of ultraprocessed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Premature preventable deaths due to the consumption of UPFs can vary from 4% in countries with lower UPF consumption to almost 14% in countries with the highest UPF consumption," lead study author Eduardo Augusto Fernandes Nilson, a researcher at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;(The study was unable to determine if the deaths were) caused by UPF consumption. The methods of this study simply cannot determine this.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;– Nerys Astbury,  University of Oxford&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's important to note that the study was unable to determine if the deaths were "caused by UPF consumption. The methods of this study simply cannot determine this," said nutrition scientist Nerys Astbury, an associate professor of diet and obesity at the UK's University of Oxford, in a statement. He was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has the highest level of ultraprocessed food consumption in the world — nearly 55% of the average American's diet, according to the study. Researchers estimated that reducing the use of those ultraprocessed foods to zero would have prevented over 124,000 deaths in the U.S. in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In countries where consumption of ultraprocessed foods is low, such as Colombia (15% of the diet) and Brazil (17.4%), reducing the use to zero would have prevented nearly 3,000 deaths in the former country in 2015 and 25,000 deaths in the latter in 2017, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;It is possible that the true causal risk factor is not ultraprocessed foods, but a related risk factor such as better physical fitness — and ultraprocessed foods is simply an innocent bystander.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;– Stephen Burgess, University of Cambridge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The authors set the theoretical minimal risk level to be 0. This implies a scenario where all UPFs are eliminated, which is highly unrealistic and nearly impossible in our current society," Zhang said in an email. "As a result, the estimated burden of pre-mature death due to UPFs could be overestimated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Burgess, a statistician in the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the UK's University of Cambridge, said that while the study cannot prove the consumption of ultraprocessed foods is harmful, "it does provide evidence linking consumption with poorer health outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is possible that the true causal risk factor is not ultraprocessed foods, but a related risk factor such as better physical fitness — and ultraprocessed foods is simply an innocent bystander," said Burgess, who was not involved in the study, in a statement. "But, when we see these associations replicated across many countries and cultures, it raises suspicion that ultraprocessed foods may be more than a bystander."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 18:18:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxQX2lsVnFSYzBlTnppZE5mWWNZSUhzZFh6SDZpbkJqRFlHUzZ5SFI4dVdqMUdwZjhBVW44aHpESHpubjhkSkNlTl9lemw5Y29mSF9kNUJodVd5V0NBRXN6UWYtd1Q5czZDR3h3T0dYTTc5OTZnU3oxWnVQOWxXa3dTbDNBYWVzcmxxaVluUlRDTjd1YVN5aTdyb3AwdU9GSUZpRDQxSXNtRko3NjU3QnFYTVlxaFl1ZUMtR25mbFpR</guid></item><item><title>您的肠道健康吗？警告标志和4种治疗方法- CNET | Is Your Gut Healthy?

Making changes to your diet or routine that may improve your gut, and your overall health is a good first step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to keep in mind that there's no exact standard for the perfectly healthy gut microbiome, Cresci said, since everyone's composition is so different. Bearing that in mind, here are four things you can do to help keep it on the right track. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="9b6a1bb6-9e58-4029-880a-000dc982ad63" data-ng-block="{"&gt;1. Eat these gut-friendly foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome prefers foods we can't digest. This includes foods with a lot of fiber, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts; foods we already know we should eat for their nutritional properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cresci, foods to remove from your gut, or eat in lower amounts, include foods high in sugar and fat and low in fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are all associated with the consumption of a Western diet, which is also associated with a disrupted microbiome," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond a gut-healthy diet, which not-so-coincidentally coincides with a &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/5-heart-healthy-foods-to-add-to-your-grocery-list-this-week/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, eating fermented foods can help replace the good microbes and their metabolites. Cresci lists yogurt, kombucha and kefir as examples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a1a52593-0492-4b02-b25c-5337ef955017" data-ng-block="{"&gt;2.

If you're prescribed an antibiotic or have recurring infections that have you taking antibiotics often, ask your doctor about what you can do to help minimize the disruption to your microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medications that can disrupt our microbiomes, Cresci says, include those that alter the PH of the stomach and take away acid. Examples include proton pump inhibitors, aka PPIs, and histamine H2-receptor antagonists, or H2 blockers, which are used to reduce acid reflux symptoms and might be available over the counter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By keeping track of the medications you're taking, you can help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms and (with sign-off from your doctor) take the appropriate steps or substitutions if gut health is an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="bbe18608-a9f3-4775-bf43-d4b9a249e9e3" data-ng-block="{"&gt;3. Find the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; probiotics or supplements &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to incorporating more yogurt or fermented foods into their diet, some people may &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/news/7-best-probiotics/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;seek a probiotic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in hopes of balancing their gut, as they're designed to &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/how-do-probiotics-improve-your-gut-health/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;mimic an intact microbiota&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If you're considering taking a supplement, including probiotics, Cresci told CNET it's important to know that probiotics are strain-specific, and "each strain has their own method of action." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some probiotics are designed to help people with antibiotic-induced diarrhea, but that won't work for a person taking it for bowel regularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want to take the one that has been studied for whatever it is your problem is," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, unfortunately, keep in mind that probiotics will not completely override what you eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have a bad diet, and you want to keep eating a bad diet but want to improve your microbiome, a probiotic isn't gonna help you," Cresci said. "You have to do the other part too." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains, fruits and vegetables are great food choices if you want to start healing your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;piotr_malczyk/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="e2dc1caf-230f-4659-934b-6774bb04f63c" data-ng-block="{"&gt;4.

If you dread running or don't have time to go to the gym, don't worry: There are &lt;a data-id="64e83ed3-36a3-4d1d-90a2-0454068dfb22" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/exercise-snacks-are-just-as-healthy-as-a-full-workout-heres-why/" target="_self"&gt;small ways&lt;/a&gt; you can get your body in the &lt;a target="_self" data-id="64e83ed3-36a3-4d1d-90a2-0454068dfb22" href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout"&gt;habit of moving every day&lt;/a&gt; or at least more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting good sleep is another general piece of wellness advice tied directly to the health of our guts. According to Cresci, our microbiome adheres to the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/sleep/internal-clock-out-of-whack-heres-how-to-reset-and-get-better-sleep/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; too. So if we're eating when our gut microbiome isn't ready, we won't be set up to properly process the nutrients of our food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacking sleep also triggers an increase in stress and cortisol, which have &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;negative mental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and physical impacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot going on with the gut-brain interaction, so that signals back to the microbiome, and vice versa," Cresci said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most fundamental is the fact that when we're exhausted, we don't have the energy to check off many of the things that keep us healthy, &lt;a data-id="0ea75d31-1af2-4481-9502-10377d44f3bd" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.637010/full#h11" target="_self"&gt;including exercising&lt;/a&gt; or finding a nutritious meal -- both of which impact our gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're sleepy, tired, exhausted, you tend not to do the things we know are good for microbiomes," Cresci said.

True, but so are eggs, pork loin and Brussels sprouts. That’s because they’re rich in choline, a nutrient related to B vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VWEUT74FNFGCXIWDZYLUCHLHSE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Choline is critically important for a variety of body and brain functions,” says Ramon Velazquez, an assistant professor at the Arizona State University-Banner Neurodegenerative Disease Research Center in Tempe. It’s part of all cell membranes, and in recent years there’s been increasing evidence linking it to &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/mental-health/boost-your-brainpower-at-any-age-a1999739192/"&gt;better cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; and even a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease. But about 90 percent of people don’t get enough of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="GNZCEQECOBH2BMVZCTENHJQQTU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="GNZCEQECOBH2BMVZCTENHJQQTU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The memory effect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DAF6AXK5QBB5PCV7RVDTJB2TIE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The brain needs choline to make acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. “These [neurotransmitters] are chemicals that build and connect neurons [nerve cells] in the brain and body, and allow them to communicate with each other,” says Thomas B. Shea, a professor of biological sciences at UMass Lowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NAL4REGZLBF5PC35NFYD56S3HE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Research has found that levels of acetylcholine naturally decline with age and that people with Alzheimer’s disease have lower-than-normal levels. “The connection is seen both in age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s,” Velazquez says. “Lower levels of acetylcholine may affect your ability to form and recall memories, as well as affect word recall and focus.” A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8570899/"&gt;2021 study published in Behavioral Neurology&lt;/a&gt; found that people who got 188 to 400 mg per day of choline had a 40 percent reduced risk of experiencing low cognitive function than those who got less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4TN66PRMGBHARFXGAHNYJ72HJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some research suggests that specific types of choline may be more beneficial than others. For example, in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522013375?via%3Dihub"&gt;2019 study involving almost 500 men, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, every 50 mg intake per day of phosphatidylcholine was linked to a 10 percent decrease in dementia risk. Eggs were the main source of it in the men’s diet. A large egg has 169 mg of choline, about 70 percent of which is phosphatidylcholine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4CSLFF23WJBCBHVB7B74BBEIVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There’s even the potential that increasing choline intake after an Alzheimer’s diagnosis may help. “In studies of people with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease,” Velazquez says, “we’ve seen that supplementing with choline may slow the progression of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6M4OQNPZNZBDDORIQVSQKNG6XE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are other benefits to making sure that your diet contains plenty of choline. It plays a role in both fat and glucose metabolism. “Not getting enough choline can increase the risk of fatty liver disease, Type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases,” Velazquez says. Adequate choline may also protect against heart disease and strokes by helping to control the inflammation that contributes to those conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="O6V6JZGXMVB3ND22P7O4WBWW2M" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="O6V6JZGXMVB3ND22P7O4WBWW2M" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How much choline do you need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GD3S6BP5KJFNBOGPVZII5POLBY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Your body produces some choline, but it’s nowhere near enough to perform all of these critical functions,” Velazquez says. The Daily Value for choline is 550 mg, and that needs to come from food or supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3V2VNMOEBJC6BNGJ2PBCKUIUPE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s not hard to get the choline you need through diet,” Shea says. Many foods contain at least some, and there are several that provide substantial amounts (see below). “But sometimes older adults start eating fewer calories or less variety of foods. In that case, supplementation may be in order.” Supplements can also be a good idea for people who eat a mostly plant-based diet because many of the foods highest in choline are animal products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZWX5G7P2R5H7LHX2BU533KCJAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You might not be able to rely on a multivitamin to help meet your choline needs, though; some brands contain little to none of the nutrient. If you’re going to take a supplement, Shea recommends choosing one that has about 300 mg. As with any supplement, you should discuss it with your doctor beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="CNH5AYZILJB6NLVKDYZATXQF7M" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="CNH5AYZILJB6NLVKDYZATXQF7M" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Top sources of choline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KY6JF7K2EVEMPDPM7KYEKVOXGU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You can find choline in a variety of foods, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="NZEOLVL3TZHRLDVU75FK4MGYXA" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beef liver, 3.5 oz.

            As of 18 April 2025, a total of 2318 measles cases, including three deaths, have been confirmed in six countries in the WHO Region of the Americas, an 11-fold increase compared to the same period in 2024. The majority of cases have occurred among people between 1 to 29 years, who are either unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. Additionally, most cases are imported or linked to importation. Measles is a highly contagious, airborne viral disease that can lead to severe complications and death. Although it is preventable with two doses of the vaccine, over 22 million children worldwide did not receive their first dose of the vaccine in 2023. This has contributed to a global rise in measles cases in 2024, which heightens the risk of imported infections, particularly from unvaccinated travellers arriving from areas where the virus is actively circulating.
WHO is working closely with countries in the WHO Region of the Americas to prevent the spread and reintroduction of measles. The regional risk is currently assessed as high, while the global risk remains moderate.
        &lt;/p&gt;

Of these, three cases were imported, 13 were identified as contacts linked to the imported cases, and five cases are still under investigation to determine their epidemiological link to the transmission chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The index case was reported on 31 January 2025, in a child with a history of international travel. The second case, another child and a contact of the index case, was reported on 3 February 2025. Neither of the two cases had a history of measles vaccination, and both were laboratory-confirmed by RT-PCR. Following these initial cases, 19 additional cases were confirmed up to 16 April, with ages ranging from 5 months to 40 years. Two of these cases had a documented history of international travel. Only two cases required hospitalization due to pneumonia; the remaining cases were managed on an outpatient basis and are recovering well. Twelve of the cases were confirmed at the National Reference Laboratory of INEI-ANLIS "Carlos G. Malbrán," with genotype B3 identified. One of the imported cases, associated with recent international travel to Thailand, was identified as genotype D8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 12 April 2025, the Belize Ministry of Health &amp;amp; Wellness confirmed two positive measles cases—Belize’s first since 1991. The cases involved 17-year-old males from the Corozal and Cayo districts with no vaccination history, who travelled to Chihuahua, México, from 5 January to 31 March 2025 to attend a religious gathering. The onset of symptoms occurred on 2 April and 3 April 2025. Blood samples and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for both cases and confirmed positive for measles on 12 April 2025. Thirteen close contacts who attended the religious gathering in Chihuahua were interviewed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) team and monitored daily for signs and symptoms. Despite significant efforts to increase vaccination coverage, Belize remains below the target range of 92-95%.  In 2024, Belize reported a country percentage of 83.9% for the second dose of the MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brazil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1 January and 18 April 2025, Brazil reported five confirmed cases of measles across four locations: Federal District (1), Rio de Janeiro (2), Rio Grande do Sul (1), and São Paulo (1). The two cases in Rio de Janeiro are children under one year of age, both without a history of vaccination. The onset of symptoms was on 28 February and 2 March, 2025. The cases in the Federal District (symptom onset 1 March 2025) and Rio Grande do Sul (symptom onset 6 April 2025) are adults with a history of international travel. Additionally, an adult case reported in São Paulo who has a history of vaccination, and no history of international travel was reported with symptom onset on 4 April 2025. The source of infection for this case is currently under investigation.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canada&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1 January and 12 April 2025, Canada reported 1069 confirmed and probable cases of measles from seven provinces: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. These far exceed the 177 confirmed and probable cases reported in 2024, representing the highest annual case count since the country achieved measles elimination in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority (83%) of the cases reported in 2025 are linked to a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak occurring among unvaccinated individuals in under-vaccinated communities that sometimes interact with one another.  Between 27 October 2024 and 12 April 2025, 971 cases have been reported in seven provinces. The outbreak was initiated by an internationally imported case that attended a large gathering in New Brunswick in October 2024, which included attendees from multiple provinces. Most cases associated with this outbreak are either unvaccinated (84%) or have unknown vaccination status (12%). To date, only a small number of outbreak-associated cases have occurred outside the initially affected under-vaccinated communities, with no evidence of significant further spread beyond these communities.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, between 1 January and 12 April 2025, small numbers of localized outbreaks have been reported, consisting of two or more epidemiologically and/or virologically linked cases. These outbreaks are distinct from the multi-jurisdictional outbreak described above and have been directly related to internationally imported cases. During this same period, 16 measles cases in Canada have been attributed to international travel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mexico&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1 January and 16 April 2025, Mexico confirmed 421 measles cases: two imported, 35 import-related, and 384 under investigation. Cases were reported in Campeche (n= 4), Chihuahua (n= 403, including one death), Oaxaca (n= 4), Querétaro (n= 1), Sinaloa (n= 1), Sonora (n= 5), Tamaulipas (n= 2) and Zacatecas (n= 1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first confirmed case is an unvaccinated child in Oaxaca with a history of international travel between October 2024 and January 2025. The child arrived in Mexico on 29 January and developed symptoms on 10 February. On 14 February, the Oaxaca State Public Health Laboratory reported positive RT-PCR and IgM results for measles with genotype B3 identified. Three related cases were later confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 20 February, the second confirmed case was reported in the State of Chihuahua in an unvaccinated child. The onset of symptoms was on 11 February, and measles was confirmed by the Chihuahua State Public Health Laboratory with positive RT-PCR and IgM results. The identified genotype was D8.  Following contact tracing and active case searches, 419 additional cases were identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of cases were among those aged 25–44 years, accounting for 34.4% (n= 145), followed by children aged 5–9 years (13,5%, n= 57). In terms of vaccination history, 92.4% (n= 389) had no vaccination history, while 3.8% (n=16) had received one dose of the MMR vaccine, and another 3.8% (n=16) had received two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United States of America&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 17 April 2025, a total of 800 confirmed measles cases were reported by 25 jurisdictions: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York State, New York City, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas (including two confirmed deaths), Vermont, and Washington. Of the total cases, 93% (n= 751) are associated with outbreaks (defined as three or more cases), with ten outbreaks identified so far this year. The outbreak in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma accounts for 82% of the reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children under the age of five accounted for 31% (n=249) of cases, individuals aged 5–19 for 38% (n=304), adults over 20 for 29% (n=231), and age was unknown for 2 % (n=16). The vast majority (96%) of the cases were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, 1% had a single dose of the MMR vaccine, and 2% had received two doses. Hospitalization was required in 11% of total cases (n=85 of 800). Among children under five, 19% (47 of 249) required hospitalization. MMR vaccination coverage in children has decreased in recent years from 95.2% in 2019-2020 to 92.7% in 2023-2024.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious acute viral disease that affects individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children worldwide. The disease is airborne, transmitted through the air or via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10-14 days after infection, include high fever, rash usually accompanied by a runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough and tiny white spots inside the mouth. The rash appears 2-4 days after the onset of fever and spreads from the head to the trunk to the lower extremities. A person is infectious about four days before and up to four days after the rash appears. While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, most people recover within 2-3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is usually a mild or moderately severe disease. However, measles can lead to complications such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, secondary ear infection, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), blindness, and death. Postinfectious encephalitis can occur approximately in about one in every 1000 infected persons. Measles also produces immune amnesia; a pathological process that makes the immune system forget how to protect against infections and leaves the infected individual more vulnerable to other infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines available. A two-dose schedule is 97% effective in preventing measles for life. &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the declaration of measles elimination in the Americas Region in 2016, there was an unusual and consistent increase in confirmed cases of the disease from 2017 to 2019. In 2019, the region recorded its highest incidence rate at 21.5 cases per million population. This increase was largely due to large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil, which led to the reestablishment of endemic measles transmission and the loss of elimination status in these countries.  Between 2018 and 2023, the Americas Region reported 49 187 confirmed cases in 18 countries, resulting from the importation of viruses from other regions of the world and the resurgence of endemic transmission in Venezuela and Brazil.  The last endemic case of measles in the Americas Region was reported by Brazil in June 2022. By 2024, 465 confirmed cases were registered, all either imported or related to importation. That same year, the elimination of the endemic disease in the Americas Region was reverified.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the WHO Region of the Americas, in 2025, there is an 11-fold increase in the number of cases compared to the same period in 2024. Although an improvement has been achieved in measles rubella surveillance indicators, there are still countries that do not meet the minimum notification rate of two suspected cases per 100 000 population, in addition to other indicators, in a homogeneous way. This could delay detection, notification, confirmation, and rapid response actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Difficulty in maintaining adequate levels of vaccination in the migrant population, vaccine-hesitant groups and other at-risk populations within the Region are big challenges. Given that several countries in Europe, Central Asia and Africa have areas of circulation of the virus, the identification of imported cases from these areas is expected. Intense migration from areas where the disease is endemic to areas where it is not could increase the risk of new outbreaks and cases. Considering population movement, international travel and mass gathering events, the risk of international spread cannot be ruled out. Travellers from regions with ongoing outbreaks can introduce the virus into countries with higher vaccination coverage, where there are still vulnerable populations, particularly infants who may not yet have received their first dose of the measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The overall risk of measles in the Americas Region is considered high due to several factors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Ongoing virus circulation from      imported cases has led to outbreaks with extended transmission chains,      secondary cases, and virus spread to new areas and countries in 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Suboptimal vaccination coverage      persists across the region. In 2023, only 28.6% of countries achieved over      95% coverage for the first MMR dose (MMR1), and just 16.7% for the second      dose (MMR2). Regional coverage was 87% for MMR1 and 76% for MMR2. Data for      2024 is still being consolidated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;An increasing number of susceptible      individuals due to continued low coverage, driven by factors like the      COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine hesitancy, and limited access to healthcare,      especially among vulnerable groups such as migrants, displaced persons,      and Indigenous populations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall risk of this event in the WHO Region of the Americas, especially in countries with low vaccination coverage, is classified as high with a high confidence level based on available information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall risk at the global level is assessed as moderate due to the ongoing transmission in all the other WHO Regions, where immunization programs in several countries are not at an optimal level due to various factors, such as resource limitations, vaccine hesitancy, political instability, and health system weaknesses. These challenges have resulted in gaps in vaccination coverage, leading to widening pockets of the unvaccinated population and creating a pathway for measles to spread. This not only poses a public health concern for affected countries but also represents a potential risk for other regions due to international travel and population movement. The global risk of transmission remains a threat and particularly in areas with moderate or low vaccine coverage and could lead to new outbreaks in an unvaccinated population. This risk, coupled with gaps in laboratory systems and surveillance, outbreak detection and rapid response capacity, impedes progress towards global measles elimination goals and further exacerbates the threat of spread.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WHO recommends maintaining sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95% with the first and second doses of the measles-containing vaccine (MCV) and strengthening integrated epidemiological surveillance of measles and rubella to achieve timely detection of all suspected cases in public and private healthcare facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends strengthening epidemiological surveillance and preparedness and rapid response capacities in high-traffic border areas to rapidly detect and respond to suspected measles cases. Providing a rapid response to imported measles cases to avoid the re-establishment of endemic transmission through the activation of rapid response teams trained for this purpose and by implementing rapid response protocols when there are imported cases. Once a rapid response team has been activated, continued coordination between the national, sub-national and local levels must be ensured, with continuous and effective communication channels across all levels. During outbreaks, it is recommended to establish adequate hospital case management and infection prevention and control capacity to avoid health care-associated infection transmission, with appropriate referral of patients to airborne infection isolation rooms (for any level of care) and avoiding contact with other patients in waiting rooms and/or other hospital rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends providing broad access to measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) or measles and rubella (MR) vaccination to maintain high vaccination rates of the general population and to ensure individuals at high risk of exposure are up to date on this vaccination, such as health and care personnel and international travellers. Individuals living in outbreak areas should follow local public health guidance. Globally, between 2000 and 2023, vaccination successfully prevented an estimated 60 million deaths (6 million deaths in the Americas) and decreased an estimated measles death from 800 062 in 2000 to 107 500 in 2023, which is an 87% decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends maintaining a stock of the MR and/or MMR vaccines, and syringes/supplies for responding to imported cases. Facilitating access to vaccination services according to the national scheme to incoming and outgoing international travellers, including individuals due to perform activities, domestically or abroad, in areas with ongoing measles outbreaks, displaced populations, indigenous populations, or other vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO advises international travellers to check and update their vaccination status against measles prior to departure. Unvaccinated individuals from areas experiencing measles outbreaks, with knowledge of exposure to measles cases and/or presenting signs and symptoms compatible with measles virus infection, should consult local health authorities before undertaking an international voyage. At present, no additional measures that significantly interfere with international traffic are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Tick season is upon New England — and some unexpected visitors have come up north to join the usual crew, one study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A University of Massachusetts Amherst center has found and studied two ticks in Maine that are capable of infecting people with rare, possibly fatal, sicknesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New England Center of Excellence of Vector-borne Diseases, led by UMass Amherst microbiology professor Stephen Rich, scans residential backyards in New England as a part of an ongoing study in its third year to develop better practices for tick control, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/news/article/umass-amherst-tick-researchers-identify-new-strain-rickettsia-bacteria-causes-spotted"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In one of the sets of properties that we looked at in Maine, we found some rather extraordinary ticks that we don’t usually see,” Rich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The usual ticks found in the Northeast are deer, dog, and human ticks that often carry Lyme disease. In this survey, which catches ticks by placing down a white cloth and then extracting them, researchers found a “preponderous” amount of uncommon rabbit ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, some of these ticks carried a unique, rare microbe called Rickettsia similar to a strain found in California that has led to people contracting potentially fatal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/about/index.html"&gt;Rocky Mountain spotted fever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich said that rabbit ticks don’t often feed on humans, but a likely scenario is that a more common tick feeds on an infected rabbit that can then transmit to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a low risk factor, but it is something that we didn’t know about until now, and it’s something we want to understand a little bit better and make sure that it is infrequent, and that it’s not something that has the potential to bridge over,” Rich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second case found does not cause disease, but rather an allergy — to red meat. Alpha-gal syndrome is becoming increasingly common in areas where the Lone Star tick, the usual culprit, is established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this year, alpha-gal syndrome has been found in &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/4/24-1265_article#:~:text=Maine%20CDC%20received%20positive%20%CE%B1,were%20%3E65%20years%20of%20age."&gt;57 residents in Maine&lt;/a&gt;, whose climate is not typical for the Lone Star tick. The allergy was recently found to have been linked to the black-legged tick after a woman reported being bitten by one and then developing an intolerance to red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding of not a tick but a patient that had alpha-gal … was what made that finding quite notable,” Rich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich said the most effective way to avoid tick bites is to treat clothing with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553150"&gt;permethrin&lt;/a&gt;, a chemical that can kill ticks and other arthropods within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a tick does bite, the time it takes for it to infect a person differs from case to case, but Rich said the average time for Lyme disease to enter a person’s body is 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you take the tick off earlier, you can greatly reduce the risk of exposure from the stuff inside that tick,” Rich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich said the finding of both of these “relatively rare events” within the same time period is likely due to there being more surveillance — the team is able to look “more carefully than we did in the past,” thanks to the study, which received &lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/news/article/cdc-designates-new-england-center-excellence-vector-borne-diseases-umass-amherst"&gt;$10 million&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re doing the testing to provide impactful information to homeowners,” Rich said. “Because we’re doing that, and that wasn’t taking place before, we’re bound to make new discoveries of this kind.”&lt;/p&gt;

Those adding a little bit of&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/food-and-drink/cinnamon-products-lead-consumer-reports-b2614447.html"&gt; cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; to their sugar or hot beverage of choice aren't likely to have any issues, but consuming the spice in high doses could &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/health-and-wellbeing/gemma-collins-mounjaro-wegovy-ozempic-b2737810.html"&gt;cause complications&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Health concerns could arise if excessive amounts of supplements are consumed without the knowledge of health care provider or prescriber of the medications,” Shabana Khan, a principal scientist involved in the study, said. “Overconsumption of supplements could lead to a rapid clearance of the prescription medicine from the body, and that could result in making the medicine less effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary compound in cinnamon, cinnamaldehyde, can activate receptors in the body that actually breaks down certain medicines, researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also noted in the study that cinnamon oil — typically used in cooking and for toiletries — poses no risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is not the same for cinnamon bark. The study found that bark, especially that of Cassia cinnamon, a cheaper Chinese version of the spice, have the potential to cause medicine-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 kSitga"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/18/newFile-1.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/18/newFile-1.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/18/newFile-1.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="New research out of the University of Mississippi found that ingesting high doses of cinnamon could lower the efficacy of some prescription medications" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-27372"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;New research out of the University of Mississippi found that ingesting high doses of cinnamon could lower the efficacy of some prescription medications&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Getty Images/iStockphoto)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“True cinnamon from Sri Lanka carries a lower risk due to its reduced coumarin content,” the study's co-author Amar Chittiboyina, associate director of the National Center for Natural Products Research, said. “Coumarin’s anticoagulant properties can be hazardous for individuals on blood thinners.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon typically carried in grocery stores is generally made of Cassia cinnamon bark, according to the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/27/health/popular-spice-could-interfere-with-prescription-drugs-study/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone consumes a significant amount of cinnamon regularly or has concerns about their cinnamon intake, they should speak to their doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khan said that anyone relying on medications to stay healthy should check with their doctors before taking supplements that could interact negatively with their treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who suffer from chronic diseases — like hypertension, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, asthma, obesity, HIV, AIDS or depression — should be cautious when using cinnamon or any other supplements," Khan said. “Our best advice is to talk to a health care provider before using any supplements along with the prescription medicine. By definition, supplements are not meant to treat, cure or mitigate any disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 17:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOZmozaGtyRzI2ZGhKbG16U0xmSHhrRW1pZjFjQzZDMW1uTEQ0YllkNVFfOE92SXNNUVhXcXFOT1gwM3lGdnJnaXh3VkdkMlZ2Vk5GWjFJX1FIa1F0ZW00ZkFsWktRQmxTbjdRZ285MlpjNEx0em5ldndENWdVdFZLTmhwSG9NZHhVTFJyY3Z6eTZxMzV6S0NCUmhBM3pwbHhSMDd3SjlGVTBEd0JSclJJ</guid></item><item><title>三名年轻女性在示巴医疗中心企图自杀，家人声称疏忽- Ynetnews | Three young women attempt suicide at Sheba Medical Center, families allege negligence - Ynetnews</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE45T0JVN3BYXzF3UjNQQ0dnbmNuem1peHBzM3JqOE9Qcm5IcU9MaERuOGYxWnVBMW8zU2NvVS1heDhIRzN0VnBsdVJ2RFdjUmRFWk55MVB0VExtUm1PakNfQWhQMTVqU2NaT1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="ArticleHeaderComponent" class="ArticleHeaderEngComponent1280 selectableShareable for-print" role="header" aria-label="article header"&gt;&lt;p class="mainTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h1 class="mainTitle"&gt;Three young women attempt suicide at Sheba Medical Center, families allege negligence&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="subTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span disabled class="subTitle" contenteditable="false"&gt;Patients in their 20s hospitalized in open psychiatric ward survive suicide attempts, all within 48 hours of each other, prompting allegations of negligence from families and leading the hospital to close the ward and launch an internal investigation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 16:39:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE45T0JVN3BYXzF3UjNQQ0dnbmNuem1peHBzM3JqOE9Qcm5IcU9MaERuOGYxWnVBMW8zU2NvVS1heDhIRzN0VnBsdVJ2RFdjUmRFWk55MVB0VExtUm1PakNfQWhQMTVqU2NaT1E</guid></item><item><title>格鲁吉亚男子因涉嫌在妻子去世前向其隐瞒HIV阳性状况而面临谋杀指控- AOL.com | Georgia Man Facing Murder Charges After Allegedly Concealing HIV-Positive Status from Wife Before Her Death - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTFBNQ1JCSmdhWlNnclZ6Uzl0akZMdDdFQmMtaFNuamZEVTFONm5PM05DVmM4UWtYUEQ1YnVVZ1l6bHlkWU1UZGgyMGFSeU1XOVhLdmYtbHNjNDBSakFJcml4eEJ0ZXlCMFo5WWFMaFJjOXdhWmpBVHZJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlanta News First &lt;/p&gt; Cleveland Broadie&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Georgia man was indicted by a grand jury on murder charges as prosecutors and family claim he did not disclose his HIV-positive status to his wife Denise, who was a cancer survivor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Denise died in 2022, days after she was diagnosed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"At any time, he could have told her and given her the right to make the decision to stay with him," Denise's daughter said&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Georgia man is now facing murder charges as prosecutors and loved ones claim he intentionally did not disclose his HIV-positive status to his wife, a cancer survivor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, April 21, Cleveland Broadie of Rockdale County was indicted by a grand jury on charges of malice murder and felony murder in connection with the 2022 death of his wife, Denise Broadie, according to CBS affiliate &lt;a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2025/04/22/murder-charges-filed-against-hiv-positive-metro-atlanta-man/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Atlanta News First;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Atlanta News First&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denise, who was 65, died two days after she was diagnosed with AIDS, according to both Atlanta News First and &lt;a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/rockdale-county-man-charged-murder-accused-infecting-wife-aids" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fox 5 Atlanta;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Fox 5 Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, as prosecutors allege it was a result of Cleveland's “reckless conduct.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleveland has already pleaded not guilty to the reckless conduct charges. He has not entered a plea for the malice and felony murder charges, per Atlanta News First.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair wed in 2014, three years before Denise was diagnosed with breast cancer for the first time in 2017, according to both outlets. After she went into remission, the cancer returned in 2019, per Atlanta News First. The cancer eventually cleared once again following years of treatment, but Denise remained sick — with new tests ultimately leading to a 2022 AIDS diagnosis shortly before her death on April 2, 2022, according to Fox 5 Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/hiv-transmission-via-cosmetic-injections-vampire-facial-cdc-report-8639524" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC Reports First Investigation of HIV Transmission via Cosmetic Injections;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC Reports First Investigation of HIV Transmission via Cosmetic Injections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlanta News First &lt;/p&gt; Denise Broadie&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleveland, now 62, was later charged with three counts of reckless conduct in 2023, after other women came forward, with investigators claiming at the time that he was aware of his HIV-positive status and had been taking medication for it since 2006, per a previous report from &lt;a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2023/07/19/man-charged-with-felony-reckless-conduct-not-disclosing-hiv-status/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Atlanta News First;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Atlanta News First&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Cleveland's initial charges, Denise's family continued to push forward with an investigation, as Fox 5 Atlanta notes, by hiring private investigators to look into his past and prove he was aware of his HIV-positive status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per Rockdale County Jail's online records, Cleveland was initially arrested in July 2023 and booked again on April 16 of this year over the new arrest warrant/indictment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karen Young, Denise's daughter who described her mom as a family matriarch with a heart of gold, told Fox 5 Atlanta that she believes there was "malice" in Cleveland's actions. "At any time, he could have told her and given her the right to make the decision to stay with him," she said.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sydney scientists have revealed why receiving a booster vaccine in the same arm as your first dose can generate a more effective immune response more quickly. The study, led by the Garvan Institute of Medical Research and the Kirby Institute at UNSW Sydney and &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00407-6" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Cell&lt;/i&gt;, offers new insight that could help improve future vaccination strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that when a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vaccine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is administered, specialized immune cells called macrophages became "primed" inside lymph nodes. These macrophages then direct the positioning of memory B cells to more effectively respond to the booster when given in the same arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, made in mice and validated in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+participants/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human participants&lt;/a&gt;, provide evidence to refine vaccination approaches and offer a promising new approach for enhancing vaccine effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a fundamental discovery in how the immune system organizes itself to respond better to external threats—nature has come up with this brilliant system and we're just now beginning to understand it," says Professor Tri Phan, Director of the Precision Immunology Program at Garvan and co-senior author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientia Professor Anthony Kelleher, Director of the Kirby Institute and co-senior author says, "A unique and elegant aspect of this study is the team's ability to understand the rapid generation of effective vaccine responses. We did this by dissecting the complex biology in mice and then showed similar findings in humans. All this was done at the site of the generation of the vaccine response, the lymph node."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How vaccination site matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunization introduces a harmless version of a pathogen, known as a vaccine antigen, into the body, which is filtered through lymph nodes—immune 'training camps' that train the body to fight off the real pathogen. The researchers previously discovered that memory B cells, which are crucial for generating &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/antibody+responses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antibody responses&lt;/a&gt; when infections return, linger in the lymph node closest to the injection site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using state-of-the-art intravital imaging at Garvan, the team discovered that memory B cells migrate to the outer layer of the local lymph node, where they interact closely with the macrophages that reside there. When a booster was given in the same location, these 'primed' macrophages—already on alert—efficiently captured the antigen and activated the memory B cells to make high-quality antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Macrophages are known to gobble up pathogens and clear away dead cells, but our research suggests the ones in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lymph+nodes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lymph nodes&lt;/a&gt; closest to the injection site also play a central role in orchestrating an effective vaccine response the next time around. So location does matter," says Dr. Rama Dhenni, the study's co-first author, who undertook the research as part of his Scientia Ph.D. program at Garvan.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Clinical study validates findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the relevance of the animal results to human vaccines, the team at the Kirby Institute conducted a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+study/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical study&lt;/a&gt; with 30 volunteers receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Twenty participants received their booster dose in the same arm as their first dose, while 10 had their second shot in the opposite arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Those who received both doses in the same arm produced neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 significantly faster—within the first week after the second dose," says Alexandra Carey-Hoppé, co-first author and Ph.D. student from the Kirby Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These antibodies from the same arm group were also more effective against variants like delta and omicron. By four weeks, both groups had similar antibody levels, but that early protection could be crucial during an outbreak," says Dr. Mee Ling Munier, co-senior author and Vaccine Immunogenomics group leader at the Kirby Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you've had your COVID jabs in different arms, don't worry—our research shows that over time the difference in protection diminishes. But during a pandemic, those first weeks of protection could make an enormous difference at a population level. The same-arm strategy could help achieve herd immunity faster—particularly important for rapidly mutating viruses where speed of response matters."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the potential to refine vaccination guidelines, the findings offer a promising avenue for enhancing the effectiveness of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we can understand how to replicate or enhance the interactions between memory B cells and these macrophages, we may be able to design next-generation vaccines that require fewer boosters," says Professor Phan.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the University of California, Los Angeles, identified that comorbidities in midlife are associated with an increased risk of developing cancer and cancer-related mortality, with associations varying by cancer type. Chronic conditions were linked to higher cancer risks, offering insights that may inform prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Cross-disease communication, in which the diagnosis of one chronic condition accelerates the risk of a different subsequent disease, is receiving increasing attention. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that cardiac events such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+failure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt; and myocardial infarction can stimulate &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor+growth/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tumor growth&lt;/a&gt; and metastasis in mouse models of intestinal and breast cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical studies show that individuals diagnosed with heart failure or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/myocardial+infarction/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;myocardial infarction&lt;/a&gt; face an increased risk of developing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; compared with individuals without these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screening bias remains a concern, as individuals diagnosed with cardiac conditions may undergo more frequent medical evaluations, leading to earlier detection of cancer. Broader evaluations across a range of comorbidities classified systematically are needed to confirm associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Comorbidity in Midlife and Cancer Outcomes," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2832233" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;, researchers performed a secondary analysis of the prospective Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) screening trial to investigate how midlife comorbidities affect future cancer risk and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;A cohort of 128,999 adults aged 55 to 74 years was enrolled between 1993 and 2001 at 10 PLCO screening centers across the United States. Participants self-reported histories of 12 comorbid conditions, classified into five categories guided by World Health Organization taxonomy: cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, liver-related, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolic+conditions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metabolic conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a median follow-up of 20 years, only respiratory (HR 1.07, 95 % CI 1.02–1.12) and cardiovascular (HR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.00–1.05) histories were associated with a statistically significant increase in overall cancer incidence. Metabolic, GI and liver conditions did not raise the pan-cancer risk, although each was strongly linked, positively or negatively, to several specific cancer types. Each comorbid condition was associated with an increased risk of at least one cancer type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver conditions had the strongest association with future liver cancer (HR, 5.57; 95% CI, 4.03–7.71). Metabolic conditions were linked to higher risk of nine cancer types and lower risk of four types, including lung and prostate cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiratory conditions (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.11–1.28), cardiovascular conditions (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04–1.13), and metabolic conditions (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05–1.14) were associated with increased cancer-specific mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings indicate that midlife comorbidities influence cancer development and mortality risk. Public health strategies focused on early screening and management of chronic conditions may help improve cancer prevention and outcomes. Formal integration of comorbidity screening into routine cancer risk assessments could support more personalized cancer prevention programs.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KENTUCKY, USA — Two cities in Kentucky are among the top 100 U.S. cities with the highest rates of Sexually Transmitted Illnesses (STI) this year, according to a recent study.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City of Lexington has the highest rate of STIs in Kentucky, ranking 24th overall in the country, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.innerbody.com/std-testing/std-statistics#rounding-out-the-top-100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;study by Innerbody.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lexington had 1,169 STI cases per 100,000 residents, 2,919 Chlamydia cases, 1,622 Gonorrhea cases, 223 Syphilis cases and 109 HIV cases, according to numbers from the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) latest STI Surveillance Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Lexington had the highest rate of STIs in Kentucky, another city in the Bluegrass State had more cases overall.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other Kentucky city to make the list of the top 100 U.S. cities with the highest rates of STIs was Louisville, known for hosting the Kentucky Derby every year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisville ranked 59th with 819 cases per 100,000 residents, 7,462 Chlamydia cases, 3,328 Gonorrhea cases, 313 Syphilis cases and 216 HIV cases.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities in the U.S. South account for over 60% of the top 25 metropolitan areas with the highest STI rates in this year's study, with Louisiana home to three of the 25 cities with the highest STI rates and Florida home to two cities in the top 25.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Wednesday, a team of English surgeons and attendants arrived in the city of Leicester to be briefed on an upcoming surgery never before attempted or imagined in the history of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their patient was Vanellope Wilkins, the solitary survivor known to British medicine of ectopia cordis, a condition where a fetus develops with its heart outside its body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a period of 9 hours, the team which included visiting surgeons from London would form a protective cage around Vanellope’s heart by reforming her ribs, and though her team included some of the best pediatric surgeons in the country, the procedure had never been done before, and was invented specifically for Vanellope’s case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in November 2017, the child had to be kept in intensive neonatal care for the first 14 months of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requiring a large about of medical supervision, she is both autistic and nonverbal. Graphic imagery obtained by the BBC &lt;a href="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/774a/live/3188ea70-1b9c-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg.webp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; Vanellope—her heart exposed in the center of her chest after it got caught and then fused onto her skin during development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ectopia cordis occurs in just a few babies per million births and has a low survival rate, and Vanellope required surgery immediately upon entering the world, a process which itself required 50 people to oversee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_217371" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-217371" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-217371" src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Miracle-baby-girl-Vanellope-Hope-Wilkins-SWNS.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Miracle-baby-girl-Vanellope-Hope-Wilkins-SWNS.jpg 762w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Miracle-baby-girl-Vanellope-Hope-Wilkins-SWNS-326x305.jpg 326w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Miracle-baby-girl-Vanellope-Hope-Wilkins-SWNS-696x651.jpg 696w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Miracle-baby-girl-Vanellope-Hope-Wilkins-SWNS-449x420.jpg 449w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Miracle-baby-girl-Vanellope-Hope-Wilkins-SWNS-530x496.jpg 530w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-217371" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;SWNS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consultant pediatric surgeon Nitin Patwardhan was there when it happened, and was one of the surgeons who recently stitched Vanellope’s heart back behind her chest bone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’d lie if I say I don’t get nervous,” Dr. Patwardhan told the BBC on the morning of the surgery. “But having been in this profession for so many years, you actually look forward to it because at the end of the day, you’re doing something that will change somebody’s life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A handful of children in the US have also survived this condition, and now at 7 years of age, Vanellope has been deemed suitable for a permanent solution to her unique medical hazard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE INCREDIBLE MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="British Woman Gives Birth After Receiving Transplant Womb from Sister and Pro Bono Surgery at Hospital" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/british-woman-gives-birth-after-receiving-transplant-womb-from-sister-and-pro-bono-surgery-at-hospital/" rel="bookmark"&gt;British Woman Gives Birth After Receiving Transplant Womb from Sister and Pro Bono Surgery at Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Placed on a bypass machine, Dr. Patwardhan and his team detached her right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary artery from where they were attached to the skin, before breaking her ribs and reforming them in a protective cage around the heart’s new location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sense of history and anticipation was present in the theater before and during the procedure, BBC reports. The operation was a success, and when the team was allowed to retire from the day’s work, they dubbed Vanellope “one of a kind,” in the truest sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE INFANT SURVIVORS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Baby Thriving After Doctors Removed Womb for Spinal Surgery–Then Put it Back Inside Mom at 26 Weeks" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/baby-thriving-after-doctors-removed-womb-for-spinal-surgery-then-put-it-back-inside-mom/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Baby Thriving After Doctors Removed Womb for Spinal Surgery–Then Put it Back Inside Mom at 26 Weeks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The best satisfaction we derive from this is when you get a text message from the mom to say ‘thank you, you guys are amazing’,” Ikenna Omeje, another of the surgical team who also operated on Vanellope when she was born, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62gll2j86ro" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told the BBC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think personally, I have just done my job, but it has made a difference to someone and that is very satisfying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naomi Findlay, Vanellope’s mother, says that in the past, bringing her into the hospital has always been a frightful episode, but now, with her daughter recovering in the pediatric intensive care unit, she’s become quietly confidant, and can’t wait to take her back home to see her brothers and younger sister.&lt;/p&gt;

Groth said on Monday that Cole is expected to spend “at least a couple of months” in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, where he will be fed intravenously due to complications with his intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every day gives us a bit more hope, so hopefully that continues,” Groth said. “You just never know, he could have a setback anyday… The surgeon [told us] we have to hope for some ‘boring days’ ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cole was born March 31 at New York-Presbyterian/Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital, with congenital cardiac issues. Doctors in the NICU placed a stent in Cole’s heart, after which the infant was considered “one of the healthiest babies on the floor,” his dad wrote in &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-cole-jordan-groths-fight-for-life"&gt;a GoFundMe appeal&lt;/a&gt;. At 11 p.m. on April 14, two days before Cole’s scheduled discharge, medical staff asked Tim and wife Gabrielle – Cole’s mom – if they wanted their son to be circumcised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Long Island, New York couple agreed to the routine procedure, but claim no one ever told them that circumcision &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/HCQ.0000000000000113"&gt;presented a serious bleeding risk&lt;/a&gt; for babies with congenital heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 etWNXC"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/05/IMG_3486.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/05/IMG_3486.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/05/IMG_3486.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt='Cole Groth is expected to remain in the hospital for "at least a couple of months," according to his dad' class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-16500"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Cole Groth is expected to remain in the hospital for "at least a couple of months," according to his dad&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Courtesy of the Groth family)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything seemed fine for the first two hours after the circumcision, according to a timeline laid out by Tim on his GoFundMe page. Then, around 2:30 a.m., things took a turn for the worse. Cole’s diaper was “full of blood, stool, urine, so full that it had leaked onto the sheets and his leg,” the fundraiser says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hospital staffer alerted the nurse practitioner who performed the circumcision that there were problems, and the nurse practitioner rewrapped Cole’s penis with adhesive strips. However, Cole’s condition continued to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six hours later, unable to stop the bleeding, doctors intubated Cole, and shortly after 9 a.m., he received an urgent transfusion of 40ml/kg of blood. Babies of this age typically have between 80ml/kg and 90ml/kg of blood in their bodies, meaning Cole lost roughly half the blood in his body, according to Tim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the bleeding led to a frightening series of seizures, along with kidney damage, liver damage and neurological damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next three days, Cole seemed to be recovering. But, Tim said, at 4 a.m. on April 19, the hospital called and told him and his wife that parts of Cole’s intestines had necrotized and needed to be removed immediately. The 20-day-old baby was rushed into the operating room, where doctors rushed to excise the dead tissue, the family’s GoFundMe page explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JOhlJ"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/26/Screenshot-2025-04-28-at-10-48-46-AM.png" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/26/Screenshot-2025-04-28-at-10-48-46-AM.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/26/Screenshot-2025-04-28-at-10-48-46-AM.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Tim Groth and his newborn son, Cole.

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists investigating an alarming rise in bowel  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="159331" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; in young adults have identified the bacterial toxin &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colibactin"&gt;colibactin&lt;/a&gt; as a potential culprit, with childhood exposure perhaps increasing the risk of later cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colibactin has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08135-z"&gt;already been linked&lt;/a&gt; to this cancer type, but the relationship hasn't been specifically studied in people under the age of 50 before. It may go some way to explaining why bowel (or colorectal) cancer is on course to be the leading cancer-related cause of death in young adults &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.4708"&gt;in the next few years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing cancer tissue samples from 981 individuals across 11 countries, an international team of researchers looked for cancer-causing mutations in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"&gt;DNA genome&lt;/a&gt;. In more than half of the early-onset cases, these mutations matched up with damage caused by colibactin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YRpOQEeXq44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These mutation patterns are a kind of historical record in the genome, and they point to early-life exposure to colibactin as a driving force behind early-onset disease," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/childhood-exposure-to-bacterial-toxin-may-be-triggering-colorectal-cancer-epidemic-among-the-young"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; computational biologist Ludmil Alexandrov of the University of California San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how is this exposure happening? The researchers aren't sure, but we do know that colibactin is produced by certain strains of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the gut, and the data suggests that the damaging exposure probably happens in the first 10 years of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more likely scenarios is that childhood infections are producing colibactin, which then damages DNA in the bowel. These harmful mutations then make cancer more likely later on, typically long after the colibactin has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, colibactin-related DNA mutations were 3.3 times more common in adults diagnosed under the age 40, compared to those diagnosed at age 70 or above. For cancer in older people, the DNA patterns were more often associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/extreme-heat-can-accelerate-aging-new-research-finds"&gt;normal aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If someone acquires one of these driver mutations by the time they're 10 years old, they could be decades ahead of schedule for developing colorectal cancer, getting it at age 40 instead of 60," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/childhood-exposure-to-bacterial-toxin-may-be-triggering-colorectal-cancer-epidemic-among-the-young"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Alexandrov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has identified several associations that could be contributing to the rise in colorectal cancer at a relatively young age. Studies have pointed to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-ultra-processed-foods-may-fuel-bowel-cancer"&gt;ultra-processed food&lt;/a&gt;, and too many &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alarming-rise-in-cancers-of-the-gut-linked-with-these-deadly-diets"&gt;sugary or alcoholic beverages&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the suggestion is that lifestyle or environmental factors very early on in life may also be planting seeds of the disease. Further research is needed to know for sure, though with recent science funding cutbacks in the US, that research is by no means guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also want to take a closer look at how colibactin and its related DNA scars could be protected against, as well as how the different factors affecting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-dramatically-lowers-the-risk-of-bowel-cancer-coming-back"&gt;this kind of cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; may vary between countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's possible that different countries have different unknown causes," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/childhood-exposure-to-bacterial-toxin-may-be-triggering-colorectal-cancer-epidemic-among-the-young"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; computational biologist Marcos Díaz-Gay of the Spanish National Cancer Research Center. "That could open up the potential for targeted, region-specific prevention strategies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09025-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Trump took office for his second term, thousands of health websites run by the federal government that kept the public informed about infectious diseases, mental health, vaccines and more were taken offline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Many eventually returned — in large part because a judge ordered the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/cdc-website-restore-pages-trump.html" title=""&gt;temporarily restore the pages&lt;/a&gt; — but some had been altered, with sections on topics such as health equity and teen pregnancy deleted. The changes, along with uncertainty around the future of these sites, has led some public health experts to question whether the websites can still be trusted as the gold standard of trustworthy health information, as they’ve long been regarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Federal health agencies are already facing a crisis of confidence. When a recent &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-january-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;national poll&lt;/a&gt; asked respondents how much trust they had in the C.D.C. to make the right health recommendations, more than one-third replied “not much” or “not at all.” Nearly half said the same about the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Experts fear that with less trust in public health institutions, more people seeking medical information might turn to social media, where misinformation is rampant. That has made it all the more valuable for the public to find evidenced-based sources of health information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here are five websites run by independent organizations that have accurate, easy-to-understand information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-357e41a8"&gt;1.

						&lt;p&gt;The SPCA of Wake County will close temporarily April 27-May 2 for deep cleaning due to a recent outbreak of canine parvovirus (CPV).&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Although the adoption center on Petfinder Lane will be closed for the next several days, &lt;a href="https://spcawake.org/appointments/" target="_blank"&gt;the SPCA is still accepting online adoption surveys&lt;/a&gt;, and cat adoptions will resume on April 30.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;According to the SPCA, parvovirus is a highly contagious virus that mainly impacts dogs, especially unvaccinated puppies. Parvovirus attacks the gastrointestinal tract and can lead to severe dehydration or death if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The SPCA of Wake County connected the outbreak to a litter of puppies that came to the SPCA from an overcrowded shelter in a nearby county. According to the SPCA, two puppies in the litter of six had parvovirus and are being treated. None of the puppies have died. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;People who recently adopted a pet exposed to the litter have been notified, and all exposed dogs are being monitored and quarantined, the SPCA said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Parvovirus is typically spread through direct contact with an infected dog or through contaminated surfaces, food, water bowls or human hands. It can survive for months, which is why a deep clean is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The SPCA of Wake County shared steps pet owners can take to protect their puppies from parvovirus:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/spca-wake-county-parvo-outbreak-closing-april-2024"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/spca-wake-county-parvo-outbreak-closing-april-2024/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vaccination: &lt;/b&gt;Ensure your puppy receives the full series of vaccinations. Speak with your veterinarian about your puppy’s vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Limit exposure: &lt;/b&gt;Avoid public places, such as dog parks or pet stores, until your puppy is fully vaccinated. Parvovirus is easily transmitted in environments where many dogs gather.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good hygiene: &lt;/b&gt;Keep your dog's living area clean and disinfected. Use appropriate cleaners that are effective against viruses. Regularly wash food and water bowls, toys and bedding.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seek veterinary advice&lt;/b&gt; if your puppy shows any signs of illness—such as lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, or loss of appetite—contact your veterinarian immediately for guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
