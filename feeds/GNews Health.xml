The compound was well tolerated, with only mild side effects, and benefits persisted for weeks after dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study was primarily designed to test safety, researchers observed meaningful and lasting improvements in multiple symptoms. The findings suggest psilocybin may enhance neuroplasticity and reduce inflammation, helping the brain heal itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustained Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Improvements in mood, cognition, and movement lasted for weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe and Well Tolerated:&lt;/strong&gt; Mild side effects reported, but no serious adverse events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Phase:&lt;/strong&gt; A larger, multi-site trial will explore underlying mechanisms like neuroplasticity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psilocybin, a natural compound found in certain mushrooms, has shown promise in treating depression and anxiety.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UC San Francisco researchers wanted to know if it could be used to help Parkinson’s patients who often experience debilitating mood dysfunction in addition to their motor symptoms and don’t respond well to antidepressants or other medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109366"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person sitting and mushrooms." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Another theory is that psilocybin could provide relief from multiple symptoms of the disease by reducing inflammation and promoting neuroplasticity – the growth and reconnection of brain cells involved in mood, cognition, and movement regulation. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did participants tolerate the drug without serious side effects or worsening symptoms, which is what the pilot study was designed to test, they also experienced clinically significant improvements in mood, cognition, and motor function that lasted for weeks after the drug was out of their systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the first time a psychedelic has been tested on patients with any neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are still in very early stages of this work, but this first study went well beyond what we expected,” said the paper’s first author, Ellen Bradley, MD, assistant professor and associate director of UCSF’s Translational Psychedelic Research Program (TrPR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people don’t realize this, but mood symptoms in Parkinson’s are linked to a faster physical decline,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And they are actually a stronger predictor of patients’ quality of life with Parkinson’s than their motor symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the TrPR Program, within UCSF’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and the Department of Neurology, teamed up to lead this project, which was funded by an anonymous donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings appeared online earlier this month in &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Psilocybin’s lasting mood and motor effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by uncontrolled movements due to abnormal brain activity, affects about 1 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While medications like levodopa can relieve symptoms, there are no approved therapies to slow the progression or reverse the disease itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common early physical symptoms include tremors and foot dragging, but Bradley said anxiety and depression in patients with no history of psychiatric problems often precede the onset of motor symptoms by several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear why standard medications often don’t work well for these patients, but mood changes could be part of the neurodegenerative disease process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the safety of psilocybin for these patients, the researchers gave seven men and five women with mild to moderate Parkinson’s disease a 10 mg dose, followed two weeks later by a higher dose of 25 mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients completed psychotherapy sessions before and after the psilocybin — eight sessions in total — and were evaluated for changes in mood, cognition, and motor functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While nearly all participants experienced some adverse events while on the psilocybin, such as anxiety, nausea, and elevated blood pressure, these were not serious enough to require medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants had meaningful improvements in their mood, cognition, and motor symptoms at both their one-week and one-month follow-up appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team evaluated the participants’ mood again three months after their psilocybin sessions and found it was still significantly improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggested a variety of explanations for the improvements. The beneficial impact of psilocybin on the patients’ mood could have led to better cognitive and motor functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, people feel better, and that, in turn, helps them socialize and become more active – both key elements of Parkinson’s treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another theory is that psilocybin could provide relief from multiple symptoms of the disease by reducing inflammation and promoting neuroplasticity – the growth and reconnection of brain cells involved in mood, cognition, and movement regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An expansion into unchartered territory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this pilot study were promising enough that the researchers are conducting a larger randomized controlled trial at UCSF, enrolling a larger and more diverse group of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study incorporates noninvasive brain stimulation, neuroimaging and other tools to understand how psilocybin impacts inflammation and neuroplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will include a second site at Yale University, with the aim of enrolling 100 participants. This work will be funded by the same anonymous donor that paid for the safety pilot as well as by the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vast majority of brain diseases still lack interventions that change the course of illness,” said the study’s senior author, Joshua Woolley, MD, PhD, associate professor at UCSF and director of the TrPR Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can often treat the symptoms, but we don’t alter the trajectory or prevent decline. Now, that’s beginning to change. These results raise the exciting possibility that psilocybin may help the brain repair itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Additional co-authors include Kimberly Sakai, BA, Gisele Fernandes-Osterhold, MFT, Balázs Szigeti, PhD, Connie Ludwig, PhD, Jill L.

For instance, most adults who never received the HPV vaccine do not know they are eligible, so it’s critical to inform them of their options, said Verda Hicks, a gynecologic oncologist based in Kansas City, Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AQMITZYMF5CQBF3ALOJNMGETUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The vaccine offers protection against nine types of HPV, she said.

Also, prices can vary depending on where care is delivered and tests are performed. If you need a blood test, ask that your doctor send the requisition &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/routine-bloodwork-lab-work-tests-surprise-bill/" target="_blank"&gt;to a commercial, in-network lab&lt;/a&gt;.

A meta-analysis of 231 brain studies showed that chronic sleep disorders alter regions involved in emotions and memory, while short-term deprivation primarily affects attention and movement regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings could pave the way for more targeted therapies and preventive strategies for mental illnesses linked to poor sleep. Understanding these neural differences may also help develop treatments tailored to specific types of sleep disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different Brain Regions:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic sleep disorders affect the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, while short-term sleep loss impacts the thalamus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic sleep loss raises the risk of depression, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could inform targeted therapies and future transdiagnostic studies across multiple sleep disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Forschungszentrum Juelich&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About 20% to 35% of the population suffers from chronic sleep disorders—and up to half of all people in older age. Moreover, almost every teenager or adult has experienced short-term sleep deprivation at some point. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for not getting enough sleep, whether it be partying, a long day at work, caring for relatives, or simply whiling away time on smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109362"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain on a bed." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These regions are involved in processing emotions, memories, decisions, and sensations, for example. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent meta-study, Jülich researchers have now been able to show that the brain regions involved in the short-term and long-term conditions differ significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Poor sleep is one of the most important—but changeable—risk factors for mental illnesses in adolescents and older people,” says Jülich researcher and Privatdozent Dr. Masoud Tahmasian, who coordinated the study. In contrast, long-term pathological sleep disorders, such as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and short-term sleep deprivation, are located in different parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Lack of sleep has negative impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerion Reimann, one of the lead authors of the study, who wrote his master’s thesis on this topic at the Jülich Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-7), says, “The symptoms of sleep deprivation are similar during the day. Anyone who has ever slept poorly or not had enough sleep will know how you often feel a bit grumpy—or unable to perform tasks well due to your attention and reaction times being significantly impaired.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated instances of sleep deprivation can have much more serious consequences. Studies show that frequent sleep deprivation has an adverse effect on brain development, reduces the removal of harmful substances from the brain, decreases emotional stability, and causes a massive decline in working memory as well as a person’s performance at school or at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic sleep disorders and a continual lack of sleep are also risk factors for various mental illnesses,” says Reimann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Different brain structures detected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jülich researchers analyzed data from 231 brain studies. The studies examined and compared several groups—for example, patients suffering from chronic sleep disorders with healthy individuals, or healthy, well-rested test subjects with those suffering from sleep deprivation. The results show clear neural differences between the groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with chronic sleep disorders showed changes in a region of the brain known as the “anterior cingulate cortex,” as well as in the right amygdala and in the hippocampus, one of the brain’s central hubs. These regions are involved in processing emotions, memories, decisions, and sensations, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reimann explains, “These abnormalities reflect common symptoms that occur during the day with various sleep disorders, such as exhaustion, memory problems, mood swings, and even depression. Whether the changes in the brain are the cause or a consequence of chronic sleep disorders remains to be seen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, short-term sleep deprivation was associated with changes in the right thalamus, a brain region responsible for temperature regulation, movement, and the perception of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This corresponds with the symptoms of short-term sleep deprivation,” says Reimann. “You are less attentive, restricted in your actions, and often feel the cold more easily.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Important findings for future studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were thus able to show for the first time that there are no overlapping brain regions between the two groups,” says Reimann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is important for future studies. We can now focus on the precise structural and functional regions and networks that are representative of the respective sleep disorder,” he emphasizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individual sleep disorders have previously been considered separately from one another. Now we can also address questions about chronic sleep disorders in transdiagnostic studies—in other words, we can examine several findings at the same time,” adds Tahmasian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings might also pave the way for more targeted therapies and preventive measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many patients who suffer from insomnia—or chronic sleep disorders in general—also have an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders, as well as Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia,” explains Reimann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that we know which brain regions are involved, we can investigate in more detail the effects of non-pharmacological therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, in comparison to pharmacological treatments for various sleep disorders,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gerion Reimann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/portal/DE/Home/home_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Forschungszentrum Juelich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Gerion Reimann – Forschungszentrum Juelich&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.0488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Distinct Convergent Brain Alterations in Sleep Disorders and Sleep Deprivation&lt;/a&gt;” by Gerion Reimann et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Convergent Brain Alterations in Sleep Disorders and Sleep Deprivation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disorders have different etiologies yet share some nocturnal and daytime symptoms, suggesting common neurobiological substrates; healthy individuals undergoing experimental sleep deprivation also report analogous daytime symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, brain similarities and differences between long-term sleep disorders and short-term sleep deprivation are unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the shared and specific neural correlates across sleep disorders and sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Sources&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and BrainMap were searched up to January 2024 to identify relevant structural and functional neuroimaging articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Selection&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole-brain neuroimaging articles reporting voxel-based group differences between patients with different sleep disorders and healthy control participants or between total or partial sleep-deprived and well-rested individuals were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Extraction and Synthesis&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant coordinates of group comparisons, their contrast direction (eg, patients &amp;lt; controls), and imaging modality were extracted. For each article, 2 raters independently evaluated eligibility and extracted data. Subsequently, several meta-analyses were performed with the revised activation likelihood estimation algorithm using &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .05 cluster-level familywise error correction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transdiagnostic regional brain alterations were identified across sleep disorders and among articles reporting sleep deprivation. Their associated behavioral functions and task-based or task-free connectivity patterns were explored using 2 independent datasets (BrainMap and the enhanced Nathan Kline Institute–Rockland Sample).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 231 articles (140 unique experiments, 3380 unique participants) were retrieved. The analysis across sleep disorders (n = 95 experiments) identified the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (176 voxels, &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; score = 4.86), associated with reward, reasoning, and gustation, and the amygdala and hippocampus (130 voxels, &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; score = 4.00), associated with negative emotion processing, memory, and olfaction. Both clusters had positive functional connectivity with the default mode network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right thalamus (153 voxels, &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; score = 5.21) emerged as a consistent regional alteration following sleep deprivation (n = 45 experiments). This cluster was associated with thermoregulation, action, and pain perception and showed positive functional connectivity with subcortical and (pre)motor regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subanalyses regarding the direction of alterations demonstrated that the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex exhibited decreased activation, connectivity, and/or volume, while the amygdala and hippocampus cluster and the thalamus cluster demonstrated increased activation,connectivity, and/or volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distinct convergent brain abnormalities were observed between long-term sleep disorders (probably reflecting shared symptoms) and short-term sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 13:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE4wTS1zdHF3RUM5cHNFcWdwWjEyTV9od2o3eUJiSnZqS0E3dDF2MHdDSklPWnV2aEpSY3JGQWwxY1U1YjJMMGVSY0N4VjM3ZUhXVUZIR1Y3RVNNTldNM25ncDdCRTlwT2VkLXJrZUp3</guid></item><item><title>您可以和孩子一起尝试这个快乐的7分钟锻炼-《华盛顿邮报》 | Try this joyful 7-minute workout you can do with kids - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNVVNDaXV2VXJBVHVlRXI5U0dDN01ZR0xMVlhkMmtjTjRqaEFzdzlKaUlIbV9YeEpoN1ZkM0FBUWZRTkd1a2hTdE5Ma1MwNkxmbU9MdS1SV0tzY2hrU0FjN2NqSW96MjlZYnlKRmtYM1ZHVnFSQzVkTWpsY1NGNGRaUTN6RC1Zb2thZnBrWFV3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story relative"&gt;&lt;p id="KCABHNW2KVBK7COBWCUYX5CEBI" data-contentid="KCABHNW2KVBK7COBWCUYX5CEBI" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;Here’s an easy way to add fun and fitness to your family life: Invite the kids to spend the next seven minutes with you, scurrying through an imaginary park, ducking branches, dodging lava and crawling like a bear, as part of the new, science-based 7-minute workout with kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5KS2U5IY55GEDHL3GHZQ4PRA4E" data-contentid="5KS2U5IY55GEDHL3GHZQ4PRA4E" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;This workout, developed by exercise physiologist Chris Jordan for The Washington Post, with input from his two children, is meant to help combat the growing inactivity of America’s youths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;recommends a minimum of 60 minutes a day of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/children.html?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; for young people who don’t have health or disability issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="PJLV PJLV-igWRsMW-css"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="A2S6SGD6IRFQLDLHFNPTUSZNAE" data-contentid="A2S6SGD6IRFQLDLHFNPTUSZNAE" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;But less than a third of children and teens meet that minimum amount, according to the Physical Activity Alliance, a group of academics and policymakers. In its 2024 &lt;a href="https://paamovewithus.org/us-report-card-on-physical-activity-for-children-and-youth/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Report Card on Physical Activity&lt;/a&gt;, the group gave American kids’ current activity levels a D-minus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV ad--enterprise"&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV PJLV-ikOErwM-css"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-lg mt-lg pt-md pb-md flex"&gt;&lt;div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"&gt;&lt;p class="dib flex divider gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="SNKBLPJPQBFHFMHMNFJXWNGEOE" data-contentid="SNKBLPJPQBFHFMHMNFJXWNGEOE" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;Many of their parents wouldn’t score much better. A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/11/5942?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; found that parents with young children, especially several young children, generally get less exercise than people without children. There are so many demands, so little time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="QH7LI6BRGRAQ3BHNKYHI3PXKVU" data-contentid="QH7LI6BRGRAQ3BHNKYHI3PXKVU" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;Which is where the 7-minute workout with kids comes in. Jordan designed it to improve both endurance and muscular strength for adults and children, he said, with exercises alternately focusing on the upper and lower body, as well as the core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div target="_blank" class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-hHnAni-type-inline wpds-c-PJLV-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-ciKXky wpds-c-ciKXky-hNRVRD-type-inline"&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-bmgAQv"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Save this story to do the workout again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ID3JHX25YRH7LMTNDIGPQ35UGU" data-contentid="ID3JHX25YRH7LMTNDIGPQ35UGU" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;But, above all, he means it to be a blast. “Any physical activity for kids should be fun,” he said — not a chore but a route to joy. So this 7-minute workout involves imagination, as well as exertion. Pretend you and your offspring are sprinting through a park or a lava field or schussing side by side down a snowy ski slope. Customize the workout to your interests and your child’s. Fitness will follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="GTHK2OOFMRHSZFHDXHJH2OA6X4" data-contentid="GTHK2OOFMRHSZFHDXHJH2OA6X4" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;There’s also no reason grandparents or neighbors can’t recruit their favorite children to do the workout with them. Everyone benefits. “In my experience,” Jordan said, “kids are more likely to engage in and enjoy physical activity if you do it with them,” and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="6PTCNK3ASZFBFFCGWAXVT4JFCM" data-contentid="6PTCNK3ASZFBFFCGWAXVT4JFCM" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;Like all of the 7-minute workout series — the&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-science-original/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;original&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-low-impact-exercises-modified/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;gentle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-advanced-level-up/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; versions — this routine involves 12 exercises, each done for 30 seconds with a brief break in between. Do it anywhere there’s enough uncluttered space for all of you. You don’t need equipment, and the exercises should be doable for most people of almost any age. But don’t hesitate to start slow and let everyone get familiar with them. Then rev up the speed, until you’re all doing as many repetitions of each move as you can in 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="VBWMZPL6IRCSBHGL2UHD3X63JU" data-contentid="VBWMZPL6IRCSBHGL2UHD3X63JU" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;“Charlie and Charlotte love this workout,” Jordan said of his children, ages 11 and 5. “Charlie competed with me from start to finish, and Charlotte giggled all the way through.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="PJLV PJLV-igWRsMW-css"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-gFGKna"&gt;&lt;p class="intro"&gt;&lt;h4 class="wpds-c-blyyIN wpds-c-blyyIN-jiHlZe-as-h4 wpds-c-blyyIN-ifkTeWT-css"&gt;More 7-minute workouts&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-gPkNXM wpds-c-gPkNXM-ifofaeA-css"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV"&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-fYIIRZ"&gt;Stay up to date on the 7-minute workout series by signing up for the weekly Well+Being newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV ad--enterprise"&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV PJLV-icAbLfl-css"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-lg mt-lg pt-md pb-md flex"&gt;&lt;div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"&gt;&lt;p class="dib flex divider gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-iZPJvs"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-hEgojh"&gt;&lt;h5 class="wpds-c-blyyIN wpds-c-blyyIN-cpxyFJ-as-h5 wpds-c-blyyIN-idGqeAE-css"&gt;About this story&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css"&gt;Workout and audio narration by Chris Jordan.

Thousands.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the complaints were about the same medication: Vyvanse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vyvanse, with the active ingredient lisdexamfetamine, is a common treatment for ADHD in Australia, and, according to Jane, one she had previously heard a lot of positive endorsements about from people in the ADHD community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I used to hear women telling me how much it had changed their lives, or that of their kids,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'People are at their wits' end, saying their homes are in chaos and the kids are struggling, along with themselves,' says Jane McFadden, host of popular ADHD Mums podcast (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The packaging of Vyvanse has changed slightly since the TGA approved an overseas alternative supplier while stocks are low.

So does she.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'The flood of comments has been overwhelming,' explains Jane McFadden, host of the popular ADHD Mums podcast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The TGA has confirmed supplies of Concerta (methylphenidate hydrochloride) are running low &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emma suspects the change could be to do with the efficacy of the Vyvanse her daughter was taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jane agrees, believing it's possible the problem could be traced back to last year, when there was a shortage of the drug Australia-wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In December 2023, the medication's sponsor, Takeda Pharmaceuticals Australia, notified the TGA about the limited availability of some strengths due to manufacturing delays and increased demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In response, the TGA approved the supply of an overseas-registered alternative to Vyvanse 60mg in order to help bridge the gap until supplies returned to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since this happened, the actual label has changed,' explains Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It looks different, which is fine, but on one strength, the word "pharmaceutical" is actually spelled incorrectly. It doesn't engender a lot of trust.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sydney woman H.T. (who didn't want her full name published) was so concerned by the change she experienced that she, along with many others, reported her experience to the TGA's adverse events recording system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After initially having great success with Vyvanse, the 31-year-old found that shortly after filling a new script at the start of this year, she began experiencing worrying symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had an irregular heartbeat, and started to have random anxiety when it's something I've never suffered with before,' H.T. explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was picking my hair to the point I created bald patches, and I had insomnia so severe that if I couldn't sleep and it was 6am and I needed to be ready for the day, I'd just take my next Vyvanse dose and stay awake all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By the evening I still wasn't sleepy so I would take a sleeping aid. All this was documented with my psychiatrist as I was going through the experience.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being prescribed a number of other medications in order to mitigate the impact, including an antidepressant and sleeping pills, H.T. noticed the spelling error on her new packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I went home and compared the two and tried to find information online and there was nothing. That's when I made my first post on a small Facebook group on March 10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I asked if anyone had noticed the package change and the spelling errors and then a description of why I was concerned. The amount of comments that were extremely similar to mine confirmed that it wasn't just me, and that it wasn't a placebo effect from seeing the package change, because all my symptoms and concerns were documented with my psychiatrist prior to noticing the packaging change.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next day H.T. called the TGA and asked if they knew what was going on&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was starting to believe that maybe the new batch was counterfeit,' she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;H.T. says the TGA informed her they did not have to notify consumers of any packaging change, nor could they confirm if there had been one, though they did say they were investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daily Mail Australia has since to spoken to more than 10 women who claim to have experienced adverse effects from the new Vyvanse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A TGA spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia they were aware of a recent increase in reports relating to medicines used to treat ADHD following an uptick in social media commentary, and that an investigation into these concerns is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the spokesperson clarified that minor labelling errors have been identified and are in the process of being corrected.

Methylphenidate hydrochloride (sold as Concerta) is running low, with the TGA confirming limited supply of its 18mg, 27mg, 36mg and 54mg modified-release tablet products until the end of May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now we're in this very confusing space when it comes to how we can all live, work and stay alive, because it seems nearly every stimulant medication used to treat ADHD has either a major issue with it or it is unavailable,' Jane says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of particular concern, she adds, are the parents who have resorted to sourcing the medication without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You have a controlled substance that some mums are now "black-marketing" because they are desperate,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're in school holidays.

One dose is 93% effective and two doses are 97% effective against measles, the CDC says. Most vaccinated adults don't need an additional dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;At current vaccination rates, the model predicts measles could once again become endemic -- constantly present -- in the U.S. with an estimated 851,300 cases over 25 years.

"I think it's a bit of a worst-case scenario but, as a worst-case scenario, it's scary and, in that sense, reasonable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, the model estimated that just a 5% increase in vaccination would lead to only 5,800 cases over the same 25-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This is because when more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most are protected from measles through community immunity, also known as herd immunity, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"My hope is that this study can provide that data to parents to say, 'This is the benefit of continuing to vaccinate your child. This is the kind of alternate reality that we're preventing. And yes, the risks aren't here right now, but perhaps not too far off,'" Lo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Schaffner said there are pockets of the U.S. where MMR vaccination rates are 80% or less and vaccination rates would need to increase substantially in those areas to reduce the number of cases long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, "if we increase the level of vaccination by a small amount that would reduce the risk of other small outbreaks here and there," Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study also found that a 50% drop in vaccinations would lead to an estimated 51.2 million cases over 25 years, but Lo thinks that would only occur if there were a large-scale policy change by the Department of Health and Human Services or the CDC to reduce or remove the childhood vaccine recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As of Friday, the CDC has &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed nearly 900 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; in at least 29 states.

At least 87 people have been hospitalized over the course of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Measles was declared &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank"&gt;eliminated from the U.S. in 2000&lt;/a&gt; due to the highly effective vaccination program, according to the CDC. However, an outbreak lasting 12 months or more would threaten to end measles elimination status in the U.S. The Texas outbreak began in January of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;To drive vaccination rates up, Lo and Schaffner recommend that parents who haven't vaccinated their children yet speak to their pediatrician to address their concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We have to provide recommendations and let people know the facts that these vaccines are very effective and that they are safe," Schaffner said.

                A survey of older Americans found that 79% would want to know if they were in the early stages of Alzheimer's, and 92% said that if diagnosed, they would probably or definitely want to take a drug that could slow down the disease's progression. The results may indicate a recent shift in openness toward Alzheimer's testing and treatment.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Older Americans want to know if they are in the early stages of Alzheimer's and would happily take a blood test to find out, according to a national survey.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The survey of 1,700 people 45 and older, part of a &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the Alzheimer's Association, found growing interest in testing, diagnosis, and treatment for the deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More than 7 million people in the United States are now living with Alzheimer's, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Among the survey's key findings:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– Nearly four in five respondents (79%) would want to know they had the disease before symptoms began to interfere with their daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;– 80% said they would ask a doctor to be tested, rather than waiting for a test to be offered.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;– 91% said they'd want a blood biomarker test, or some other simple test, if one were available. (Most respondents did not know that several blood tests already on the market can indicate the presence of amyloid plaques in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer's.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– 92% said that if diagnosed with Alzheimer's, they would probably or definitely want to take a drug that could slow down the disease's progression. (Two recently approved drugs, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/07/06/1186225580/alzheimers-drug-leqembi-gets-full-fda-approval-medicare-coverage-lecanemab"&gt;lecanemab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/10/g-s1-3818/fda-advisors-back-alzheimer-drug-donanemab-despite-risks"&gt;donanemab&lt;/a&gt;, can do this for people in the earliest stages.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– 58% said they would take an Alzheimer's drug even if it had a moderate or high risk of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– 83% said that, if diagnosed, they would be open to participating in a clinical trial of an experimental treatment to slow or cure the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– 81% expect that in the next decade, treatments will arrive that can halt the progression of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;– 44% say they are worried that insurance will not cover treatment and care if a test indicates they have the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A shift in perspective &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The responses show that people are becoming less afraid and more proactive about an Alzheimer's diagnosis, says &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/press/spokespeople/elizabeth-edgerly" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Elizabeth Edgerly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist who directs community programs for the Alzheimer's Association.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In the past, Edgerly says her clients would often say, "Well gosh, I wouldn't want to know," or "Why would I want to know?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One reason for the change may be that it's now easier to find out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Just a few years ago, it took a PET scan or spinal tap to confirm the presence of sticky amyloid plaques in the brain, Edgerly says. Now, a simple blood test can often provide the answer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Another factor is the arrival of drug treatment for people in the early stages of Alzheimer's, Edgerly says. That gives people another reason to get a diagnosis while they are still capable of making their own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While symptoms are still mild, Edgerly says, "they can articulate what they'd like for their future, they can decide whether they want to try treatments."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The arrival of drug treatment has made people living with Alzheimer's more optimistic, says Dr. Nathaniel Chin, a geriatrician at the University of Wisconsin who was not involved in the survey.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Even if it doesn't stop the disease in its tracks, it tells people that we're making progress," he says. "They want to know if they potentially could have this therapy or maybe the next therapy or two therapies down the road."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The survey results reflect changes in the public's attitude toward Alzheimer's that Chin is seeing in his own practice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I don't think people are as fearful as they have been in the past," he says. "I think there's a desire to know what's happening to our bodies."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Patient-driven change&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many doctors, though, remain skeptical about the benefits of testing. Chin says that's in part because they see existing drugs as only marginally helpful.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Some patients are ahead of their doctors in this regard," he says. "They want this information and they are going to ask about it."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Chin offers blood tests to his own patients with cognitive problems. And he expects the tests to become increasingly common.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But that is likely to bring some new challenges, he says. For example, many health professionals are not trained to counsel people who have just learned they have Alzheimer's. And a positive test result in someone's medical record has the potential to jeopardize their job, or health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There are protections for people who learn their genetic information," he says, "but as of now there are not protections for people who are learning if you are cognitively unimpaired or cognitively healthy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now that more people are finding out, he says, it's up to groups including the Alzheimer's Association to push for those protections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, certain types of important doctors that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clinical trial confirmed the health benefits of eating walnuts in improving colonic health and for cancer prevention, a spokesperson for &lt;a href="https://medicine.uconn.edu/"&gt;UConn School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/ellagitannin"&gt;Ellagitannins&lt;/a&gt; in the walnut are importantly providing the anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties that we’re seeing in patients in our clinical trial research, particularly the gut’s conversion of ellagitannins to a potent anti-inflammatory agent, urolithin A,” said Daniel W. Rosenberg, who leads a multidisciplinary team of researchers at the UConn School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-iLgdKCFX" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_iLgdKCFX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put in everyday language, Rosenberg said, “There are many potential benefits one can get from eating walnuts, with so little downside risk, that just grabbing a handful every day is really something that you can easily do for your long-term health benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg, who has studied walnut properties for more than a decade, serves as the HealthNet Chair in Cancer Biology and is an investigator in the &lt;a href="https://health.uconn.edu/molecular-oncology/"&gt;Center for Molecular Oncology.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg has also researched the connection between walnut consumption and its anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UConn research team’s clinical trial findings show that high levels of urolithin A formation by the gut microbiome from walnut consumption has a positive impact on reducing inflammatory markers across blood, urine, and fecal samples, and may even positively affect the immune cells within colon polyps, according to UConn.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;For the clinical trial, patients between the ages of 40 to 65 years and at an elevated risk for colon cancer, were referred for the study from the &lt;a href="https://health.uconn.edu/gastroenterology/#:~:text=The%20Division%20of%20Gastroenterology%20and%20Hepatology%20is%20committed%20to%20current,%2C%20liver%2C%20pancreas%20and%20colon."&gt;Division of Gastroenterology at UConn Health&lt;/a&gt;, the University of Connecticut’s academic medical center, according to UConn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of 39 enrolled study participants were screened by the clinical research team at UConn John Dempsey Hospital and asked to complete an NIH Food Frequency Questionnaire for analysis by Ock Chun Ph.D., a nutritional epidemiologist in the &lt;a href="https://cahnr.uconn.edu/"&gt;College of Agriculture, Health and Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt; at UConn Storrs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients were asked to avoid all ellagitannin-containing foods and beverages for a week to set their urolithin levels at or close to zero before they began consuming ellagitannin-rich walnuts as part of their closely monitored diet, according to a statement from UConn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the three-week study, all participants received a high-definition colonoscopy done by Drs. John Birk and Haleh Vaziri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the key findings the researchers found that elevated &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609777/"&gt;urolithin A&lt;/a&gt; levels in the urine of patients correlated with the serum levels of peptide YY, a protein that has been associated with inhibition of colorectal cancer. Reduced levels of several inflammation markers present in the blood were also found, especially in obese patients that had the greatest capacity to form urolithins by their gut microbiome, according to a statement from UConn.&lt;/p&gt;

Jan. 7, 2023 (Tina Encarnacion/UConn Health Photo) (Tina Encarnacion/UConn Health Photo)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg also used high-dimensional spatial imaging technology that allowed UConn researchers to develop a detailed view of cellular interactions present inside colon polyps that were removed during colonoscopy at the end of the walnut study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imaging technology revealed that patients with high levels of urolithin A formation following walnut consumption was associated with reduced levels of several important proteins that are often present in polyps, showing for the first time how walnut ingestion may enhance colon health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team also found that the protein vimentin, often associated with more advanced forms of colon cancer, was greatly reduced inside polyp tissues obtained from patients who had also formed the highest levels of urolithin A by their gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings build upon the earlier work of Dr. Masako Nakanishi, an assistant professor in the Rosenberg Lab, who showed in several earlier publications that walnuts had beneficial and anti-cancer effects in the colons of cancer-prone mice, key findings that prompted the current clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Urolithin A has a very positive influence on inflammation and maybe even cancer prevention,” Rosenberg said. “Our study proves that dietary supplementation with walnuts can boost the general population’s urolithin levels in those people with the right microbiome, while significantly reducing several inflammatory markers, especially in obese patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenberg said the study provides strong rationale for dietary inclusion of walnut ellagitannins for cancer prevention.&lt;br&gt;
The research was supported by awards from the American Institute for Cancer Research, the &lt;a href="https://walnuts.org/about-us/california-walnut-commission/"&gt;California Walnut Commission&lt;/a&gt;, and the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

He charged $2,000 annually per patient. Neither my husband nor I chose to participate. We found a new doctor who we have been very happy with for the past two years. Now he has decided to go concierge as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He is charging $2,000 annually or offering patients who do not wish to participate in a concierge practice an opportunity to pay an "administrative" fee of $500 annually to continue as one of his patients. Both my husband and I have very good insurance that covers 100% of our medical costs, and I saw my doctor three times last year. I told him that paying an additional payment of over $150 per visit is ridiculous. So, once again, we are looking for another physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This appears to be occurring quite often in my area. My question to you is, do you think this is right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— P.E.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear P.E.:&lt;/strong&gt; In my opinion, concierge medicine can be done ethically, but I have real questions about the way your physician is moving to a concierge or "retainer" medicine practice. If a physician chooses to move to a concierge model, which by itself is not unethical, they ought to help their existing patients find care and aid with the transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I don't agree with the $500 "administrative fee" per year, which sounds like a charge solely to remain as his patient and get no additional service. I understand the benefits of a concierge practice to a physician, and for those who can afford it, there are advantages for the patient, too. But it is my personal opinion that we physicians have an obligation to provide care. I have known concierge physicians who volunteer at free clinics as a way of fulfilling their professional obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I first heard about a disease called "sweating sickness" while watching a television series. Do people still get sweating sickness under a different name?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— J.S.B.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear J.S.B.:&lt;/strong&gt; Sweating sickness was a disease that was found in England between 1485-1581 but wasn't seen again. The major symptoms were a rapid onset of a high fever with sweating, then death following in hours or days. The details of the described cases at the time have led medical historians to suspect that the disease was a very dangerous virus such as a hantavirus, which causes a hemorrhagic fever in Europe and Asia and a heart/lung syndrome in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hantaviruses normally exist in rodents but can occasionally cross over into humans. Less than 1,000 cases of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome have been reported in the United States as of 2021, but a prominent actor's wife recently died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Other authorities suspect that sweating sickness was caused by an enterovirus (a large family of viruses that is responsible for many diseases, including polio), which is the suspected cause in a condition called acute flaccid myelitis. But we can only guess at the cause of this mysterious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Highly virulent germs (those that kill their hosts) often die out quickly as they kill their hosts before many people get infected. However, some diseases become less virulent over time since the germs that don't kill people have more time to quickly spread to other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Syphilis, for example, was a rapidly fatal disease in Europe during the 16th century, but by the 18th century, it had become a much more indolent disease. (Though, of course, it's still dangerous and should be avoided.) The main barrier to syphilis treatment now is getting people diagnosed. &lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 03:33:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxPTzVzOV9UaFB2Z0JlNVU0eFRfS3pLLXR5dFdmSWtfX1dMVk9CU2xXQno5V0tYLVpRMU5IWmVzbktORDMwY1JGUDhVR29KXzl0Mm1SRm5Yb0c1TGZuajJsaG5QSWRqSEtjaXRpVy0yVEw3aE9qTjFEbHZHLUtZcm9TX0hGaDVkX19KVFRCWnFvckdoTVlnWkkwOVFzTnV2M1JFS3Y2NzZIUWV4ZFhCRE55Z2Y5OGV4eTRUeUs1SEpzNEpoNko1NVFLVzVn</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.告诉新父母“自己做疫苗研究” - HuffPost | RFK Jr. Tells New Parents To 'Do Your Own Research' On Vaccines - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxQazIyd2NYMkt5Y3p0M1M2QzFMTG1mbTNOT1ZPTExVeXNQbFd3SWlpWkJpYV9KUEY3UTVwcjNEOEFaa20zS1YxM2F1NlpPblBhd05RcVI3cWhQQlJWbzVBQkVkWWxVT2EzNEczZUpTenQzTXpkOXpiT0x4dnhFN294cFhPRFIxMzR6bW9ScWFncDZUV1dNQ29Pc1FB0gGfAUFVX3lxTFBoME5zMDVsRHo3R3JxMS1uVEhkMkViRXFBVTdLMXZOWWZFSnFrS0FISnlvdFF5VFFvT1ZOeHpHaDM1WjUtbUFkUms3bzE1YThfelpiT1AwUEdXQVk0VDg0NXR6WGFQNW1OVk5yTlBNWTRBWEV1OEhKQ0hETVZNR3RHTWNsR0VWWjdUTU93OG95SVpsbkpQXzZ5ek1XVWp1aw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite leading the government department tasked with advising Americans on their health and safety, Robert F.

&lt;p&gt;Experts say to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/11/lifestyle/heres-the-disgusting-reason-why-you-should-never-wear-new-clothes-without-washing-them/"&gt;wash newly bought clothes&lt;/a&gt; before wearing them — especially if they’re from a second-hand store. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this one poor soul learned this lesson the hard way. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Jam Press, a TikToker (&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@onenevertwoo_one" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;@‌onenevertwhoo_one&lt;/a&gt;) who preferred to only be referred to by his social media name, contracted a skin infection most likely due to his never-washed thrifted clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He explained in a now-viral video that he contracted molluscum contagiosum, a viral skin infection that consists of small, raised bumps on the skin. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite looking painful, apparently the condition is harmless and does not require treatment, according to NeedToKnow.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Although this skin disease is often spread through skin-to-skin or sexual contact, the TikToker blames his unwashed thrifted clothes for his welts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The content creator’s assumption might be accurate because, according to &lt;a href="https://www.human.cornell.edu/people/fhk2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frances Kozen, &lt;/a&gt;a Cornell University senior lecturer in fiber science and apparel design, garments often are treated with a fabric softener, a stain-resistant or water-repellent coating, or an anti-mildew agent that can cause irritation, redness or itching, she &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/wash-new-clothes-before-wearing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;told Self magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His vulnerable video received millions of views and thousands of comments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some empathised with him: “I hope you get well soon and are as healthy as before.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And others were confused about how he made this mistake. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Why don’t you wash your clothes first?” a commenter asked. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“New fear unlocked,” another person chimed in. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“More shocked because just found out someone bought clothes not washed,” someone else wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/population_and_sustainability/pdfs/Unravelling-Harms-of-Fast-Fashion-Full-Report-2023-02.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;They have things on them&lt;/a&gt; that you don’t want on your skin,” he said in the video. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that molluscum contagiosum is not the only skin condition someone can become infected with if they wear clothes straight from a store or online. People also put themselves at risk of contracting ringworm if they don’t listen to the experts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ringworm-body/symptoms-causes/syc-20353780" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, ringworm, which affects the outer layer of the skin, is itchy, scaly and contagious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[Ringworm] can spread through clothing, towels, and bedding that [has] not been disinfected after use by someone with [ringworm],” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ringworm/hcp/clinician-brief-resistant-infections/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;advised the Center for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; in a report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So if someone is trying on clothes at a store and has ringworm, and you buy those same clothes and don’t wash them first — you’re at risk of also getting the skin condition.&lt;/p&gt;

officials in Texas said the child had not had underlying health conditions and died of “what the child’s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;An unvaccinated child, aged six, also with no underlying conditions, died of measles in Texas in late February, Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers have warned that the country is at a tipping point for the return of endemic measles, a quarter-century after the disease was declared eradicated from the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The rate of rise in measles cases appears to be slowing down, but it is still concerning that we are seeing more cases adding to the count,” said Sapna Singh, chief medical officer at Texas Children’s Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;New Mexico’s health department reported 66 cases on Tuesday, the same as its last update. Most of the state’s cases are from Lea county, adjacent to Gaines county in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The ideal situation is to see a few weeks of no increase in the case count before we can have some optimism in the spread slowing down,” said Singh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;US pediatricians and infectious disease experts say the fight against rising measles cases nationwide is being hampered by a lack of forceful advocacy for vaccination from government health officials and statements on unproven treatments that are confusing parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Doctors assert that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection. Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. The disease has been considered eliminated from the US since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other states with active outbreaks – defined as three or more cases – include Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;With one-fifth of states seeing active measles outbreaks, the US is nearing 900 cases, according to figures posted Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC’s confirmed measles cases count is 884, triple the amount seen in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates – above 95% – diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their children from required shots. The US saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 00:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5BWU13ZUxRV0xBSjJxTE9CbEw3dHRKZjFvUzVjaGt4QXduWUZLOEhtLVNvOXRDODhoYTd0Z1Y0WlB1a3RTWjBlSk5zRWtMeUp6WmJna2VKcnBNdmFZeU1OVFhLZC0wTGFsa3RVV2NEX3R1dWN2bUE</guid></item><item><title>这就是为什么有些人会食物中毒而其他人不会- BuzzFeed | So THAT'S Why Some People Get Food Poisoning And Others Don't - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE5PYlU2T3BMR2luRk9RZExCaU9LOVQ0dks5Q0k0NTJnUFEwb19NeG9oR3pSNHpGQ3NxemxWMGprbE02aVhOS0c2cHBaMnJjTkVCNmFydkFnVk1HVHpLZ2dXbFl6aEo3LXdQTEQ4ODZkQkRxcm95WVJiOHdpa3lqZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, your body may not be able to fight off food poisoning. Every single person is completely different in a multitude of ways, including their immune system and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25201-gut-microbiome" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7868939" data-affiliate="true"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, the home of trillions of microorganisms that can influence your digestive system and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to food poisoning, it completely disrupts your gut microbiome, which is why you feel so sick. If you and your friend eat the same undercooked hamburger and you have an unhealthy microbiome while they have a healthier one, you may experience a bit of an upset stomach afterward.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A person with an inadequate microbiome will experience food poisoning more often,” Mazur said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you fuel your body with healthy foods, your microbiome will thrive. If you don’t, your gut microbiome may not be able to fight off bacteria from the undercooked or raw food that gave you food poisoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mazur said the characteristics of an inadequate microbiome are a lack of beneficial bacteria and microbial diversity, as well as high concentrations of pathogenic bacteria, which is a significant risk factor for frequent bouts of food poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted two other things that can affect whether someone gets sick or not: if they ate enough of the food to become infected, and what else they ate or drank that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you started the day drinking alcohol heavily, you’ve already damaged your healthy microbiome for the day, making you more susceptible on that specific day,” Mazur said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your diet plays a part in how healthy your gut microbiome is. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

At one point she even considered having her eye removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was only after Ellie was offered a "last resort" analysis called metagenomics, that she was diagnosed with a rare bacterial infection which was cured with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's been transformative," Ellie told the BBC. "I feel so fortunate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Professor Carlos Pavesio, consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, says Ellie's case is a "breakthrough in the diagnosis of infectious diseases". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There are many patients we treat with chronic infections for years, but despite multiple tests we cannot identify the bug responsible," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 2019, while still at medical school, Ellie began suffering from inflammation in her right eye. All tests for infection came back negative and it was assumed she had an autoimmune condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ellie was prescribed steroid eye drops and immunosuppressants, some of which needed to be given by intravenous infusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It was completely dominating my life," Ellie says. "I needed eye drops every single hour and it was difficult to balance that alongside starting work as a junior doctor. My vision was really variable, and I would have some bad days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I was on so much medication and going to so many appointments, yet I didn't feel I was getting any better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The treatment and inflammation led to Ellie developing a cataract that had to be surgically removed, just after she graduated from medical school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ellie says she eventually reached "breaking point", and even began considering having her affected eye removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Whilst losing sight in one eye is terrifying," she says, "my biggest fear was that it might spread to my left eye."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Ellie Irwin A close-up of Ellie's right eye which shows a cataract - a cloudy light blue circle in the centre of the eye - which causes blurry vision" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Ellie Irwin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Ellie's eye developed a cataract that had to be removed&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was one of Ellie's doctors at Southmead Hospital in Bristol who suggested metagenomics - a last resort test not generally available to patients and only used where standard diagnostic tools have failed to identify or rule out infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Metagenomics technology uses cutting-edge genomic sequencing, which can identify all bacteria, fungi or parasites present in a sample by comparing them against a database of millions of pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A team at Moorfields Eye Hospital arranged for a sample of fluid to be taken from inside Ellie's eye and sent to the metagenomics labs at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) - the only lab in the UK officially recognised to carry out these diagnostic tests for patients, and one of only a few in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Currently, the standard method for detecting bacterial infections is by trying to grow a sample of it in a Petri dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For viruses, the most common diagnostic tool is a PCR test. These will be familiar to many from the pandemic, when millions sent off swabs in the post to confirm whether they had Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, Dr Julianne Brown, principal clinical scientist at the GOSH metagenomics service, says PCR has some drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The trouble with PCR is that you have to think of the viruses that might be causing an infection and do a separate test for each and every one," she says. "So if you've got an infection with something that's unexpected, rare or not previously known, you won't find it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Brown says metagenomics is "an enormous step up - it's a complete game-changer".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1bc1/live/87fecb30-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Ellie Irwin Ellie and friends swimming in the Amazon river, with their heads above the surface and the sun rising behind the trees in the background." class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Ellie Irwin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Doctors believe Ellie's eye condition was caused by an infection she caught while swimming in the Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In Ellie's case, metagenomics diagnosed a rare strain of the bacterial infection leptospirosis found in South America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is now presumed Ellie picked up the bug swimming in the Amazon river in 2018, while on a trip to Ecuador and Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ellie says it was an emotional moment when she was given the results of the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I broke down - I just had to cry.

At one point she even considered having her eye removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was only after Ellie was offered a "last resort" analysis called metagenomics, that she was diagnosed with a rare bacterial infection which was cured with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's been transformative," Ellie told the BBC. "I feel so fortunate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Professor Carlos Pavesio, consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, says Ellie's case is a "breakthrough in the diagnosis of infectious diseases". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There are many patients we treat with chronic infections for years, but despite multiple tests we cannot identify the bug responsible," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 2019, while still at medical school, Ellie began suffering from inflammation in her right eye. All tests for infection came back negative and it was assumed she had an autoimmune condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ellie was prescribed steroid eye drops and immunosuppressants, some of which needed to be given by intravenous infusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It was completely dominating my life," Ellie says. "I needed eye drops every single hour and it was difficult to balance that alongside starting work as a junior doctor. My vision was really variable, and I would have some bad days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I was on so much medication and going to so many appointments, yet I didn't feel I was getting any better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The treatment and inflammation led to Ellie developing a cataract that had to be surgically removed, just after she graduated from medical school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ellie says she eventually reached "breaking point", and even began considering having her affected eye removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Whilst losing sight in one eye is terrifying," she says, "my biggest fear was that it might spread to my left eye."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/67d6/live/46e265d0-2502-11f0-b324-e10b0a7b708d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Ellie Irwin A close-up of Ellie's right eye which shows a cataract - a cloudy light blue circle in the centre of the eye - which causes blurry vision" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Ellie Irwin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Ellie's eye developed a cataract that had to be removed&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was one of Ellie's doctors at Southmead Hospital in Bristol who suggested metagenomics - a last resort test not generally available to patients and only used where standard diagnostic tools have failed to identify or rule out infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Metagenomics technology uses cutting-edge genomic sequencing, which can identify all bacteria, fungi or parasites present in a sample by comparing them against a database of millions of pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A team at Moorfields Eye Hospital arranged for a sample of fluid to be taken from inside Ellie's eye and sent to the metagenomics labs at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) - the only lab in the UK officially recognised to carry out these diagnostic tests for patients, and one of only a few in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Currently, the standard method for detecting bacterial infections is by trying to grow a sample of it in a Petri dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For viruses, the most common diagnostic tool is a PCR test. These will be familiar to many from the pandemic, when millions sent off swabs in the post to confirm whether they had Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, Dr Julianne Brown, principal clinical scientist at the GOSH metagenomics service, says PCR has some drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The trouble with PCR is that you have to think of the viruses that might be causing an infection and do a separate test for each and every one," she says.

They found that human wounds took more than twice as long to heal as wounds of any of the other mammals.

To gather data on chimpanzees, which are some of our closest animal relatives, researchers observed five captive chimps at the Kumamoto Sanctuary of the Kyoto University Wildlife Research Center, which houses animals formerly used in pharmaceutical research.

The authors, a group of researchers at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, estimated that roughly 13 percent of cardiovascular deaths among 55- to 64-year-olds worldwide that year could be attributed to phthalates, which are used in food packaging, shampoo, toys and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Research on the effect of phthalates on cardiovascular disease is still emerging, but their link to metabolic risk factors like obesity suggest they could play a role in heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt; While experts agree that phthalates are harmful, they cautioned that the study relied on complex statistical modeling and a series of assumptions and estimates that make it difficult to determine how many deaths might be linked to the chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“This is an early step of trying to understand the magnitude of the problem,” said Dr. Mark Huffman, a cardiologist and a co-director of the global health center at WashU Medicine in St. Louis.

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The review of pooled data analyses of randomised controlled trial results published between 2012 and 2024 suggests that exercise can significantly reduce side-effects associated with treatment for cancer, such as heart and nerve damage and brain fog. Before this study, no such comprehensive evaluation had been published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exercise also seems to boost psychological wellbeing and overall quality of life, lending weight to its routine inclusion in treatment protocols for the disease, the study’s authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bjsports-2024-109392" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The findings of the review&lt;/a&gt;, led by Shengjing hospital of China Medical University, were published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. It included 485 associations from 80 articles, all evaluated as being of moderate to high quality. Types of exercise studied included aerobic and resistance exercise, high-intensity interval training, tai chi and yoga, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exercise significantly reduced various side-effects associated with cancer and its treatment compared with usual care or no exercise, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It lessened heart and peripheral nerve damage associated with chemotherapy, brain fog (cognitive impairment) and shortness of breath (dyspnoea).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It also changed body composition and key physiological indicators of health, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and C-reactive protein in people with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exercise also improved sleep quality, psychological wellbeing, the normal workings of the body and social interaction, while boosting overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There was evidence of high to moderate certainty that preoperative exercise reduced the risk of postoperative complications, pain, length of hospital stay, and risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In conclusion, this study reinforces the efficacy of incorporating exercise into cancer treatment protocols,” &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bjsports-2024-109392" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the researchers wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Moderate- to high-certainty evidence showed that exercise, compared with usual care or no exercise, significantly reduced cancer-related adverse events, improved body composition and biomarkers, enhanced sleep quality, psychological wellbeing, physical function, social interaction and overall QoL [quality of life].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Celene Doherty, a specialist cancer information nurse at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research UK, who was not involved with the study, said it provided further evidence that exercise could help reduce side effects from cancer treatment and improve long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“However, cancer patients go through a lot when they are diagnosed, and focusing on lifestyle changes like being more active might sound overwhelming,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s important to take things at your own pace and do activities that are right for you.” She said patients who would like advice or support on their situation should speak to their cancer team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxNYTQ1M1hPdjZlNWgtZVRkb2Z5VmJBNXAyWGxNbTdaUGJNV2JfU3ZIOWVLRW5GYXdpcEtaZWZMbFpvZDFNOUNobGhyanhwTzFhREtrWTFWTHRVM0RpS0JuS3VMOHZjUjVJcDdfX0JEUE9raVpLNGNqMjRZTXpNWVA3RTJ4b09aZjBFLWM1cWlxbVRpS3h5TUhoelFDODJ2T20yY3hLc0thRWNtSC1fQnpibF9QUXN1eTgyWFotRDBmdXRnaDYxZ081ZDhWS0dIUDg</guid></item><item><title>小RFK在访问德克萨斯州时表示，自闭症、糖尿病比麻疹更值得关注-德克萨斯论坛报 | In visit to Texas, RFK Jr. said autism, diabetes deserve more attention than measles - The Texas Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPVU8zcmZ4SVBaSVVMVXRPSnNqOVRkbl9hXzhpOE8tSHVWWnY2Z3dTRHRhQnU1UDNzdEZXdTBBVUJLOGY5eVViZXNDaWdVZXJVRzBiMHVXbzRNLUtrb3pZTEtPNVlvcjVLUHc2MzE1Vmp2Mm44VVpMMVFmckZfNHllV0VR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-story-body"&gt;

      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during a visit to Texas on Tuesday that measles deserves less attention than other chronic diseases, while downplaying the number of deaths that have occurred in the state’s historic outbreak of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;During a visit to Texas A&amp;amp;M University in College Station, Kennedy said that Europe’s measles deaths are higher than the U.S.’ “four deaths in 20 years,” two of whom were Texas children this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He also said more attention should be focused on chronic conditions like diabetes, as well as autism, which Kennedy has previously linked to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. The scientific community has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6768751/"&gt;widely debunked the theory&lt;/a&gt;, asserting the vaccine does not cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;

  &lt;/article&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Every child who gets measles gets a headline,” Kennedy said during the visit alongside Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. “When I was kid, there were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html#:~:text=Pre%2Dvaccine%20era&amp;amp;text=A%20vaccine%20became%20available%20in,States%20were%20infected%20each%20year"&gt;2 million measles cases&lt;/a&gt; a year and nobody wrote about them.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Over the last few months, Kennedy has been criticized for his response to the measles outbreak, which has been largely centered in Texas. He has questioned the role measles had in the deaths of three individuals confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control this year. He has praised private medical providers who have used alternative treatment methods on measles patients, to ease some symptoms including vitamin A and budesonide, an inhaled steroid typically used for asthma but does not “cure” measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Public health officials have repeatedly said that two doses of the MMR vaccine is the most effective way to prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He stressed on Tuesday that his agency has to take care of Texans who want to vaccinate, but also Texans who do not.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We have to talk to those people, too,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Kennedy stressed the federal support he’s sending to Texas, which has footed the bill so far to try to contain the outbreak through testing and vaccination. So far, the effort has cost the state more than $4.5 million since the first case was detected in late January, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We’re working very closely with the governor of Texas with the public health officials in Texas. We’ve provided them enormous support from the CDC, all the support that they’ve requested for vaccines and for alternative medicine,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He also struck an optimistic note about the state of Texas’ outbreak. He said measles cases are slowing as officials are doing well to manage the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While Tuesday’s state measles update shows the number of cases slowing in Gaines County, the heart of the outbreak, areas new to the outbreak, such as El Paso, are showing a faster rise in cases. On Tuesday, El Paso had 11 new cases, a 45% increase since Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas health officials were more cautious about whether this slowing of infections could be maintained. On Tuesday the number of measles cases in Texas had risen to 663 cases in 26 counties. Of those, 87 patients had been hospitalized and two school-aged children have died since the outbreak began in January.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;"It’s too soon to say. We can really only see trends looking backwards. We’d need to see a few weeks of decline to say that it was trending downward,” said Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services. “There was a lot of travel for the Easter holiday so we’re watching to see if there is an increase in cases over the next few weeks."&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Dr. Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Houston’s Baylor College of Medicine and vocal vaccine proponent, said work remains to contain the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The numbers are still going up,” Hotez said. “This is not a time to take your foot off the gas.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Rollins said she invited Kennedy to her alma mater to see Texas A&amp;amp;M’s research, as the two agencies work on the upcoming five-year Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The report, which both secretaries said would come out this summer, is expected to be a rejection of the latest 453-page advisory report, completed under the Biden Administration, that typically informs policies on healthy eating.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Traditionally, the dietary guidelines have been a political document,” Kennedy said. “Today, we’re changing that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;During the event, Rollins ticked off Americans’ poor health metrics, including how about&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult-obesity-facts/index.html"&gt; 100 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; are obese and the rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other diet-related diseases on the rise. She also announced a second round of funding for USDA’s &lt;a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/resources/programs/marketing-assistance-specialty-crops-masc"&gt;marketing assistance for specialty crops program&lt;/a&gt;. A total of $1.3 billion is being made available to farmers who grow specialty items including fruits, vegetables, vegetable seed, mushrooms, tree nuts, nursery crops, Christmas trees and culinary and medicinal herbs and spices.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Kennedy complimented A&amp;amp;M’s commitment to providing better nutrition to the American people, after making several tour stops on the campus including a sorghum greenhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“No longer will taxpayers pay for junk food and sugary drinks for our SNAP recipients. When we talk about chronic obesity and chronic disease, especially amongst our youth and our adolescents, it hits the hardest with those who are the most food challenged,” Rollins said.&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dober says these online influencers advocating a cortisol detox are “hijacking attention” using a medicalised name to give themselves an air of legitimacy that can translate to followers, engagement, money and customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It sounds like an easy fix to whatever issues might be happening in your life to target one particular chemical [but] the framing of this as a dangerous chemical is really problematic because it’s necessary,” Dober says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-cortisol-and-can-you-have-too-much-of-it" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What is cortisol and can you have too much of it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cortisol is the body’s main stress hormone, produced by the adrenal glands, and your body usually produces the right amount of cortisol to keep you healthy. Prof Creswell Eastman, an endocrinologist and clinical professor of medicine at the University of Sydney, says cortisol is an “essential hormone for life” which regulates blood pressure and the metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cortisol levels do increase with everyday stresses – and cause blood pressure, heart rate and blood sugar levels to rise with them – but that process is actually protective to help you solve problems and overcome that source of stress, Eastman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s our physiological response to the flight and fight mechanism, ensuring that we can survive some threat to our wellbeing. That’s why we make cortisol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If someone’s adrenal glands were to be taken out and they were no longer able to produce the cortisol hormone, when they were confronted with a stress they would not be able to respond to it, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The only people who have too much cortisol have the rare Cushing’s disease – when the body makes too much cortisol – or Cushing’s syndrome, which occurs when a person takes too many &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/the-role-of-cortisol-in-the-body#medicines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;medicines that are similar to cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, Eastman says. “There’s no way you can detox from that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s no such thing as detoxing from cortisol excess.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="isnt-stress-bad" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;Isn’t stress bad?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dober says “we need a healthy ‘Goldilocks’ amount of stress to thrive and grow and to learn. As humans, we don’t want to have no stress in our lives. It’s not realistic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Chronic stress, which lasts longer than three months, does &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/sep/01/the-chronic-stress-survival-guide-how-to-live-with-the-anxiety-and-grief-you-cant-escape" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;impact health, wellbeing and immune system&lt;/a&gt;, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Stress management should be part of people’s everyday self-care, but Dober says the focus on the cortisol levels themselves is unhelpful and there are no ways to quantify them for the average person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She warns some “cortisol detox” tips being given could be harmful, especially when it is assumed the tips will work for everyone. As just one example: cold plunges or cold water immersion therapy can be dangerous for those with pre-existing heart conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-experts-recommend-instead" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What do experts recommend instead?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Karena Burke, the head of the school of psychology at the University of Wollongong, says “just focusing on cortisol reduction can be problematic, and not having enough is just as problematic as having too much”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There are aspects of the ‘detox’ process that is really great advice, but honestly the focus people should have is on changes to their lifestyle overall and sustaining those changes over time,” Burke says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It is possible to ‘feel better’ after two to three weeks on these sorts of programs, but that’s because they also focus on dietary changes, stress management techniques and factors like reducing alcohol, spending time outside in nature and on increasing social connection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If someone is feeling that they are constantly stressed, they can try techniques such as relaxation, deep breathing and journalling, or increasing their physical activity – walking outside or along the beach is just as good as going to the gym – and working on their sleep hygiene, Burke recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It is important to consult a doctor, counsellor, psychologist or another healthcare professional, especially if someone is feeling really stressed or if they are planning major lifestyle changes (including dietary changes). A professional can assist to monitor the impacts and adaptations taking place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Burke says: “We’ve all heard it before, but there are few (if any) quick fixes, and there needs to be an individualised approach taken – that may mean experimenting with different things to see what works best.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dober says if people have genuine concerns around their cortisol levels, they should see their GP or an endocrinologist, but if we are thinking about general life stress, “trying to learn how to best manage stress at different points of your life can be very, very helpful”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c92b9cce-2120-4a3c-9557-68025e8615b2" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutBlockElementV2" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="CalloutBlockComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"callout":{"description":"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;What health trend&amp;amp;nbsp;do you want examined?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","prompt":"Ask Antiviral","displayOnSensitive":true,"elementId":"c92b9cce-2120-4a3c-9557-68025e8615b2","title":"Share your experience","isNonCollapsible":false,"formFields":[{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_is_your_namepseudonym","id":"172730135","hideLabel":false,"label":"What is your name/pseudonym?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_news_story_or_health_information_being_shared_on_social_media_have_you_seen_that_youd_like_us_to_examine","id":"172730137","hideLabel":false,"label":"What news story or health information being shared on social media have you seen that you’d like us to examine","hidden":false,"type":"textarea","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"do_you_have_a_link_to_an_example_you_can_share","id":"173258657","hideLabel":false,"label":"Do you have a link to an example you can share?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldRadio","name":"can_we_publish_your_response","options":[{"label":"Yes, entirely","value":"Yes, entirely"},{"label":"Yes, but contact me first","value":"Yes, but contact me first"},{"label":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous","value":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous"},{"label":"No, this is information only","value":"No, this is information only"}],"id":"172730143","hideLabel":false,"label":"Can we publish your response?","hidden":false,"type":"radio","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"email_address","description":"Your contact details are helpful so we can contact you for more information.

In a two-session study, participants consistently reported more intense pain when they expected worse outcomes, while the benefits of expecting relief were weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects persisted even a week later, suggesting that the brain may be wired to prioritize perceived threats. The findings emphasize the importance of avoiding negative framing in clinical settings, as patient expectations significantly shape treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; How healthcare providers communicate can shape patient outcomes through expectation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stronger Nocebo Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Negative expectations increased perceived pain more than positive ones reduced it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasting Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; Nocebo effects persisted a week later, outlasting placebo responses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negative expectations can worsen perceived pain more strongly – and for longer – than positive expectations can make it feel better, according to new research. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published recently as a Reviewed Preprint in &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;, is described by the editors as valuable, with the potential for a significant impact in the field of experimental and clinical pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say the authors’ rigorous methodology to compare the magnitude and duration of placebo and nocebo effects in pain perception yields compelling evidence that nocebo responses demonstrate consistently greater strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placebo and nocebo effects refer to the power of expectation in shaping how we experience symptoms. A placebo effect occurs when a person feels better simply because they believe a treatment will help, even if it is inactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a nocebo effect is when someone feels worse because they expect a negative outcome, even without a physical cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While many studies have explored placebo and nocebo effects individually, few have directly compared the two in the same people over time,” says co-lead author Katharina Schmidt, a senior postdoc at the Department of Neurology, Center for Translational Neuro- and Behavioral Sciences (C-TNBS), University Duisburg-Essen, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We set out to determine whether negative expectations towards treatment have a stronger or longer-lasting effect on pain perception than positive ones. This is important because in clinical settings, both types of expectations can be triggered by how doctors and nurses communicate – and potentially shape patient outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schmidt served as lead author of the study alongside Angelika Kunkel, also a postdoc at C-TNBS, University Duisburg-Essen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess and compare placebo and nocebo effects, the team studied 104 healthy volunteers across two sessions one week apart. On the first day, participants were exposed to short bursts of heat pain after being led to expect either pain relief (placebo), increased pain (nocebo), or no change (control).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These expectations were created using a combination of verbal suggestions and a fake pain relief treatment – a sham nerve stimulation device that appeared real but delivered no actual relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked to rate the intensity of their pain on a scale between 0 (not painful at all) and 100 (unbearably painful).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to participants, the researchers subtly adjusted the heat stimulus to reinforce their expectations – making it less painful in the placebo condition and more painful in the nocebo condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second session, the pain stimulus was kept identical across all conditions, allowing the team to test whether expectations formed on the first day continued to shape participants’ pain perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results showed that both placebo and nocebo suggestions significantly influenced pain perception – but the nocebo effect was stronger. On the first day, participants in the nocebo condition rated their pain on average 11.3 points higher than the control condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas in the placebo condition, participants rated their pain only 4.2 lower than the control. When participants returned one week later for the second session, these patterns persisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nocebo effect remained stronger than the placebo effect: participants in the nocebo condition  reported pain ratings 8.9 points higher than the control, whereas the placebo effect was again more modest, with pain ratings just 4.6 points lower than the control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that people are more likely to expect and feel worse outcomes than better ones,” says Schmidt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It reflects a ‘better-safe-than-sorry’ strategy – humans may have evolved to be more attuned to potential threats, making negative expectations carry more weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also found that recent experience of pain had a greater impact on participants’ future responses than verbal suggestions alone. For example, those who experienced a strong placebo or nocebo effect on the first day were more likely to show the same response a week later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychological traits played a role too: people who tend to feel normal body sensations as stronger and more uncomfortable showed weaker placebo effects, while those who rated the experimenter as highly competent were more susceptible to nocebo effects – possibly because they found the negative suggestions more believable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that the study was conducted using experimental pain in healthy volunteers. Further research is needed to determine how these effects apply in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight the enduring nature of both placebo and nocebo effects in pain, with nocebo responses showing consistently greater strength over time,” says senior author Ulrike Bingel, Director of the Interdisciplinary Center for Pain Medicine and Translational Pain Research at the Department of Neurology, C-TNBS, University Duisburg-Essen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we often focus on boosting positive expectations in patients, we show that it may be just as important – if not more so – to avoid unintentionally creating negative ones, which appear to be more easily triggered.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nocebo effects can be prevented using simple, effective strategies to improve communication between patients and practitioners,” adds Bingel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Positive framing, avoiding unnecessary emphasis on side effects, and building a trusting relationship can all reduce the risk of triggering nocebo responses. In a time when cost-effectiveness in healthcare is essential, preventing nocebo effects should be a key strategy for improving treatment outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was conducted as part of the Collaborative Research Center “Treatment Expectation,” funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this pain and psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a0c78eccc9d4c3c8c6c9c5ccc4e0c5ccc9c6c5d3c3c9c5cec3c5d38ecfd2c7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;George Litchfield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;eLife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;George Litchfield – eLife&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.105753.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nocebo effects are stronger and more persistent than placebo effects in healthy individuals&lt;/a&gt;” by Katharina Schmidt et al. &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nocebo effects are stronger and more persistent than placebo effects in healthy individuals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placebo and nocebo effects illustrate the profound influence of cognitive-affective processes on symptom perception and treatment outcomes, with the potential to significantly alter responses to medical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their clinical relevance, the question of how placebo and nocebo effects differ in strength and duration remains largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this preregistered study, we used a within-subject design in 104 healthy to investigate and directly compare the magnitude and persistence of placebo and nocebo effects on experimental pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effects were assessed immediately after their induction through verbal instructions and conditioning and at a one-week follow-up. Significant placebo and nocebo effects were detected on day 1 and day 8, but nocebo effects were stronger on both test days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sustained effects after one week were primarily predicted by individuals’ experienced effects on day 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings underscore the enduring nature of placebo and nocebo effects in pain, with nocebo responses demonstrating consistently greater strength, which is consistent with an evolutionarily advantageous ‘better-safe-than-sorry’ strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights emphasise the significant impact of nocebo effects and stress the need to prioritise efforts to mitigate them in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 21:28:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFAxYkhTUUVUTVQwVVZtSU9xRllYNTAzZmJEVndHb1dtc2NpN2RBU2l3WFliRnVHQzlTNUxLWjJwZHQ3SkliUl9saUlXa3hKMERtR3VfTkxTWVZmZG5GeXlSWFgtWmFGRzRKdU40dXZiSVFoRUF0ckcw</guid></item><item><title>州卫生部门称，德克萨斯州的麻疹病例上升至663例-路透社 | Measles cases in Texas rise to 663, state health department says - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiyAFBVV95cUxQMTMzTFBaYjc3d3lST0NWNWNJcjZHWXd0STAzSmRuSlREbG03bXBLQ1FiaklIYmc5eGVmZk9CM3luWHRZbGR6MzdkZTdZeXZ2WTlyc0N0YWY0aEs1WDNYMFljU2VhTDNSTWpzNm03SnZVZ2xMMUM4a0pfd0tEQ0FYRXFUVlFuRTVlbVlUNk14RWQzMnVCSXRLNUg1T1Q5SWVyQV9SdUtOZmV6dm1DYXlWVU5fLWRDOTcxRmRWNkRLV1VBdE5ZY0Nraw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 21:25:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxQMTMzTFBaYjc3d3lST0NWNWNJcjZHWXd0STAzSmRuSlREbG03bXBLQ1FiaklIYmc5eGVmZk9CM3luWHRZbGR6MzdkZTdZeXZ2WTlyc0N0YWY0aEs1WDNYMFljU2VhTDNSTWpzNm03SnZVZ2xMMUM4a0pfd0tEQ0FYRXFUVlFuRTVlbVlUNk14RWQzMnVCSXRLNUg1T1Q5SWVyQV9SdUtOZmV6dm1DYXlWVU5fLWRDOTcxRmRWNkRLV1VBdE5ZY0Nraw</guid></item><item><title>36岁的女性，新基因编辑疗法后第4期结肠癌治愈- today.com | Woman, 36, With Stage 4 Colon Cancer Cured After New Gene-Editing Therapy - today.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNMlFRa2NVTkRxR2ZpOF9oR29NcDluM29oeEJkSkdqa0w4ajczUGdSUWZBNjNwOGo0aXEtRkY2WmM4VzdtcURjNUx1SFJsNmZrSWRuUThZZHBtQWFhSDJsaHpOejZCQnJXYVJsWDZyc0dzSndqblVDQmRJTjB2NmhBN2xQcUlEcWdIODlJ0gFUQVVfeXFMUHllQklhOV95ODBEQVdsTXlIV3R6UjZLWjFXNktoVVFhOFZUeFBQSTdEUnU0Ni1nWFNsMlhLQngtOTNqMGxNWW9EOE9MMVZoOGo4THgy?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;During Thanksgiving 2013, Emma Weston, then 23, experienced intense stomach cramps. After a blood test during her annual physical uncovered low hemoglobin levels, she underwent numerous tests and learned she had Stage 3 colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They found a softball- and golf ball-sized tumor in my colon,” Weston, 36, of Minneapolis, tells TODAY.com. “They can only say for sure that it was Stage 3 at that point, but there could have been a pretty good chance it could have already been Stage 4.” Ultimately, she was diagnosed with Stage 4 colorectal cancer, and Weston eventually ran out of treatment options. Then she learned of a clinical trial that could help her. Excited, she enrolled and underwent the therapy in late 2022 and beginning of 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-05-bd701f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-05-bd701f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-05-bd701f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-05-bd701f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-05-bd701f.jpg" alt="Emma Watson"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Since undergoing an experimental treatment, Emma Weston has had no evidence of disease and has been able to return to work and enjoying her family without worrying about being a cancer patient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Emma Weston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Two months after she completed the study, she learned some unexpected news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There was no evidence of disease. It was amazing,” she says. “My whole adult life up to that point I was pretty much a cancer patient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The treatment she received uses “CRISPR gene editing” to create an individualized treatment for Stage 4 colorectal cancer patients, as Dr. Emil Lou, the principal investigator of the clinical trial, describes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It was basically a designer type of treatment — a design for each individual patient treated in the trial,” Lou, who presented his findings at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in April, tells TODAY.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“In Emma’s case, it succeeded in eliminating any evidence of the cancer she had been dealing with for nearly a decade.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Early onset colorectal cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After Thanksgiving 2013, Weston felt exhausted and saw her doctor for a physical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I thought I was burning the candle at both ends,” she says. “After that doctor’s visit, I went back to my apartment … and crashed for 48 hours.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When she woke, her mom was “blowing up (her) phone.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“She was like, ‘I’m outside your apartment. Your doctor’s been calling me for a day trying to tell me that you need to go to the ER,’” Weston recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to her bloodwork, her hemoglobin levels were low, and she went to the emergency room, where doctors ran several tests. Finally, Weston underwent a colonoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was kind of hazy from the sedation,” she says. “The doctor undoubtedly was like, ‘Oh, yeah that’s cancer.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Tests and scans followed, and doctors identified the softball- and golf ball-sized masses and diagnosed her with Stage 3 colorectal cancer. First, she underwent surgery to remove the tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They removed most of my colon,” Weston says. “They sent in the team of oncologists to start talking to (me) about next steps, chemotherapy, obviously. And it’s intense. It’s a lot especially at that age.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-04-3b985c.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-04-3b985c.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-04-3b985c.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-04-3b985c.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-04-3b985c.jpg" alt="Emma Watson"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;After having Stage 4 cancer since 2013, Emma Weston got to a point where treatments weren't working effectively on her cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Emma Weston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She underwent nine months of chemotherapy, which eliminated much of her cancer. But because there was still a microscopic amount of cancer that had spread to her peritoneum, she was upgraded to Stage 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While Weston wasn't in remission, she was "in a good place where it wasn’t really growing fast," she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Weston took a break from treatment, but after a few months, she needed to resume again. Over the years, Weston underwent various treatments with breaks in between. She has had experimental treatments, such as a HIPEC surgery in 2016, a procedure where doctors remove tumors and then bathe the abdominal cavity with heated chemotherapy. In 2018, she started radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They’re telling me that the disease (was) growing ... not at an alarming rate, like very slowly,” she says. “Nothing was helping (or) making it shrink.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;So, she started another more intensive round of chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That led to a whole bunch of other complications because it caused a rupture in where my colon had been resected back together from the first surgery,” Weston says. “They went in and removed the rest of my colon.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For about six months, she had a temporary ileostomy to help her body heal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had already exhausted the chemo,” she says. “I was doing immunotherapy with chemotherapy for a while. Then they realized that’s not working.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eventually, she received immunotherapy every other week for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s when I’m like, ‘OK I’m out of options,’” she says. “I was waiting for a clinical trial.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When she heard about Lou’s study, it piqued her interest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It wasn’t a tough decision for anything for me to make,” Weston says. “I was really jazzed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;‘Designer’ treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cancer treatments have improved at an “extremely rapid pace,” Lou says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Immunotherapy — a type of cancer treatment that harnesses a person’s immune system to treat their cancer, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/treatment-types/immunotherapy.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; — has helped patients with certain types of metastatic cancers, such as melanoma or lung cancer. But it hasn't been as successful with patients like Emma, with advanced colorectal cancer, says Lou, a professor of medicine in the division of hematology, oncology and transplantation at the University of Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-03-8fedb3.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-03-8fedb3.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-03-8fedb3.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-03-8fedb3.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-03-8fedb3.jpg" alt="Emma Watson"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;During a break in cancer treatments, Emma Weston met her husband.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Emma Weston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In this trial, Lou and his colleagues used CRISPR, a tool that can modify the DNA of living organisms, to prevent cancer cells from evading the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;More specifically, cancer cells can create blockages that stop the immune system from attacking them. These blockages on the immune calls are also called checkpoints. This study marked the first time researchers have used CRISPR to eliminate the CISH checkpoint in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Phase I trial — meaning it is the first in humans and had the goal of showing the therapy is safe — examined 12 patients with gastrointestinal cancers, including colon and rectal cancer. Like Weston, the other 11 participants had Stage 4 colorectal cancer and had failed other treatments. This experimental therapy provided a median survival rate of 129 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study shows that this therapy safely “unleashes the immune system” without causing an overreaction, Lou explains. A highlight is Weston’s outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Achieving what is called a complete response in Emma with previously metastatic, incurable Stage 4 form of colorectal cancer was a very important finding,” he says. “The thrill that we felt on seeing (Emma's) first and subsequent scans ... we hope to replicate for many other patients in the years to come and built upon it and to devise even better strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The discovery is especially important as &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/news/colon-cancer-top-cause-death-young-people-rcna134218" target="_blank"&gt;more young people are being diagnosed with colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; and researchers are unsure about what's causing the increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Lou says he and his team are in the planning stages of how to potentially make the treatment more available in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;‘Happy to be here’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the end of 2022, doctors harvested some of Weston’s white blood cells to use as part of the treatment, allowing for the individualized part of therapy. In March 2023, she underwent five days of “intense” chemotherapy before receiving the experimental therapy via infusion. For the next month, she remained in the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Because you’ve had such intense chemo, your immune system is low,” she says. “They kept me in the hospital for a few more weeks after that just to watch.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-01-82e4d3.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-01-82e4d3.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-01-82e4d3.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-01-82e4d3.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/emma-watson-colorectal-cancer-mc-250429-01-82e4d3.jpg" alt="Emma Watson"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Emma Weston was 23 when she was diagnosed with colorectal cancer.

Her strength slowly improved, and the follow-up appointments felt promising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The first time I went back in for a scan and examination after the trial, there was immediate huge shrinkage in the main mass,” Weston says. “It essentially pretty much worked right away.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Two months after the trial, Weston had no evidence of disease. She now returns annually for scans to make sure no cancer has returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’m used to being in the hospital every other week,” she says. “It’s been amazing being able to get back to a somewhat normal lifestyle, which is something I never really got off the ground in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She’s able to work part time as an illustrator and in custom framing and conservation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Cancer sucks, but it’s not the whole journey,” she says. “There have been a couple of silver linings.

Court St., Kankakee, the contract, which expires at the close of business May 16, will not be renewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Having a preferred services agreement with Ascension St. Mary’s Hospital since May 2021, Westwood’s president, Dr. Roger Taylor, said the firm had no indication this decision was forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;The effect of this mid-May timeline, Taylor said, effectively removes St. Mary’s from being a birthing location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Taylor said when Westwood signed to be the medical group for St. Mary’s births four years ago, the hospital was performing about 200 births annually. The total was increased to an estimated 500 in following years before it settled at 350 yearly the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Riverside Medical Center, located only a couple miles west of St. Mary’s, handles the vast majority of Kankakee, Iroquois and even southeast Will County births.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;In an email response from Prime to the Daily Journal, Prime confirmed the labor and delivery practice will conclude. A Prime spokesman said there are not enough births to keep the service as a viable option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;“... But the need for maternal care has dramatically declined in our hospital while access to these services is stable within the community at neighboring hospitals,” Prime said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;The decline of births at the hospital resulted in this decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;“This has led to the difficult, but necessary decision of transitioning OB services to Riverside Hospital and suspending OB services at St. Mary’s Hospital - Kankakee,” Prime said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;The spokesman said the hospital currently sees “just 26 births a month – less than one per day – with yearly births declining by nearly one-third since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;“It is not possible to ensure the highest standards of quality care with such little volume and a service that was entirely dependent on any single physician,” the spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading__StyledHeading-sc-5jxglz-0 zdKnO"&gt;‘No hint of this coming’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Prime said all staff affected by the suspension of OB services will be offered comparable positions elsewhere within the hospital or at other Prime Illinois facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Prime said no other changes are planned at St. Mary’s at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Taylor said when Prime Healthcare acquired St. Mary’s as part of its larger purchase of other health care locations in Illinois, including St. Joseph’s Hospital in Joliet, they were informed no major changes in services would take place for at least 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;That situation was about two months ago, he said. He considers this action a significant change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Taylor said Westwood offers St. Mary’s a top-notch practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;“There was no hint of this coming,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;In a news release shared by Westwood, Taylor said the medical practice, founded in 1969, has served generations of Kankakee County women and families, delivering thousands of babies and remained a “cornerstone of women’s health in the region for 55 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Taylor said Westwood was informed in a notice of default on April 18 from Prime Healthcare, which formally acquired St. Mary’s Hospital in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;“Westwood strongly disputes the claims made in that notice and has formally communicated its disagreement,” Taylor wrote in regard to the notice of default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;“Despite this, Prime has confirmed its intent to end the agreement ... and has not committed to any continuation of funding or service agreement beyond that date,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;No formal transition plan for continuity of care has been shared, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Taylor said Prime suggested the possibility of Westwood resuming operations as an independent medical practice. Taylor said with such a limited notice and no funding, the feasibility of such a transition remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;“This is not how we envisioned the end of more than five decades of service,” he said. “We are deeply proud of what we’ve built and the care we’ve provided. But without clarity, support or time to prepare, continuing in this current environment is simply not possible. Our patients deserve better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;Regarding the potential of more births being handled at Riverside, hospital administration said they are certainly able to handle additional labor and deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;During the past three years, the number of births at Riverside has been approximately 700 per year. Prior to the pandemic, the average was more than 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;“Riverside is certainly able to take on any additional labor and delivery patients,” said Riverside Healthcare President and CEO Phil Kambic. “Whatever changes there are in the local health care services, we have the staffing in both our clinics and at the hospital to meet the community need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-xb1qmn-0 eJGKLK body-paragraph"&gt;“With the expansion last year of the insurance plans we accept, we are now an option for even more area families. Having these vital services close to home is important, and we are glad to have the highly skilled, experienced staff to provide them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Shaw Local</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 21:22:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOR0xSSEJPY3NsXzNEems5bEFuMGI1QVRSTE9oWm5pcFNMYmtadG9tY21McXl5U3ZVZkdZaWdIWS1fSDVUUWhyRlYtN0V0MFBHeUhnLU02SmxjYzdLTXdINnhETGMteG8xdk9GbmlwRmpfcmRoZjdQWURyV1czemxRYzdRNnVZNFktZ3ZUa1Zn</guid></item><item><title>新的生物标志物预测MS进展-神经科学新闻 | New Biomarker Predicts MS Progression - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTFBzVFlwMDBJMWZpd09VLTZmQVZBVVJaLWVsYzMxd1lhX0xSSVpwMm5aZkZPYm1MWWNYRTdWeWtFNVE5dWhpdy1oSFhpdmRiNnR5YjVDSXVNYk9mell4ZlQzWGhhaE1XZE93UXZSaDJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have identified a new biomarker in multiple sclerosis (MS): the thickness of the inflammatory rim surrounding brain lesions predicts how quickly and severely the disease progresses. By combining PET imaging and post-mortem brain analysis, the study showed that thicker rims lead to more aggressive brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery could enable earlier identification of patients needing intensive treatment and help assess the effectiveness of new therapies.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led at the University of Turku in Finland by Professor Laura Airas in collaboration with German and Dutch colleagues, has been published in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better targeted treatments and faster drug development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research combined PET imaging data from 114 Finnish MS patients with post-mortem brain tissue analysis from Dutch MS patients. Results show that the wider the inflammatory rim around a brain lesion is, the more aggressively the disease advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When microglial cells form a thick rim around MS lesions, their harmful activity pushes deeper into healthy brain tissue, causing irreversible damage,” says Professor Laura Airas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This discovery allows us not only to identify patients who need more aggressive treatment earlier but also to evaluate the effectiveness of new drug candidates by observing changes in lesion rims.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are expected to improve the development of treatments particularly for progressive MS, the yet undertreated form of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this multiple sclerosis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8eede1e3e3fbe0e7edeffae7e1e0fdcefbfafba0e8e7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tuomas Koivula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://utu.fi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Turku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tuomas Koivula – University of Turku&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03625-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Broad rim lesions are a new pathological and imaging biomarker for rapid disease progression in multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Laura Airas et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad rim lesions are a new pathological and imaging biomarker for rapid disease progression in multiple sclerosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current multiple sclerosis (MS) treatments reduce relapse activity but have limited impact on disease progression.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some dietary supplements are widely used to support health or reduce inflammation. However, not all supplements are suitable for everyone, especially if your goal is to lower inflammation. While certain nutrients and supplements may reduce inflammatory markers, others may have the opposite effect—raising levels of inflammatory markers or triggering an immune response that worsens inflammation. Before reaching for a new supplement, consider how it may affect &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation in your body&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kava is a plant that has been used in the Pacific Islands for thousands of years for medicinal and ritual purposes. Although rare, kava supplements have been linked to an increased risk of severe liver injuries and may increase inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to one study, the water-based ingredients of kava may cause the body to release inflammatory molecules. Although some compounds in kava may offer anti-inflammatory benefits, it can pose some risks as well. &lt;a href="https://kcampbellnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kiran Campbell, RD&lt;/a&gt; and owner of KCampbell Nutrition explains, “While the active parts of kava may be helpful for reducing inflammation, other ingredients in kava may still trigger inflammation, especially when taken in traditional preparations or for long periods.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Most adults require between 8 and 18 milligrams of iron to meet their daily needs—and the upper limit that is considered safe is 40 milligrams per day. Consuming too much iron is associated with constipation, nausea, ulcers and higher levels of inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some iron supplements can include more than the daily recommended intake, so it’s best to only take &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-to-take-iron-supplement-8637263" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;iron supplements&lt;/a&gt; if you have an identified iron deficiency. And be sure to talk to your healthcare provider for individualized advice.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is an omega-6 fatty acid supplement often used for weight and fat loss. One large analysis found that CLA reduced some inflammatory markers while significantly increasing participants levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). CRP is an inflammatory marker, with higher levels indicating more inflammation in the body. While more research is needed, early findings suggest that conjugated linoleic acid supplements can raise levels of inflammation among healthy individuals or those with normal CRP levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

High-Dose Vitamin A Supplements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-vitamin-a-and-why-do-you-need-it-11702329" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; is an essential fat-soluble vitamin, but high-dose supplementation has been linked to an increased inflammatory response. The recommended daily intake for adults ranges from 700 to 900 micrograms, and the upper limit that’s considered safe is more than 3,000 micrograms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While the amount in vitamin A supplements can vary, some include more than 3,000 micrograms per serving. If taken regularly, this could lead to some negative health effects over time. According to one analysis, high-dose vitamin A supplements may significantly raise CRP levels, suggesting worsening inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Be mindful of the amount of vitamin A in any supplements you take, and be sure to talk to your doctor for individualized advice.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly:&lt;/strong&gt; Exercise can trigger inflammation when done at a high intensity for an extended period. However, under most circumstances, the inflammatory response to exercise is temporary, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054164/habit-to-break-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;exercise can be beneficial for reducing inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the long term. Gradually incorporate exercise into your routine, with a goal of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise weekly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress:&lt;/strong&gt; Research shows lower levels of inflammatory molecules after &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7955973/is-yoga-alone-a-good-enough-form-of-exercise/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;practicing yoga&lt;/a&gt; or mindfulness &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7910926/what-is-walking-meditation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt;. One study found that the benefits of yoga on inflammatory markers are noticeable after just 10 days of practice.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291120/mediterranean-diet-for-beginners-everything-you-need-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Packed with antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, legumes and healthy fats, the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2058981/ultimate-mediterranean-diet-shopping-list/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; is primed to reduce inflammation. Research has found significant decreases in inflammatory markers with the Mediterranean diet compared to other eating patterns.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not all supplements are harmless. Taking certain supplements, especially at high dosages, may exacerbate preexisting inflammation. Always follow the directions on the label and consult your healthcare provider before starting any new supplements. Instead of supplements, consider lifestyle modifications that focus on diet, exercise and stress management to reduce inflammation.

&lt;p&gt;Uptake of the seasonal influenza vaccine has held mostly steady in recent years, but Black and Hispanic adults have seen more uptake, according to an analysis published earlier this month in&lt;em&gt; JAMA Network Open.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2832475"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The study &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;is based on responses to the 2019 and 2022 Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems surveys, which were used to create a weighted sample of 285,265 community-dwelling Medicare Advantage and Medicare Fee-for-Service enrollees aged 65 years or older.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half, 54.5%, of respondents were women. Two-thirds, 76.2%, were White; 8.0% were Black; 6.9% were Hispanic; and 4.2% were Asian, Native Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rural White adults see drop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, between 2019 and 2022, overall influenza vaccination rates for older adults increased 0.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2 to 1.1), from 76.3% to 77.0%, the authors said. For White and Asian adults, percentages remained unchanged, but Black and Hispanic adults, especially those living in rural communities, saw a significant increase in uptake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black adults with seasonal flu shots increased 7.0 percentage points (95% CI, 0.3 to 13.8) and&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Hispanic adults by 8.2 percentage points (95% CI, 0.8 to 15.5). In sharp contrast, White adults in rural areas saw uptake drop by 2 percentage points over the study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determining the reasons for these divergent changes is a high priority for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Determining the reasons for these divergent changes is a high priority for future studies,” the authors concluded. “However, these descriptive findings are important to policymakers as they make decisions about how to invest in interventions that could influence influenza vaccination rates for populations with lower rates of uptake.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Considering that in the United States, men are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db330.htm" target="_blank"&gt;four times more likely to take their own lives&lt;/a&gt; than women, the results of the Priory survey were not a big surprise. More than three-quarters (77 percent) of the survey participants acknowledged experiencing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental health-related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, 40 percent of those who admitted to mental health challenges said they had never spoken to anyone about it. This is clearly not the healthiest approach to mental health management. If someone doesn't discuss their emotional baggage, the people around them are likely to assume that everything is okay. But not every emotional health challenge requires years of therapy. Sometimes, all a man needs is a reminder that others see the best in him and value his existence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In marriage and long-term relationships, a man might — rightly or wrongly — derive much of his sense of self-worth from how his partner perceives him. In this sense, women can play an instrumental role in preserving men's confidence and self-esteem. We asked a panel of YourTango Experts to share their insight into how a woman might, with the right combination of gestures and words, help boost a man's confidence in himself and his place in the world. It's a small but important step toward helping men crash through the tough-guy stereotype and focus on their mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The 3 small gestures that quietly boost a man’s confidence, according to experts:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Be present, listen, and validate his feelings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/how-finally-built-my-self-esteem-through-complete-total-radical-acceptance" target="_blank"&gt;self-esteem is an inside job&lt;/a&gt;. However, most men struggle with insecurity to some extent, and women can do small, basic things to help.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All men (not just your romantic partner):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look them straight in the eyes when they are talking and listen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/to-fall-love-with-partner-ask-these-questions"&gt;Ask them questions&lt;/a&gt; that get to the facts to inquire how they are feeling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allow them to feel however they want with compassion, not criticism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When they say something you think is smart, let them know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laugh at their jokes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let them know you don’t blame them personally for global misogyny.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For your romantic partner:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tell him what personality trait you find most attractive about him (especially if you have been together for a while).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tell him about those unexpected moments when you think he looks hot (after a workout, in the shower, dressed for work).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laugh with him about the things about him that drive you crazy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask him out on a date you know he will like.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tell him how proud you are of him and that you are his partner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take seriously events in his life that are important to him, even if they don’t interest you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/why-cuddling-most-underrated-human-activity" target="_blank"&gt;Cuddle with him&lt;/a&gt; at night.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://goodmenproject.com/author/tom-matlack/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom Matlack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, writer, speaker, and men's health advocate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/things-men-want-from-women-wont-ask-for"&gt;10 Things Men Really Want From Women (But Won't Ask For), According To Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

At other times, I think it's as simple as just telling them the truth about &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/words-way-more-important-than-i-love-you" target="_blank"&gt;how thankful you are&lt;/a&gt; that they are in your life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that, as women, we sometimes forget that men also need acknowledgment. I think we sometimes take our men for granted, and yet, the truth is, our lives are richer for having them in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.mimiwhittaker.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mimi Whittaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, intuitive life coach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/what-men-want-more-love-and-how-give-it-them"&gt;The Secret Thing Men Want More Than Love (And How To Give It To Them)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Give him sincere, specific compliments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe heartfelt compliments are a strong confidence booster. &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/compliments-men-wish-wives-give-more-often" target="_blank"&gt;Sincere and specific compliments&lt;/a&gt; can have a profound impact on a man's confidence.

A recent study published in the journal &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=76202X1587086&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs44298-024-00079-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.express.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworld%2F2048405%2Fdeadly-disease-spread-insect-pandemic" rel="nofollow"&gt;npj Viruses&lt;/a&gt; said: “Unlike other &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/life-style/health/1892166/mosquito-warning-diseases-malaria-europe"&gt;mosquito-borne diseases,&lt;/a&gt; humans infected with YFV exhibit heightened viremia and are efficiently amplifying hosts, allowing for inter-human transmission by mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This makes YFV particularly capable of sparking urban epidemics, as infected people can efficiently infect mosquitoes that bite them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international group of scientists added that while yellow fever has not yet been transmitted to the Asia-Pacific region the risk is higher than ever with studies suggesting an “expansion”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis" class="ovp-primis-h251"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper states: "A YF pandemic in today’s world would cause a devastating public health crisis that, because of the much higher lethality, would make the Covid-19 pandemic pale by comparison."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors added: “The concern that YFV will spread to the Asia Pacific region that Carter raised 100 years ago in his treatise on the subject remains equally pressing today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Indeed, we would argue that the likelihood of such a catastrophe could be even higher now than it was in Carter’s time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial symptoms of yellow fever appear three-six days after exposure.

However, in severe cases, the disease can cause jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, abdominal pain, and bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="wunderkind-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bleeding can also occur from the mouth, nose, eyes, or stomach, WHO warns that about 15% of people will enter this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of the patients who enter the "toxic phase" die within seven-10 days, WHO figures suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus is not spread from person-to-person through coughing, sneezing, or touching. In forested areas, yellow fever virus primarily circulates between forest-dwelling mosquitoes and non-human primates, such as monkeys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellow fever is believed to infect around 200,000 people each year and to kill 30,000 of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination is the best way of preventing yellow fever. The vaccine provides immunity within 10 days for 80–100% of people vaccinated, and within 30 days for more than 99% of people vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 19:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNREJzVzJyWkpFX0MyZnZCYUhJY1hEX05Cckh3eTVmdVRmRVpiMWtodlg1MkdhMU1QeC1TeC04SU4xRVpBRWRlOWNCa2Y1NU9fVENmNndvemdiTU1zSXJxR3I5c0RGanU4and2NFY3MUZrOWR1elJsVGxLZW41NFhqa2RxcEVYZnhzM0HSAY8BQVVfeXFMTlRwRkFRS3VMRkNIeWxON1UwSmlVZDV6d09wckJ0dXlXZzZpd1NRZTZsYmxBeWF6S21kdkhWSzd6V2h3cHFLQnVGekZJOUlOdVpxSkc4VU5aTnhfTHRVZTQtTmJJUVFJR2EyMGRLRDZvVGZ5ZXp0MEMySjg2eVoxcHZNTUtrT0JsSWNXMG5YRzg</guid></item><item><title>减肥： Ozempic脚，口中不寻常的GLP-1副作用-健康线 | Weight Loss: Ozempic Feet, Mouth Among Unusual GLP-1 Side Effects - Healthline</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxOZzBENVU2VGJSRVNOVHlqQVYxc3A5WUNhcjJ4b01aU2RhVHFhNnEtWmtkQWNKdDZHS21lSTcyczNyNEJxbndQLWV1NjRQcVNab2ZmN21tYkNXa0w0cXdVZV9OUHpsSmcyWnVOdTBpcFpQVVFOcl93UkUxNVV6U01NOW5RU0JQY2JtendHejVPazUxR2hq?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ozempic-foot-1296x728-header.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ozempic-foot-1296x728-header.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ozempic-foot-1296x728-header.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ozempic-foot-1296x728-header.jpg" alt="Bare feet dangling over water" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-1dn5h5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healthline.com%2Fhealth-news%2Fozempic-mouth-feet-unusual-side-effects-glp-1-drugs&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F04%2Fozempic-foot-1296x728-header.jpg&amp;amp;description=Weight%20Loss%3A%20Ozempic%20Feet%2C%20Mouth%20Among%20Unusual%20GLP-1%20Side%20Effects" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ozempic-foot-1296x728-header.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-1dutyn6"&gt;Recent anecdotal reports have highlighted strange side effects of GLP-1 medications used for weight loss like “Ozempic mouth” and “Ozempic feet.” Elena Popova/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Ozempic feet” and “Ozempic mouth” are the latest reported cosmetic side effects from GLP-1 medications used for weight loss.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts say wrinkles and sagging skin can result from rapid weight loss due to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; loss of fat and muscle mass in certain areas of the body.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can minimize some of these effects by increasing protein in your diet and incorporating resistance training into your exercise routine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can add “Ozempic feet” and “Ozempic mouth” to the growing list of nicknames for strange and unusual side effects from popular GLP-1 medications used for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports on social media and elsewhere have been highlighting “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/20/health/ozempic-feet-gnarly-side-effect-of-weight-loss-drug-exhibited-by-some-celebs-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Ozempic feet&lt;/a&gt;,” a GLP-1 side effect resulting in excessively wrinkled feet. A recent &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIE_qTJzHcz/?igsh=bHdmdmthd3lpaHE5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt; of a barefoot Sharon Osbourne posted on Instagram set off a flurry of publicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, “&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/ozempic-face-what-is-it-and-what-can-you-do-about-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Ozempic face&lt;/a&gt;” describes the general hollowing of the face and an increase of wrinkles as people lose weight. There’s also the “&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/ozempic-what-to-know-about-this-side-effect-you-may-experience-while-taking-weight-loss-drugs#What-Is-Ozempic-Butt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Ozempic butt&lt;/a&gt;” phenomenon, which occurs when sagging skin becomes pronounced around the buttocks as a person loses weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the drug Ozempic is most often pegged to these nicknames, the side effects can also be present with other injectable weight loss medications such as Wegovy, Zepbound, and Mounjaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the side effects aren’t a result of the medications themselves, but rather, are byproducts of rapid weight loss. They also note that these side effects are cosmetic and usually not a danger to a person’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, these effects can be minimized through modifications in diet and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-exercise-for-weight-loss" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;. People could also try to lose weight at a slower pace to help reduce some of these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You need a team to follow you and help you,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/Dan%20Azagury" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Dan Azagury&lt;/a&gt;, MD, FACS, an associate professor of surgery and the section chief of Minimally Invasive and Bariatric Surgery at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Get some support and do this in the right way,” he told Healthline. “This is not a sprint. Slow and steady wins this race.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say wrinkles and sagging skin may sometimes occur after weight loss because of the loss of fat and the reduction in muscle mass throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any kind of significant weight loss can have a dramatic change in body habitus and appearance,” said &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a general surgeon, bariatric surgeon, and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see the same kind of changes after surgical weight loss as well, so it is more an effect of weight loss, rather than directly because of the medication,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nidhi.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Nidhi Pandya&lt;/a&gt;, an Ayurvedic doctor, holistic practitioner, and author of the book “&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/773404/your-body-already-knows-by-nidhi-pandya/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Your Body Already Knows&lt;/a&gt;,” said people should know the benefits and downsides of weight loss medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While these drugs are highly effective for lowering appetite and improving glycemic control, they also accelerate weight loss in a way that can have systemic consequences,” Pandya told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She lists some of the side effects as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;loss of lean body mass&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;altered gut microbiome&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;micronutrient deficiencies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;impaired tissue repair&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My advice is to approach these medications as serious metabolic interventions, to be used after a thoughtful evaluation of risks and benefits,” said Pandya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kristinkirkpatrick.com/meet-kristin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Kristin Kirkpatrick&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, the president of KAK Consulting and a dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic Department of Wellness &amp;amp; Preventive Medicine in Ohio, agreed it’s important to plan your weight loss journey carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yes, side effects of rapid weight loss can and do happen, but working with a healthcare provider and focusing on going above and beyond just taking the shot can help,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say you can counter these natural side effects through dedicated practices involving diet and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many of these side effects can be minimized by supporting the body’s physiology and metabolism with targeted lifestyle strategies,” said Pandya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among her suggestions are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;consuming at least 1 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight per day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;limiting snacks and meal frequency&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;starting meals with &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/8-fermented-foods" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; and high fiber vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;stress management through techniques such as mindfulness and breath work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;structured sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While [these drugs] are powerful pharmacologic tools, the bedrock of metabolic health remains in intelligent, science-backed lifestyle strategies that support the body’s natural signaling and repair mechanisms,” said Pandya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tell my patients that when you are on these drugs you have to get nutritional bang for every bite,” said Kirkpatrick. “The mechanism of these drugs leads to a reduced intake of food and, therefore, you can’t really afford to consume foods that provide no nutritional benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardio is great and has many benefits, but resistance training can specifically help with muscle mass,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali noted it’s important to remember the purpose of weight loss programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People taking medication for weight loss or even undergoing surgery should realize the goal is to achieve &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-should-i-weigh" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;a healthy weight&lt;/a&gt; to minimize obesity-related health conditions and achieve a normal lifespan,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing weight is inherently a difficult task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the body may need to store fat for various physiological reasons, including organ protection, hormone regulation, and nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azagury noted that the human body is also programmed to retain some fat in case of food shortages. “Your body is designed to avoid weight loss,” he said. “You’re fighting tens of thousands of years of evolution when you try to lose weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that modern techniques, such as &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/obesity/bariatric-surgery" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;bariatric surgery&lt;/a&gt; and new weight loss medications, can make weight reduction a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no hierarchy in how we lose weight,” Azagury said. “There is no better or worse way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/whats-the-difference-between-ozempic-wegovy-mounjaro-and-zepbound#insurance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Ozempic and Wegovy&lt;/a&gt;

Ozempic is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, while Wegovy is approved for weight loss and management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/whats-the-difference-between-ozempic-wegovy-mounjaro-and-zepbound#Mounjaro-and-Zepbound-Tirzepatide-What-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Mounjaro and Zepbound&lt;/a&gt; are injectable drugs that contain the active ingredient trizepatide. The FDA approves Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes, while Zepbound is used for weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these drugs work in the same basic way by suppressing a person’s appetite. They do have some potential side effects. Some of the more common are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;nausea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;constipation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;abdominal pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These medications have been shown in &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/mounjaro-superior-to-ozempic-for-blood-sugar-and-weight-loss-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to help people with obesity and other weight management issues lose weight effectively.

This has sparked renewed interest in a largely untapped yet promising resource: Nigeria’s indigenous food plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These plants – including their leaves, seeds, tubers, and fruits – are loaded with bioactive compounds. Laboratory studies show that many of these natural substances have the potential to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/many-plant-species-show-great-promise-in-fight-against-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;slow or even halt&lt;/a&gt; tumor growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence suggests that these plants, long consumed as part of the traditional diet, could be developed as low-cost, complementary tools in the nation’s fight against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plants-that-prevent-or-halt-cancer"&gt;Plants that prevent or halt cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have catalogued dozens of edible Nigerian species with measurable &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-is-the-next-frontier-in-cancer-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-cancer activity&lt;/a&gt;, but nine stand out for the breadth of experimental data already available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spondias mombin&lt;/em&gt; (hog plum) contains the flavonoid quercetin along with carotenoids that trigger apoptosis – the “self-destruct” program in malignant cells – while simultaneously tamping down inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xanthosoma sagittifolium&lt;/em&gt;, a cocoyam cultivated widely in the humid south, produces tannins and other phenolics that cause leukemia cells to stall in the cell-cycle, blocking proliferation and reducing the formation of new blood vessels that tumors need in order to expand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil palm (&lt;em&gt;Elaeis guineensis&lt;/em&gt;) is often maligned for ecological reasons, yet its vitamin-E–rich tocotrienols are potent antioxidants; in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-based-diet-improves-health-in-women-with-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; models they lower cell viability and force cells into arrest, nudging them toward death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Irvingia gabonensis&lt;/em&gt;, the African bush mango, supplies gallotannins that regulate metabolic pathways linked to tumorigenesis and stimulate immune surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-powerful-cancer-fighting-plant-compounds"&gt;Powerful cancer-fighting plant compounds &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Allium cepa&lt;/em&gt;, the humble onion, is packed with organosulphur compounds as well as flavonoids that up-regulate detoxification enzymes, mop up DNA-damaging free radicals and may even help reverse multidrug resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blighia sapida&lt;/em&gt; (ackee) fruit, famous for its culinary role in Caribbean cuisine, also grows in Nigeria; laboratory work shows its flavonoids can hamper the ERK5 pathway, a key driver of aggressive breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dioscorea dumetorum&lt;/em&gt;, a wild yam, synthesizes diosgenin – long prized in the pharmaceutical industry as a raw material for steroid hormones – which shuts off the pro-survival NF-κB and MAPK cascades in cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/04/29123423/plants_anti-cancer-properties_nigeria_credit-google-photos_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/04/29123432/plants_anti-cancer-properties_nigeria_credit-google-photos_1s.webp" alt="Selected edible Nigerian plants with anti-cancer properties.

Angiogenesis – the sprouting of new blood vessels that feed a tumor – is another frequent target. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compounds from cocoyam, yam and hog plum have been shown to lower levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and related signals, choking off the nutrient supply to nascent tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory enzymes (COX-2, iNOS) and reactive oxygen species are suppressed as well, reducing the chronic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fasting-helps-the-body-fight-inflammation-and-chronic-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and oxidative stress that often initiate or accelerate malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bridging-tradition-and-modern-oncology"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bridging tradition and modern oncology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While pre-clinical data are encouraging, several hurdles must be cleared before Nigerian food plants can take their place beside paclitaxel or cisplatin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bioactive composition varies by soil type, rainfall pattern and harvest time; rigorous agronomic studies are needed to standardize cultivation and extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dosage, toxicity and potential interactions with conventional drugs remain largely untested in humans. Well-designed clinical trials – randomized, placebo-controlled and sufficiently powered – are essential if these botanicals are to earn a formal role in oncology clinics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is the disconnect between traditional knowledge holders and laboratory scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethnobotanical surveys can help bridge that gap, ensuring that leads chosen for development reflect community practices and dietary realities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public-health campaigns, meanwhile, could educate physicians, pharmacists, and patients about the evidence base for plant-derived adjuncts, avoiding unsubstantiated claims while highlighting genuine benefits such as reduced side-effects or improved &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/active-aging-physical-activity-has-a-direct-impact-on-life-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;quality of life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cost-effective-renewable-treatments"&gt;Cost-effective, renewable treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these hurdles are overcome, the payoff could be substantial. Many of the plants grow wild or are already farmed for food, implying a local, renewable supply chain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracts could be formulated as teas, capsules or functional foods, lowering barriers to access in rural areas where oncology centers are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining plant-based agents with lower doses of chemotherapy or radiation might retain efficacy while mitigating nausea, hair loss, and myelosuppression – side-effects that often deter patients from completing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fighting-cancer-with-plants-future-research"&gt;Fighting cancer with plants: Future research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should prioritize mapping the full chemoprofile of each candidate plant. This should also include identifying synergistic combinations and unravelling pharmacokinetics in vivo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genomic and metabolomic tools can accelerate the discovery of lead molecules, while &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-nanotechnology-is-fighting-microplastic-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nanotechnology&lt;/a&gt; may enhance their bioavailability. Collaboration between Nigerian universities, pharmaceutical firms, and international cancer institutes will be vital to secure funding and regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Nigeria’s indigenous food plants harbor a rich arsenal of anticancer phytochemicals that attack tumours through multiple, complementary pathways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrated with evidence-based medicine, these botanicals could broaden the therapeutic arsenal, reduce treatment costs and bring culturally familiar options to patients. Harnessing the plants may demand careful science, but the potential rewards will justify the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.xiahepublishing.com/2835-6357/FIM-2024-00042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Future Integrative Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 19:40:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQUXBlVkZ0ZnhtcnRRZGVEX3ozNDZnR084aTd6eGM2UHlES3ctNXQ3eFRHemR3dFlMLUZOMkpOM3JVSGhLWkF2V0lOc2FEMFBmbUpTdkNEcVBubnlBUVpYNzB6aE9QSG5QZGsyVzhPbm92bG5DbUJEVTdmeTFxTW84MkhGOVdSTXVIcjVVTGZ3</guid></item><item><title>玛丽亚·凯瑟琳·福特纳讣告-阿克伦灯塔杂志 | Maria Catherine Fortner Obituary - Akron Beacon Journal</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYkFVX3lxTE5ibm9yQURUSnNHUkNwNzNLOE1sWUFuQWFmSWdnbk5YNE1yQzhtNTRtSEo5RWhDbE9CMENKVUhwN0ZpNEw5X0lZc01OX19CZTVBbHBLYzlkcEFqWFZtMGZWQTJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-1f2n0xl"&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Maria Catherine Fortner was taken home to the Lord on Friday, April 25, 2025. Her heart took its last beat while she was surrounded by her loving family and Father Joe Robinson as they finished praying The Rosary.  She passed as the hour hit 5:00 p.m.; it was truly “5:00 somewhere”, and she wanted to be in paradise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Maria was born on October 6, 1992, and for 32 years, she was an incredible daughter, sister, granddaughter, aunt, Godmother, and friend to all. She graduated from Wadsworth High School in 2011 and The Ohio State University in 2015, then finished her education with a Master of Anesthesia from Case Western Reserve University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Maria will be remembered for her unique, beautiful, curly hair, smile, and laugh that would light up a room. She was a kind, generous, and caring person who always put others first. Her authentic love for Ohio State, spending time at her favorite place, Lake Buckhorn, shopping, antiques, travel, spending time with her wonderful friends, and love for dolphins will always be remembered. She was gifted in her job as an anesthetist, as she worked and lived in Columbus. She not only worked with patients, but she taught for a semester as a professor in Anesthesia as well. Maria was an enthusiastic reader, absolutely adored classic Disney movies, and was an avid Harry Potter fan. She loved the thrill of roller coasters and amusement parks, especially visiting Disney and Universal Studios. Her taste in music, good food, and creative charcuterie boards will always be remembered. She truly knew how to have fun and enjoy life. Maria was very compassionate and had the gift of making everyone feel loved. Knowing how to enjoy life and love others are qualities we will always strive to uphold and never forget. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Maria is survived by her parents, Dale &amp;amp; Debbie Fortner; sisters, Sarah (Dan), Olivia (boyfriend, Alex), Sophia, and Julia (boyfriend, Aaron); Godson/nephew, Lincoln; grandparents, Sally and Sam Tomlinson, along with countless uncles, aunts, cousins, and friends. Maria will also be deeply missed by the family dogs, Rambo and Kava. She was welcomed into heaven by her grandparents, Lillian &amp;amp; Dick Fortner, eight great-grandparents &amp;amp; dog Romeo, all of who she loved and adored. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;The family would like to thank the University Hospital medical team, who did everything possible to heal Maria and prolong her life. She left this world cancer-free with a successful bone marrow transplant from her sister, Olivia. Complications following the cancer treatments took her into God's arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Calling Hours will be on Friday, May 2nd, from 1-3 and 5-8 at The Chapel in Wadsworth, Saturday, May 3rd, from 10-noon at Hillard Rospert Funeral Home with a funeral mass at 1:00 pm at Sacred Heart Parish in Wadsworth.   A private burial will be at a later date.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;In lieu of flowers, the family asks that you donate to the Maria Fortner Scholarship Fund (at Huntington Bank) for a deserving high school senior or the Leukemia &amp;amp; Lymphoma Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Hilliard-Rospert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;(330-334-1501)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.HilliardRospert.com"&gt;www.HilliardRospert.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-1yjvs5a"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-container css-1waw91g"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiGrid-root MuiGrid-item MuiGrid-grid-xs-12 css-1nq6xvs"&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-1xsp3sk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Posted online on April 29, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-1ncapy4 css-9l3uo3"&gt;Published in Akron Beacon Journal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Akron Beacon Journal</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 19:10:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYkFVX3lxTE5ibm9yQURUSnNHUkNwNzNLOE1sWUFuQWFmSWdnbk5YNE1yQzhtNTRtSEo5RWhDbE9CMENKVUhwN0ZpNEw5X0lZc01OX19CZTVBbHBLYzlkcEFqWFZtMGZWQTJn</guid></item><item><title>发现有助于一些患者避免手术的实验性抗癌药物-《华盛顿邮报》 | Experimental cancer drugs found to help some patients avoid surgery - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPSHdvTzZjOGMzcWJaYU5aUXVxRlM1bmliVmRiWFpveGZuc01xd2xMYWhzcTdRd1pwWlY1OFlCOVBWZnVFcWdILTZnVWQ1LVVMZ0c3b1YwX0FIMWlWc2dIZHpZcWZkdV9Cc1JFOVlJMTNUVm03SklCM2Y1dEU4bWhqRmJaQ2JqY2lQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PK2ITMOXTVDGBOZWS5UMP2PL4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The results from an ambitious cancer study are giving hope that immunotherapy drugs alone can treat some gastrointestinal tumors, eliminating the need for severe, life-altering surgeries and other harsh therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YUKQMWDLJVEM7JQOAVSJH6FPHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For as long as cancer treatment has existed, “cutting it out has been the best way to cure it,” said Luis Diaz, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and one of the co-leaders of the study, along with Andrea Cercek, also a gastrointestinal&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;medical oncologist with MSK. “This is a complete paradigm shift.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O3QPFYKDHRG73GEH3IOZ26JVWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The approach “gives patients more agency in determining how they want to approach their treatment based on chances of survivorship, but also quality of life and side effects,” said Karen Knudsen, CEO of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at the University of California at San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CVYBZ526X5CLRA555W5CZCXUME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study enrolled 103 patients with hard tumors from gastrointestinal cancers affecting organs such as the stomach, bladder and intestines that normally would be treated with surgery. All had tumors with mutations, called mismatch repair deficiencies, that prevent cells from fixing DNA damage. These types of mutations occur in 2 to 3 percent of all cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5XFG3DHGJRDLZHAL5PCRQ576X4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Eighty percent of patients treated with an immunotherapy drug, dostarlimab, did not require chemotherapy, radiation or surgery, including organ removal, the trial found. That included all 49 patients with rectal cancers, who saw their tumors disappear completely after six months of treatment, with no recurrence at five years. Thirty-five of 54 patients with tumors in places such as the colon, bladder, esophagus and stomach saw their cancer disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JFMKDAVUN5F5DNL7QYAUPSYVXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Diaz and his team shared the results Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2404512" target="_blank"&gt;published them&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/06/08/cancer-drug-trial/" target="_blank"&gt;The trial results build on the groundbreaking first phase of the study&lt;/a&gt;, which debuted at the same conference in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XRQLPCF2UBDMTPRDTFRWEP7JYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During Phase 1, which was conducted in 2020, a tiny sample of 14 patients with early-stage rectal cancer were given dostarlimab. The tumors in all 14 patients vanished after six months of the experimental treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TWQO2PDKFJHBRDX4DM5SADCOEQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The second phase of the trial added patients with solid, non-rectal tumors. Patients received a 500-milligram dose of dostarlimab intravenously every three weeks, for a total of nine treatments.

&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that Parkinson’s often is not diagnosed until the disease is in its later stages, and its hallmark symptoms, like tremor and walking problems, are more evident. By that time, however, the brain is often irreversibly damaged, per the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this novel test, which measures a protein called alpha-synuclein that is misfolded in Parkinson’s patients, is showing promise for helping reliably diagnose Parkinson’s disease — even in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the future it could be used to monitor disease progression, guide treatment decisions, and accelerate the development of new drugs,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test uses samples of CSF, collected via a spinal tap, to directly test misfolded alpha-synuclein — a molecular hallmark of Parkinson’s and related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists detailed their findings in “&lt;a href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-025-00229-z"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alpha-synuclein misfolding as fluid biomarker for Parkinson’s disease measured with the iRS platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” a study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Use of new technique may allow Parkinson’s diagnosis at early stage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-causes-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s is caused&lt;/a&gt; by a progressive loss of the brain’s dopaminergic neurons, which are the nerve cells that produce dopamine, a signaling molecule essential for motor control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-tests-diagnosis/"&gt;Diagnosing&lt;/a&gt; the condition mainly relies on the onset of &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, including slowness of movement, medically known as bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremors, and postural instability. Still, by the time of symptom onset, the disease is often advanced, with more than half of the dopaminergic neurons already lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is an unmet medical need for fluid biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy based on a biological classification,” the researchers wrote. The team noted that such biomarkers already have been established for &lt;a href="https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/what-is-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, which also is marked by progressive neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Parkinson’s patients, the misfolding of the protein alpha-synuclein into toxic clumps called Lewy bodies is thought to interfere with the function of dopaminergic neurons and contribute to their death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klaus Gerwert, PhD, a study lead, noted that “these misfoldings make the protein sticky, leading to the formation of larger complexes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those complexes are known as oligomers, according to Gerwert, founding and managing director at the Center for Protein Diagnostics at Ruhr University Bochum (PRODI) in Germany, and CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.beta-sense.de/en/"&gt;Betasense&lt;/a&gt;, a university spinoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The oligomers then produce long fibrillar filaments and cause the aggregation of these filaments into macroscopically large Lewy bodies in the brain,” Gerwaert said in a &lt;a href="https://news.rub.de/english/press-releases/2025-04-25-biophysics-new-body-fluid-biomarker-parkinsons-disease-discovered"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt; on the team’s discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers from PRODI and Betasense found that measuring misfolded alpha-synuclein in the CSF — using this new technique — can aid in reliably diagnosing Parkinson’s at an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique is based on a patented immuno-infrared sensor (iRS) platform technology from Betasense, which can directly detect folded versus misfolded alpha-synuclein in bodily fluids that absorb different wavelengths of light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iRS technology has already been applied to Alzheimer’s, which is characterized by the misfolding of amyloid-beta in the brain. A &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12745"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showed it was able to assess the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia at a later stage with high accuracy, up to 17 years before diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have now transferred this approach to Parkinson’s for the misfolding of [alpha-synuclein],” Gerwert said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Test for Parkinson’s disease uses same approach as one for Alzheimer’s&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team used the iRS platform to test 134 CSF samples. The discovery group involved 59 individuals, of whom 17 were diagnosed with Parkinson’s. The remaining 42 people, who had no signs of neurodegenerative diseases, served as controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The validation group consisted of 75 individuals, 40 of whom had Parkinson’s and five with &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/types-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;multiple system atrophy&lt;/a&gt; (MSA), a neurodegenerative disorder with similar symptoms to Parkinson’s. Because misfolding of alpha-synuclein is also known to occur in MSA, both Parkinson’s and MSA patients were called the misfolding-positive group. All other participants were grouped as one disease control. That group comprised those with corticobasal degeneration, frontotemporal dementia, and progressive supranuclear palsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the team demonstrated that the ratio of two iRS wavelengths of light, 1656.0 to 1623.5 per cm, significantly distinguished between folded and misfolded alpha-synuclein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, using this ratio, the researchers found the ability to distinguish Parkinson’s/MSA patients from controls was 90% in the discovery group and 86% in the validation group. When both datasets were combined, the classification accuracy was 90%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;The structure-based biomarker … now enables a biological classification for [Parkinson’s disease] for timely identification and intervention, potentially slowing the disease progression and improving patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the levels of the wavelength ratio, the participants were then grouped again. One group comprised individuals with high levels of misfolded alpha-synuclein, indicating they likely had Parkinson’s or MSA. The other had those with low levels, who did not show signs of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When comparing just these two groups, the test identified Parkinson’s or MSA with 95% accuracy. It correctly detected 97% of people who had the disease (sensitivity) and correctly identified 92% of people who did not have it (specificity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iRS readings that fell between these two levels, referred to as the intermediate group, reflected a continuum of misfolding between a healthy and diseased state. These individuals may have an elevated risk of developing diseases related to alpha-synuclein misfolding compared with unaffected individuals, the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The structure-based biomarker, which is already established for Alzheimer’s, now enables a biological classification for [Parkinson’s disease] for timely identification and intervention, potentially slowing the disease progression and improving patient outcomes,” the researchers wrote in detailing the study’s impact.&lt;/p&gt;

After two months, almost everyone’s muscles were larger, stronger and more powerful than at the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TIP72HT3LFDKBPVF2BFPRRNRHI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The magnitude of the changes proved to be similar among men and women and those who’d lifted to failure and those who’d left a few reps in reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XN2OIOM2WBFUXLPJTROQVXQZQI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You need to put in some effort,” Schoenfeld said. But you don’t need to lift until your muscles are completely exhausted to show significant gains in strength and size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WAGYVORZMNHVDAA6WOFMSF2ZSE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You also don’t need to follow this study’s regimen precisely, he said. “There’s nothing special” about these particular exercises, in this order. Substitute &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-science-original/" target="_blank"&gt;body weight exercises&lt;/a&gt; like pull-ups or push-ups for some of the exercises, he said, or ask a trainer at your gym to show you the machines there that work the shoulders, biceps, back, core and legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GGCAFJTY4JHIXG46ZPSOITET2E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re new to lifting, the trainer could be especially useful, Schoenfeld added, to teach you proper form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4TAB4RKC6JGQ3KR6LXADGJGUDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the key to lifting for muscle health will always be simple consistency, he said. Show up twice a week and challenge your muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z2J4I3RS65HDXI7IRQSI3JGRHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s unlikely, based on this study, that most of us need more than two, short weight workouts a week, he continued, unless our goal is to become swole.

Leave at least one day between each session, but otherwise Tuesdays and Thursdays, or Fridays and Mondays, or Sundays and Wednesdays, or whatever works for you should be fine, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PZAGHS5YSVFEVP3GMSGLBEYB74" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This study was relatively short-term, lasting only eight weeks, and involved mostly healthy adults. It’s “quite likely” but not certain that the results apply equally to older people and other groups, Schoenfeld said, and that the benefits continue past two months.

(CREDIT: CC BY-SA 4.0)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping weight off during middle age is not easy. As the years pass, many people—especially men—find themselves gaining stubborn belly fat. Now, researchers have uncovered key reasons why this happens, offering hope for new ways to combat age-related weight gain and metabolic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Middle Age Unlocks Fat Cell Growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In new research published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj0430" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Science;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, scientists at City of Hope and &lt;a href="https://www.ucla.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UCLA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt; revealed that aging triggers a hidden switch in your body’s fat-making system. Qiong (Annabel) Wang, Ph.D., an associate professor at &lt;a href="https://www.cityofhope.org/research/riggs-institute" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:City of Hope’s Arthur Riggs Diabetes &amp;amp; Metabolism Research Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;City of Hope’s Arthur Riggs Diabetes &amp;amp; Metabolism Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, explained that aging awakens a new type of adult stem cell that fuels fat production around your abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People often lose muscle and gain body fat as they age—even when their body weight remains the same,” Wang said. Her team focused on white adipose tissue, or WAT, the primary kind of fat tissue that grows with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Adipose tissue, which contains fat cells (shown red-yellow in this scanning electron micrograph). (CREDIT: STEVE GSCHMEISSNER/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/GETTY IMAGES)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team suspected that more was happening than just the enlargement of existing fat cells. They proposed that the body might be creating an entirely new batch of fat cells as you age, especially around the belly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this, Wang and her colleagues transplanted adipocyte progenitor cells, or APCs, from both young and middle-aged mice into young mice. They observed that APCs from older mice quickly produced a flood of new &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/crispr-transforms-ordinary-fat-cells-into-cancer-killing-machines/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fat cells;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fat cells&lt;/a&gt;, while APCs from young mice barely generated any new cells even when placed into older bodies. This proved that aging, not environment, unlocked a powerful ability in these cells to make fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A New Type of Fat-Making Stem Cell Emerges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using single-cell &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/hackers-turning-dna-sequencing-biosecurity-000700607.html" data-ylk="slk:RNA sequencing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;RNA sequencing&lt;/a&gt;, the team closely studied the behavior of these APCs. They discovered that while APCs stayed mostly dormant in young mice, they became highly active during middle age. They produced many new fat cells, particularly around the midsection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more surprising, the researchers found that aging transformed APCs into a new type of stem cell they named committed preadipocytes, age-specific (CP-As). These CP-As multiplied rapidly and had a strong ability to generate new fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adolfo Garcia-Ocana, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Molecular &amp;amp; Cellular Endocrinology at City of Hope, pointed out the significance of this discovery: “While most &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/scientists-create-synthetic-cells-shape-180700817.html" data-ylk="slk:adult stem cells;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;adult stem cells&lt;/a&gt;’ capacity to grow wanes with age, the opposite holds true with APCs—aging unlocks these cells’ power to evolve and spread. This is the first evidence that our bellies expand with age due to the APCs’ high output of new fat cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team's research showed that CP-As arise specifically during middle age and continue fueling fat buildup through early aging, providing new insights into why visceral fat is so difficult to control after your forties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Graphical abstract. Adipogenesis contributes to age-related visceral adipose tissue accumulation. (CREDIT: Science)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A Crucial Signaling Pathway Fuels Belly Fat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists then identified a key signaling pathway that made this fat-boosting process possible. A protein receptor called the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) was found to be critical in promoting the CP-A cells’ ability to multiply and form new fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We discovered that the body’s fat-making process is driven by LIFR. While young mice don't require this signal to make fat, older mice do,” Wang explained. Without LIFR, CP-As could not generate fat as aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding opens exciting possibilities for medical interventions. Targeting the LIFR pathway could eventually help prevent or slow down &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/does-body-fat-affect-your-risk-of-alzheimers-or-parkinsons/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:belly fat accumulation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;belly fat accumulation&lt;/a&gt; in middle-aged and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm their results applied to humans, the researchers studied APCs from people of different ages. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed similar CP-A cells appearing in middle-aged individuals, just like in mice. These human CP-As also showed strong fat-producing abilities, suggesting that similar biological mechanisms drive age-related weight gain across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Adipogenesis increases in middle-aged mice and correlates with visceral adiposity. (CREDIT: Science)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why Middle-Age Belly Fat Matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belly fat is more than a cosmetic issue. It increases the risk for a host of serious conditions, including insulin resistance, heart disease, and other metabolic disorders. Even if your body mass index stays the same, a rise in visceral fat during middle age can shorten your healthy lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown that WAT plays a vital role in regulating hormones and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-class-of-drugs-target-brain-metabolism-to-treat-alzheimers-patients/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metabolism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. It has great plasticity, meaning it can change composition and behavior based on your body’s needs. As energy expenditure slows with age and tissues change, WAT undergoes remodeling, adding to health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, it remained unclear how much of middle-age fat gain was due to simply enlarging existing fat cells versus creating new ones. Earlier work suggested that new fat cell formation, known as adipogenesis, slowed with age. But Wang’s study overturned this belief, showing that, at least in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/green-mediterranean-diets-can-significantly-reduce-body-fat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:visceral fat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt;, adipogenesis actually ramps up during middle age because of CP-As.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also explained why older adults can experience sarcopenic obesity—gaining fat while losing muscle—even if their overall weight does not change much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;High adipogenic rate of APCs in middle-aged mice. (CREDIT: Science)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;New Paths Toward Healthier Aging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will now focus on tracking CP-A cells more closely in living animals and in &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/smallest-ever-rechargeable-lithium-battery-180700165.html" data-ylk="slk:human tissues;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;human tissues&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists also aim to explore treatments that could eliminate or suppress these cells. Blocking CP-A formation or the LIFR signaling pathway might one day help middle-aged people maintain leaner bodies and enjoy longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings highlight the importance of controlling new fat-cell formation to address age-related obesity," said Wang. "Understanding the role of CP-As in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/global-study-links-height-to-heart-metabolic-and-mental-health-risks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metabolic disorders;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metabolic disorders&lt;/a&gt; and how these cells emerge during aging could lead to new medical solutions for reducing belly fat and improving health and longevity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first authors of the study, Guan Wang, Ph.D. from City of Hope and Gaoyan Li, Ph.D. from UCLA, played major roles in driving this research forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With continued study, the mysteries behind belly fat and aging are becoming clearer. And with that understanding comes new hope for healthier, more vibrant years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: The article above provided above by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Brighter Side of News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Brighter Side of News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like these kind of feel good stories?

                Community health worker Geoffrey Chanda used to distribute HIV medications to long-haul truck drivers and sex workers at truck stops like this one near the border of Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;On a morning in early April, Geoffrey Chanda's phone was going off almost constantly. Truck drivers were calling him.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They are crying: 'We've got no [HIV] medicine. Where do you get [it] from?' " says Chanda, 54.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For 15 years, Chanda has been meeting truckers in dusty parking lots at the border of Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo to give them their HIV medications. Now, he says, he doesn't know what to tell them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He's lost his job as a community health worker. The U.S.-funded program he worked for — which supported the mobile clinic where he collected the medications for distribution — shut down.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;On inauguration night — 100 days ago this week — the U.S. froze the vast majority of foreign aid, including billions of dollars in programs addressing global health issues. Since then most of the freezes have turned to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/04/11/g-s1-58942/usaid-humanitarian-aid-canceled" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;terminations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first glance, it would seem as if Chanda's job should have been spared.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We are continuing essential lifesaving programs," Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/on-delivering-an-america-first-foreign-assistance-program/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; issued&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;on March 28. "We are reorienting our foreign assistance programs to align directly with what is best for the United States and our citizens."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The continuation of lifesaving programs, the Trump Administration says, include the distribution of HIV medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, on the ground in Zambia, a different reality is apparent. Many HIV-clinics have shut their doors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A State Department spokesperson said in a statement to NPR this month that U.S. partners who are providing lifesaving HIV treatment have been "notified and urged to resume approved service delivery." The spokesperson did not respond to requests for information about specific actions the U.S. has taken to resume HIV services in Zambia and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As of this week, Chanda says he's heard nothing about restarting his work delivering HIV medications, although a limited number of other U.S.-funded HIV clinics in Zambia have restarted with significantly reduced capacity.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Still, Chanda spends his days picking up a string of calls from truck drivers and sex workers who haven't been able to collect their HIV medications since the end of January — and are now getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking the truckers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Chanda started this work 15 years ago as a volunteer but, after his own brother died of AIDS in 2018, he decided to do it full time. " 'Let me teach others not to get [HIV],' " he remembers thinking to himself.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Leaving his job as a miner underground, Chanda moved above ground, spending his days in those dusty parking lots where 18-wheelers line up, many loaded down with freshly-mined minerals. While the drivers were waiting for clearance from government authorities to cross the border, Chanda would make sure those who needed HIV drugs had them before hitting the road again.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He was responsible for coordinating with over 200 truck drivers — as well as more than 150 sex workers. Calling and texting them, he'd figure out when they'd be passing through the border crossing and go meet them armed with their pills and all the information they needed about how not to spread HIV. He'd also helped identify people who were HIV-negative but at high-risk of getting HIV, to help them get information as well as medication that prevents people from getting the virus in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59797" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Long-haul truckers sometimes pause for days at this truck stop near the Zambian town of Chililabombwe as they await approval to cross the border into the Democratic Republic of Congo. Distributing HIV medicine on trucking routes is critical to stopping the spread of HIV, say public health experts.

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reaching those at high risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Chanda was part of a broader effort in Zambia and elsewhere to zero in on this population of long-haul truck drivers and sex workers because they're seen as critical in halting the spread of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the early days of the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, the virus fanned out along trucking routes as long-haul drivers frequented sex workers. At the peak of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1990s and early 2000s, these communities were very hard hit — for example, &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03768350500253153#d1e1004" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 2001 found that in South Africa 56% of truck drivers surveyed were HIV-positive. Still today, worldwide, long-haul truck drivers are nearly six times as likely as the general adult population to be HIV-positive, according to &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/14/8/e085058.share" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published last year in &lt;em&gt;BMJ Open.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Zambia sits at a key crossroads on the HIV/AIDS map. The landlocked country in southern Africa is bordered by eight other countries and major transport corridors crisscross the nation. Zambia is heavily dependent on its long-haul truck drivers, in part to export all the copper mined in the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So public health experts in Zambia have designed special initiatives to reach this high-risk population. People like Chanda were a key part of the strategy, often working long days under the hot sun to make sure that highly mobile truck drivers — and the highly stigmatized sex workers that they patronize — have access to consistent HIV care and prevention services.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, Chanda says he's alarmed to learn that many of his former clients are getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On that day in early April, Chanda estimated that about 20 of the 200 truck drivers he worked with have called and told him they're falling ill without their HIV medications. In the arcades and bars that line the main street of Chililabombwe, near the border between Zambia and Congo, Chanda has heard that one of his drivers passed away in Congo because he didn't have his HIV medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He died in Congo. [And] bringing the body [back to Zambia], it's very expensive," says long-haul truck driver Roi Silunyange, 54, who knew the deceased man.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60043" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Zambian trucker Roi Silunyange, 54, stands in a parking lot at a truck stop near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. He says that he knows a fellow truck driver who died while in Congo because he ran out of HIV medication.

   &lt;p&gt;Mwape Shamboko, another driver, standing nearby in the lot that April morning, used to rely on health workers like Chanda and the U.S.-funded system to get his HIV medications. He says there was even an emergency number any driver or sex worker could call if something were amiss. Community health workers like Chanda would pick up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you're not feeling well, or you need a supply — maybe your medicines have run out — [we] would call that number, and [the community health workers] were always very quick at coming to us and responding to our needs," Mwape says. "So it was a very, very good system. We were not missing our medications."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59796" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Now, he says, the calls go unanswered. Or if someone does pick up – as Chanda still does – they are unable to help.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No more preventive HIV care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Like the truck drivers, sex workers are also feeling a sense of abandonment. They too report major disruptions in getting their HIV medications – as well as the end of most HIV prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They say this is a major problem because their line of work is so risky. Many of the towns that fly past on the roadside have little work available for the residents, pushing young women into prostitution as one of the only ways to make a living.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-63302" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Mercy Lungu is a 27-year-old sex worker from Kitwe, Zambia. She is HIV negative but worries that because the local U.S.-funded clinics have shut down, she won't be able to get access to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/07/03/g-s1-7988/hiv-prevention-drug-clinical-trial" target="_blank"&gt;PrEP&lt;/a&gt; — a medication that prevents a person from contracting HIV.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Mercy Lungu, 27, is one of those women. She's a sex worker in Kitwe, Zambia. And, while she's HIV-negative, she knows the HIV is common in her world: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8386187/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;One study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the African Journal of AIDS Research from 2021 includes estimates that, in Zambia, between 46% and 73% of female sex workers are HIV-positive, compared to roughly 11% of the general population.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says she would "love" to have access to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/07/03/g-s1-7988/hiv-prevention-drug-clinical-trial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PrEP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a medication that prevents a person from contracting HIV. But, she says, the local U.S-funded clinics where her fellow sex workers used to get PrEP have shut down. "When we go there, you find that the staff – they are not there," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even if those clinics were to reopen — as the State Department has said that it's urging — there's another issue. The pills that prevent HIV may not be available. While the Trump Administration says lifesaving aid, like HIV medication, is allowed to continue, preventive HIV care has not been included in their definition of "lifesaving" — with the exception of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-63304" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Juliet Banda (left) and Mercy Lungu (right) say that the closure of U.S.-funded HIV clinics has sent fear through the sex worker community. "If I am to contract HIV today, and then I don't have access to medication, then it's scary," Banda says. "Even for my colleagues who are [HIV positive and] in this business, we're really worried."

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;This doesn't make sense to Juliet Banda, a 26-year-old sex worker also in Kitwe. "We do a lot of movement and a lot of interactions — we sleep with multiple partners — so I think when we think about people like us, [we] need the PrEP," she says. "Because that's what will help us to safeguard our lives."&lt;/p&gt;

"Even for my colleagues who are [HIV positive and] in this business, we're really worried."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Geoffrey Chanda says this sense of worry weighs heavily on him too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says each time his phone rings he worries it's another former client who's without HIV pills and now ill.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And on top of that, he says, now he worries for himself too — and his six children. Without his job, he's struggling to pay for food for his family. "[We are] still starving with hunger," he texted this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They're currently seeing a rise in popularity thanks to claims that they can "reverse" the aging process. But how true is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;NAD plus naturally exists in your body and is one of the molecules that helps keep your skin appearing youthful. As you age, your NAD plus levels decrease so it stands to reason that a supplement can help counteract that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, no &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/biological-age-chronological-age-do-anti-aging-hacks-do-anything/" target="_self"&gt;anti-aging method&lt;/a&gt; is foolproof, which is why we consulted doctors and experts to understand what exactly NAD plus is, how supplements can help the body's anti-aging process and whether these supplements are safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5d922cf2-7205-4a2e-bcb3-7ce45af608f0" data-cy="shortcodeListicle" data-id="listicle-5d922cf2-7205-4a2e-bcb3-7ce45af608f0" data-location="LIST" data-position="1" class="c-shortcodeListicle g-border-thin-light-top g-inner-spacing-bottom-medium g-inner-spacing-left-large g-inner-spacing-right-large g-inner-spacing-bottom-xlarge c-shortcodeListicle-notInfoCard g-outer-spacing-bottom-large g-border-thin-light-bottom g-border-thin-light-right g-border-thin-light-left"&gt; &lt;div class="c-shortcodeListicle_text"&gt;     &lt;div class="c-shortcodeListicle_dek c-shortcodeListicleDek c-shortcodeListicleDek-inline g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAD plus supplements may help improve cognitive function, boost energy and metabolism, support heart health and slow the aging process.

It "creates energy and repairs DNA" and also regulates your circadian rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is also involved in the function of sirtuins, proteins that help regulate cell survival and aging processes," said Nayan Patel, a doctor of pharmacy and founder of &lt;a href="https://aurowellness.com/" target="_self"&gt;Auro Wellness&lt;/a&gt;. The coenzyme slightly differs from NADH, which you may also see while looking for NAD plus supplements. NAD plus is oxidized, while NADH is reduced, which basically means NAD plus has an extra electron and when it loses it, it becomes NADH.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAD plus is naturally found in the body, but as you age, your levels drop, which can lead to tiredness and skin aging, Vasyukevich says. An NAD plus supplement can help combat this, as can a vitamin B3 supplement. Although vitamin B3 is not the same as NAD plus, your body converts vitamin B3 into NAD plus, so these extra supplements can also help your NAD plus levels.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;NAD plus benefits &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary benefit of NAD plus, and, in turn, an NAD plus supplement, is that it's an energy booster. Studies -- including &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10692436/" target="_self"&gt;this one from 2023&lt;/a&gt; -- have shown that the coenzyme helps with weight management and balances metabolism, as pointed out by Vasyukevich. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[NAD plus] can do a few cool things," he says. "It can help with skin health by promoting DNA repair and fighting oxidative stress, which is a big reason skin ages. It can also give you more energy by helping your cells make more [adenosine triphosphate or ATP] -- that's the energy your body runs on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Daniel Llao Calvet/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;NAD plus side effects &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalofficesofmanhattan.com/our-team/dr-jonathan-jennings/" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Jonathan Jennings&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internist with Medical Offices of Manhattan and contributor to &lt;a href="https://www.labfinder.com" target="_self"&gt;Lab Finder&lt;/a&gt;, tells CNET that NAD plus supplements are mostly viewed as safe -- but as with any change to your health-care routine, you always want to approach with caution. Especially considering that the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most data suggests all versions are safe in most populations and side effect profiles depend on the mode of supplementation," he says, noting that side effects for the supplement in pill form can differ from those when you take it intravenously, for example. "Common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness and flushing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another common side effect, Vasyukevich says, is an interruption to your sleeping pattern. He says this can happen if you take the supplement too late in the day, which can generally be corrected by changing when you take it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both doctors, as well as Patel, recommend speaking with your health-care provider before starting an NAD plus supplement, as well as if you experience any side effects. If you experience any side effects, you should stop taking the supplement immediately. It may be interacting with another one of your medications or you may even have an allergy to it. You also may have an intolerance to it.

He also advises anyone interested in taking the supplement to discuss it with their doctor, as he wouldn't recommend it for people on certain medications or with specific medical conditions, although he did not specify which because that should be left up to each patient and their health-care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/5/687" target="_self"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; showed, however, that NAD plus supplements could have adverse effects on those with existing liver or kidney problems because of how the supplement is metabolized. "Factors like age, genetic makeup, diet and health conditions can affect the body's response to supplementation," Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;RealPeopleGroup/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do NAD plus supplements actually work to slow down aging? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts and studies believe these supplements can positively affect people if used properly and at a dose recommended by a medical professional. Vasyukevich cautions, though, that they're not a "magic fix" to reverse the aging process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NAD plus supplements can help by boosting the body's repair systems, which may reduce wrinkles and other signs of aging over time," he says. "They won't completely stop aging but they could help your cells stay healthier and function better, which might slow things down a little."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patel tells CNET that these supplements are still actively being studied. While some research shows that they can help improve the appearance of skin or give people more energy, he believes more clinical trials are "necessary" to fully establish efficacy in "aging prevention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also stresses that these supplements should never be used as a replacement for healthy habits, as those are some of the best ways to keep your body youthful as you continue to age. "Exercise, good nutrition, adequate sleep and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/7-stress-relieving-tactics-that-will-help-you-reach-your-carefree-era/" target="_self"&gt;stress management&lt;/a&gt; are crucial for overall well-being," he says, adding that if you're going to try the supplements, take care in choosing them. They're not all equally effective and it's important to pick one that's high-quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;NAD plus supplement dose and can you take it daily? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are different methods of supplementation which include oral, nasal, intramuscular and intravenous versions," Jennings said. Studies have been done on how supplements work in the body, although findings are limited.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patel tells CNET that nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide supplements have been studied and have been shown to improve the aging process but should be approached "with caution." Both types of supplements, also known as NAD plus precursors, are natural compounds that can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5842119/#:~:text=(A)%20Nicotinamide%20mononucleotide%20(NMN,are%20independent%20of%20catalytic%20activity." target="_self"&gt;enhance the production&lt;/a&gt; of NAD plus within the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10692436/#s17" target="_self"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; of nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide oral supplementation reported some improvement in "cardiovascular, metabolic and physical function" in those who participated. This study looked at several groups of people who had been given different doses of a supplement for various periods of time to analyze the efficacy and safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, the dose that is right for you largely depends on what you discuss with your health-care provider. It also depends on the method you choose for supplementation. Most supplements in pill or nasal form can be taken daily but your doctor can advise you on what's best and adjust as needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Tetra Images/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other ways to increase NAD plus levels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking an NAD plus supplement isn't the only way to boost your body's NAD plus levels. In fact, medical professionals recommend that you seek other ways to improve your health in addition to taking supplements because it will enhance the efficacy of the supplements themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't have to rely only on supplements to boost your NAD plus levels. Things like regular exercise, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/what-is-intermittent-fasting-benefits/" target="_self"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt; or even cutting back on calories can naturally increase NAD plus in your body," Vasyukevich says. Do not make any changes to your diet without consulting your doctor first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patel seconded that &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/3-age-defying-exercises-to-do-for-a-better-you/" target="_self"&gt;exercise and a generally healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; are highly recommended throughout your life but especially as you age. "Regular exercise has been shown to boost NAD plus levels by stimulating the production of NAD plus precursors," he says. "Additionally, lifestyle choices like adequate sleep hygiene and stress management can positively affect NAD plus levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you eat can also affect your NAD plus levels, especially if you reach for foods rich in vitamin B3 and niacin, which are precursors for NAD Plus (meaning the body turns them into NAD plus). Foods rich in vitamin B3 and niacin include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beef&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Broccoli&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cabbage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dairy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fruit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peanuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turkey&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we age, the body's naturally occurring coenzyme NAD plus decreases, leading to tiredness and skin aging. However, this can be counteracted with a healthy lifestyle of regular exercise and a diet rich in vitamin B3 and niacin. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/pumping-iron-could-be-the-key-to-aging-gracefully/" target="_self"&gt;Lifting weights&lt;/a&gt; is also a great way to stay healthy as you age. Adding an NAD plus supplement into your daily routine under the supervision of a medical professional can also help boost NAD plus levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on NAD plus supplements is limited, so medical professionals urge people to approach them with caution and under the care of their own doctor.

              &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, isn’t without its risks. A recent study has found that tens of thousands of Americans have ended up in the emergency room from taking semaglutide over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention led the research, &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-03258"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in Annals of Internal Medicine. Based on national surveillance data, the researchers estimate that semaglutide contributed to nearly 25,000 ER visits between 2022 and 2023, usually from gastrointestinal complications. The findings suggest that doctors can do more to mitigate the potentially severe side effects of these drugs, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide and similar drugs mimic GLP-1, one of several hormones that play a key role in regulating our metabolism and hunger. GLP-1 drugs have existed for over two decades, but semaglutide is part of a newer and more effective generation. It was first approved in 2017 to treat type 2 diabetes under the brand name Ozempic. In 2021, it was approved to treat obesity under the brand name Wegovy. Since then, doctors have also commonly prescribed Ozempic off-label for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every drug comes with its side effects, however. People taking GLP-1s commonly experience nausea, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms. Usually, these side effects are mild and/or tend to decline over time. But in some cases, they can become serious enough to warrant emergency medical care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers analyzed data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance Project (&lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/data-sources-and-methods/data-sources/national-electronic-injury-surveillance-system-cooperative-adverse-drug-event-surveillance-project-neiss-cades"&gt;NEISS-CADES&lt;/a&gt;), which keeps track of drug-related adverse events reported to a nationally representative sample of emergency departments in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on 551 documented cases, the researchers estimated that 24,499 ER visits were attributable to semaglutide use between 2022 and 2023. Nearly 70% of these visits involved GI symptoms, while roughly 17% involved hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), and about 6% represented allergic reactions. About a third of hypoglycemia-related visits led to hospitalization, as did 15% of GI-related visits.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings should be taken in some context. Many drugs can cause side effects that could result in an ER visit, including common over-the-counter medications. In a 2021 study from many of the same authors, they found that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8493432/#:~:text=Based%20on%2096%E2%80%89925%20cases%20(mean%20patient%20age%2C%2049%20years%3B%2055%25%20female)%2C%20there%20were%20an%20estimated%206.1%20(95%25%20CI%2C%204.8%2D7.5)%20ED%20visits%20for%20medication%20harms%20per%201000%20population%20annually%20and%2038.6%25%20(95%25%20CI%2C%2035.2%25%2D41.9%25)%20resulted%20in%20hospitalization."&gt;roughly 1 in 200 Americans&lt;/a&gt; visit the ER each year due to medication-related harms, for instance, with two-thirds caused by therapeutic use (meaning that the drugs were taken to treat a medical problem, not recreationally). A 2022 study by the same team &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34757641/"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that OTC cough or cold medications cause about 27,000 ER visits in the U.S. annually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the results of this latest study shouldn’t be minimized either. More than 82% of the ER visits happened in 2023, suggesting that as semaglutide use has surged, so have its potential harms. About 9% of the visits involved medication errors, such as people taking more than instructed. So we might be able to prevent some ER visits with better patient education. In other cases, doctors could lower their patients’ risk of serious complications by better managing their use of other medications, and at the very least, they can probably do more to prepare their patients in advance before starting GLP-1 therapy, the researchers argue.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Clinicians could counsel patients when initiating semaglutide about the potential for severe gastrointestinal adverse effects and adjust co-prescribed antidiabetic medications to decrease hypoglycemia risk,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cacio e pepe is made by cooking pasta and using the resulting starchy water to create a sauce with grated cheese and pepper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now researchers recommend that the perfect recipe for two involves dissolving 5g of powdered starch in 50g of water rather than using the reserved pasta water&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– as traditional recipes do. Then, heat the mixture gently until it thickens and turns clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Next, add 100g of water to cool the mixture, before blending it with 200g of cheese and adding toasted black pepper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The resulting sauce should then be mixed with 300g of pasta that has been cooked in slightly salted water until it is al dente, drained and allowed to cool slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This step helps prevent the excessive heat from destabilising the sauce. Finally, they say a little reserved starchy water can be used to adjust the consistency as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A true Italian grandmother or a skilled home chef from Rome would never need a scientific recipe for cacio e pepe, relying instead on instinct and years of experience,” the researchers write. “For everyone else, this guide offers a practical way to master the dish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Ivan Di Terlizzi, one of the co-authors of the research, said the team consumed about 6kg of cheese for the study, with “most of it eaten with bread”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Although we are still not tired of this delicious dish, one of the authors had blood tests showing very high cholesterol levels,” he added. “It’s the price of science!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“When heated, cheese proteins change their configuration and, therefore, aggregate,” said Dr Daniel Busiello, another co-author of the study from Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;. Starch, he said, mitigates this effect by binding to the cheese proteins, reducing their direct interactions and hence their formation of clumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To explore the secret to a smooth and creamy sauce, researchers carried out a number of experiments using a fixed cheese-to-water ratio, but with varying concentrations of starch. The latter was controlled by dissolving known quantities of dry corn starch in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The results revealed fewer clumps occurred at lower temperatures, regardless of starch concentration, with the team adding that the proteins did not start to clump below 65C. As temperatures increased, higher concentrations of starch were needed to avoid clumps forming and prevent the “mozzarella phase” – where huge wads of cheese appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“At higher starch concentrations, temperature becomes less of a concern, as the sauce remains smooth even with less precise heat control,” said Busiello.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Busiello added pasta water alone contains too little starch to reliably prevent clumping, only producing a smooth sauce with careful temperature control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Our recommended scientific approach uses a starch to cheese ratio between 2% and 3% by weight, allowing home cooks to reliably create a smooth sauce without worrying too much about temperature,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNMTFOQWl6Q2x0TzE2cUkzejJaM2NKZ19JejZvMmFOWWpScG5haXRrc1JXUHJRSW45cmVXTWNvUkxneW4waFpLUkpkeGNLWG0zQ1J2MHJQZW1yVFh0dGtBUjF6Rk04VVhXUFJ6WVc2ZEJSZVJjTm1KYVhVUUhWVVlSY2hNWXZCeFJMNDZEZVliN0VWX3gtV3J4dGdLVjhFbk5XZEZsdnJDNVhzd1BMQTFkQWpGNmlrN2UzeXc</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，如果您患有糖尿病，保持水分的首选方法- EatingWell | The #1 Way to Stay Hydrated If You Have Diabetes, According to a Dietitian - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE9KVzdXTXcwMEduUThRbC1lcjVQNTROUUc0cXRLYmdFQ0JnRUhPRWtlekxJaW1FZ25NRVpObFZSY0xYSUVMMjl4Zm14V2ZnQkFncTBTcU5SVWlhSzR3TXhxQkVraVRoXzRseU1SaUFWWFk4T2NkTlkw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hydration plays a key role in healthy blood sugar and it keeps you energized.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yet, it can be difficult to remember to drink enough water to stay hydrated. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carrying a water bottle is an easy way to help you get the fluids you need.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Limiting carbohydrates, staying active and prioritizing protein and fiber often steal the spotlight when it comes to managing diabetes. However, there’s one simple but powerful strategy that often gets overlooked: hydration. Drinking water sounds easy enough, but falling short could have a big impact on your blood sugar and metabolic health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why is hydration so important for people with diabetes? Water makes up 60% to 75% of our bodies and plays an instrumental role in every single one of its functions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “If the body becomes dehydrated, blood sugar becomes more concentrated, leading to higher blood sugar levels and an increased strain on the body organs, like the kidneys, as they work to eliminate the excess glucose in urine,” says &lt;a href="http://erinpalinski.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, CDE&lt;/a&gt;, a New Jersey-based registered dietitian and certified diabetes educator and author of &lt;em&gt;2 Day Diabetes Diet.&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While staying hydrated supports healthy blood sugar levels, research shows it also improves overall metabolic health, potentially reducing the risk of weight gain, obesity and heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Hydration is also associated with improved cognition, energy levels and mood, which may make it easier to eat better and exercise.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If drinking more water feels like a constant struggle, there’s one habit that’s sure to help you stay hydrated: keeping a water bottle on hand. We spoke with a diabetes expert to find out why it’s so effective. Here’s what she told us. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-carrying-a-water-bottle-can-help-you-stay-hydrated"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Carrying a Water Bottle Can Help You Stay Hydrated  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carrying a water bottle with you, whether you’re at home, running errands or working, keeps hydration top of mind and helps you stay ahead of thirst. “If you wait until you feel thirsty, you are already slightly dehydrated, which can lead to elevated blood sugar levels along with fatigue,” says Palinski-Wade. “Having a water bottle with you gives you a visual reminder to drink, which helps to make sure you are consistently taking in water all day long.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It also provides an easy way to gauge how much you’ve had to drink and how much more you need to hit your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8061842/how-much-water-do-you-need-when-you-have-diabetes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;daily water goals&lt;/a&gt;. Just like carrying a snack helps prevent dips in blood sugar and energy levels, having a water bottle on hand will help you avoid the effects of dehydration, including headaches, fatigue and high blood sugar. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, when you’ve got water nearby, you’re less likely to stop for a soda or sugar-sweetened drink. Not only do sugary drinks spike blood sugar, they may ironically contribute to dehydration. “If you consume an excessive amount of added sugar, this can draw water from your cells into the bloodstream, increasing urination and impairing fluid balance,” says Palinski-Wade. Even specialty hydration drinks can have added sugars. That doesn’t mean all hydration drinks are bad. Some are sugar-free. To find out for sure, check the Nutrition Facts panel on the label.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, you may be wondering how much fluid you need each day to stay hydrated. While the answer is different for everybody, a good goal is roughly 13 cups for men and 9 cups for women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, your unique needs may differ depending on the temperature, if you exercise and your body weight, medications and health conditions. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-for-hydration"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies for Hydration &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Make carrying a water bottle a habit you’ll stick with by choosing a bottle that sparks joy, is lightweight, comfortable to hold and won’t leak when tossed in a bag or the car. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These other strategies can also help improve your hydration game.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track Your Water:&lt;/strong&gt; Whether you’re just starting your hydration journey or trying to stay consistent, logging your water intake can help you stay on track. “You can use apps such as MyFitnessPal to track your fluid intake or use your phone to set reminders to drink throughout the day,” says Palinski-Wade. Monitoring your water intake can also help you identify patterns when you’re more likely to forget to drink water. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Low-Sugar Flavor&lt;/strong&gt;: If plain water feels boring, try sprucing it up with fresh fruit and herbs, like this no-sugar-added &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/265887/lemon-cucumber-mint-infused-water/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lemon, Cucumber &amp;amp; Mint Infused Water&lt;/a&gt;. You can also alternate regular water with plain or flavored sparkling water. Or, try adding a sugar-free flavor packet to your H2O.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Hydrating Foods&lt;/strong&gt;: Drinks aren’t the only way to hit your daily fluid goals. Foods provide 20% of our daily fluids, especially &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17576/8-hydrating-foods-to-help-you-meet-your-water-goals/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;hydrating foods&lt;/a&gt; like fruits and veggies. “Try adding foods such as cucumber, watermelon, lettuce and celery to your plate to boost your water intake,” says Palinski-Wade. Not only do these foods give you fluids, they’re packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and fiber to support balanced blood sugar and overall health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Your Urine Color&lt;/strong&gt;: It may sound strange, but a quick and easy way to measure your hydration status is by simply checking the color of your pee. Light-colored urine is a sign of adequate hydration. The darker the urine becomes, the more likely it is that you need to drink up.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight mntl-block theme-1-2-post"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Hydrating Dinner Recipes to Try&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hydration may not get as much attention as carbohydrates or exercise when it comes to managing diabetes. But it plays a key role in healthy blood sugar levels and can help you feel healthier and more energetic overall. That’s why staying ahead of your thirst by keeping a water bottle on hand is the No. 1 habit to support healthy hydration while managing diabetes. For the best results, pair this habit with other expert-approved strategies like tracking your water intake, drinking no-added-sugar beverages, eating hydrating foods and monitoring your urine color. So, what are you waiting for? It’s time to drink up!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EatingWell</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9KVzdXTXcwMEduUThRbC1lcjVQNTROUUc0cXRLYmdFQ0JnRUhPRWtlekxJaW1FZ25NRVpObFZSY0xYSUVMMjl4Zm14V2ZnQkFncTBTcU5SVWlhSzR3TXhxQkVraVRoXzRseU1SaUFWWFk4T2NkTlkw</guid></item><item><title>氯胺酮隐藏的身心伤害-神经科学新闻 | Ketamine's Hidden Physical and Psychological Damage - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE1NTWhFMG5ZcUlOeDV5X18wbGlPZFk4ZGsyQy1TQ3QtTzZjZXEzN3FzYVNyMUpnQmUwLTFzbFNBUDhJb2VQSFRGY3p4SUpOMEotc0dvbHR3LW5CQnJIam5uTUZhX3lXcF9vT1NWc0dpZmhzeDdvSUJN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study highlights the severe physical and psychological consequences linked to ketamine addiction, with many users unaware of the risks until dependent. Researchers found high rates of bladder damage, painful organ cramps, low mood, and anxiety among those with ketamine use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the serious health impacts, nearly half of affected individuals had not sought treatment, and many reported poor experiences with healthcare providers. The findings call for better public awareness, improved clinical recognition, and more effective treatment programs for ketamine addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severe Health Impacts:&lt;/strong&gt; 60% of ketamine users reported bladder or nasal problems, and over half experienced painful organ cramps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Treatment Access:&lt;/strong&gt; Only 56% sought help, and only 36% of those were satisfied with their care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awareness Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Many users were unaware ketamine could cause addiction until it was too late, highlighting urgent public education needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ketamine addiction is linked to high levels of physical health problems and psychological consequences, with nearly half of those affected not seeking support or treatment, new research has revealed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by the University of Exeter and University College London (UCL), is the largest to date to explore the experience of people currently living with ketamine addiction in-depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supported by NIHR, the research included interviews with users, in which many said they were not aware of the risks of addiction until their ketamine use was already out of control, with one calling ketamine “the heroin of a generation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers studied 274 people who identified as having ketamine use disorder, and found previously under-reported symptoms. Of those, 60 per cent had experienced bladder or nasal problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that 56 per cent reported K-cramps – a painful organ cramping linked to excessive ketamine use, with which can often drive people back to the drug to seek relief from the pain of this symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bladder problems can involve needing a full bladder removal, and the need for a urostomy bag to collect urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychological symptoms included cravings, low mood, anxiety and irritability.  The research, published in &lt;em&gt;Addiction&lt;/em&gt;, found that only 56 per cent of participants sought treatment, and only 36 per cent of those were satisfied with their care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Professor Celia Morgan, of University of Exeter, said: “We know that ketamine use is on the rise, with a number of high-profile tragedies linked to ketamine addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Meanwhile, a growing number of clinical trials are finding therapeutic benefits involving ketamine in carefully-controlled environments, combined with therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research is the first to analyse in-depth the experience of people using very large amounts of ketamine, and shows the devastating physical health problems people can face with dependent ketamine use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study also highlights the barriers that people with ketamine addiction face when they try to seek treatment, often being sent away from treatment services.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uk government data indicates that ketamine use has more than doubled since 2016, with a threefold increase among 25-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the impact on those who develop an addition to ketamine, the study involved both questionnaires and interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, 59 per cent of participants reported that there was “definitely not” enough awareness in education and among peer groups around the risks associated with ketamine, with many reporting that they did not know the drug could be addictive. Many reported feeling too embarrassed to seek treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In interviews, one participant said: “People know the risks about Heroin and Cocaine, but not how the addiction to Ketamine can become even stronger than being addicted to heroin or cocaine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While another told researchers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel it is the heroin of a generation, and more information will become available once more time passes and more people my age begin to suffer so greatly from misuse that it can’t be hidden anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also painted a picture of a lack of understanding among health professionals. One said: All they did was give me painkillers and send me on my way”, while another reported “GP doesn’t think ketamine is addictive, just told me to stop, doesn’t have a clue”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-author Rebecca Harding, a PhD candidate at University College London, said: “Our study highlights the need for greater recognition of the significant physical and psychological risks associated with ketamine, both among healthcare professionals and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need improved treatment programs, while raising awareness of ketamine use, to better support those seeking care. By focusing on evidence-based treatments, such as specialised group therapy and pharmacological interventions, we can improve access to effective treatment and address the growing challenge of ketamine use disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this addiction and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d7a7a5b2a4a4b8b1b1beb4b297b2afb2a3b2a5f9b6b4f9a2bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Louise Vennells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://exeter.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Louise Vennells – University of Exeter&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/add.70073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The landscape of ketamine use disorder: patient experiences and perspectives on current treatment options&lt;/a&gt;” by Celia Morgan et al. &lt;em&gt;Addiction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The landscape of ketamine use disorder: patient experiences and perspectives on current treatment options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0001-title"&gt;Aims&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To report the symptoms and aetiology of ketamine use disorder (KUD), gauge the effectiveness of current treatment services and identify strategies to enhance patient access and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0002-title"&gt;Design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mixed-methods, cross-sectional questionnaire. Electronic survey from November 2023 to April 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0003-title"&gt;Setting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were recruited through snowball sampling, social media and referrals from UK addiction treatment services. The survey was open to international participants, with responses collected from the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Europe and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0004-title"&gt;Participants/Cases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 274 individuals with self-identified KUD, including both treatment-seeking (40%) and non-treatment-seeking (60%) current or former ketamine users. Participants’ ages ranged from 18 to 67 years old, with 47.7% identifying as male. Additionally, 58.8% reported a diagnosed mental health disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, participants consumed 2.0 g of ketamine per day, with treatment-seeking individuals reporting higher average use (M = 2.67 g) than non-treatment-seeking users (M = 1.68 g) (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0005-title"&gt;Measurements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed an online questionnaire addressing their attitudes toward ketamine and treatment services, including questions pertaining to their symptoms of problematic ketamine use, perceptions of education and awareness about KUD, opinions of existing treatment options, and facilitators for seeking treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0006-title"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified various physical symptoms associated with KUD, with bladder problems (60%), nasal problems (60%) and ‘K-cramps’ (56%) being commonly reported among all users. In response to these symptoms, the majority (56%) did not seek treatment; among treatment-seeking users only 36% reported feeling satisfied with their care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of abstinence syndrome were also identified, including cravings (71%), low mood (62%), anxiety (59%) and irritability (45%). Treatment-seeking participants reported that the services they used had little (31%) or some (31%) awareness of ketamine, were not tailored to ketamine use (43%) and were generally only somewhat effective (43%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-nine percent of participants reported that there was “definitely not” sufficient awareness in education and peer groups about the risks associated with ketamine use. When asked about the most important factors when choosing a treatment program, cost/affordability was the most cited for all participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="add70073-sec-0007-title"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketamine use disorder (KUD) appears to be associated with a high prevalence of physical and psychological symptoms, including some specifically linked to abstinence. Despite this, most individuals with KUD do not seek treatment, and existing services are often perceived as ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 15:56:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE1NTWhFMG5ZcUlOeDV5X18wbGlPZFk4ZGsyQy1TQ3QtTzZjZXEzN3FzYVNyMUpnQmUwLTFzbFNBUDhJb2VQSFRGY3p4SUpOMEotc0dvbHR3LW5CQnJIam5uTUZhX3lXcF9vT1NWc0dpZmhzeDdvSUJN</guid></item><item><title>呃，在选择退出CT扫描之前，你应该三思而后行，因为你担心癌症。-石板 | Uh, You Should Think Twice Before Opting Out of a CT Scan Because You’re Worried About Cancer. - Slate</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxPN3lFRmZ0YWlrR25YazFtWFdMbW9lbWFoYnlIdVUydkJJWWx5d19PekllMldfRWstNm9yOGNiRzFLdG0xb1hoVUpuMEswNDVscmpTUjNGYU9Qbi0xbnR4NWhHNUgtY2tLWnlwS2JrMVR0WGdqeU5TWVlKNVNhZHRnelFWVEphUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrave0083cwm4bsu4i0ln@published"&gt;When you get an X-ray, it can be a bit unnerving: The radiology technician puts on a lead gown or ducks behind a barrier before running the scan. Which might make you wonder: If the radiation is so bad that they need protective equipment, why are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; getting exposed to it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rreow000o3b73eibfswbb@published"&gt;There is a simple answer. You are getting only one dose of radiation from your scan, but the tech might be doing a couple dozen of those same scans a day. Radiation doses add up, so people who regularly work with the machines need protection so that they can lower their risk of getting cancer from their job.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rreqk000p3b73fxb5cyhr@published"&gt;But a new study questions whether scans—specifically &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675#:~:text=Your%20healthcare%20professional%20may%20suggest,infection%20or%20blood%20clot%20is."&gt;computed tomography scans&lt;/a&gt;—are causing more cancer than we thought, specifically among the patients who receive them. CTs are given to people in emergency departments who have had &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.carj.2018.10.004?casa_token=fSwu9Jxec7wAAAAA%3ArsB5yV9MVaaoE09squWTsWYH5xJnqeUNgkk8c8UsfYajm9PTCKYdfRsX_Q1vLmlCHucww3bmYhxd7A"&gt;serious trauma or are having a suspected stroke&lt;/a&gt;. Other CTs are used to identify and treat cancer, rule out serious neurological problems, and more. &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14610965/cancer-CT-scans-study-children.html"&gt;According&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ct-scans-projected-to-result-in-100000-new-cancers-in-the-us"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/ct-scan-cancer-risk-11719982"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/16/g-s1-60488/ct-scan-cancer-risk-ionizing-radiation"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/could-ct-scans-be-fuelling-a-future-rise-in-cancer-cases-as-a-new-study-suggests-254633"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt;, CT scans could be &lt;em&gt;causing&lt;/em&gt; a remarkably high number of cancers each year and could eventually be responsible for 1 in 20 cancers in the United States. Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rreu7000q3b7317m4bvst@published"&gt;There are, however, some major issues with the media reports. Although CT scans can and sometimes do cause cancer in patients, the reality is that you probably aren’t in much danger when you go in for a recommended scan.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrew1000r3b73riza114s@published"&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778"&gt;The study itself&lt;/a&gt; is basically a modeling exercise. The authors took an estimate of the number of CT scans done every year in the U.S., based on research from 2023. Next, they estimated the dose of radiation that each CT would give the patient, based on the body part that was exposed in the scan and evidence from studies of radiation dosage. Finally, they used an online calculator, called RadRAT, to estimate the number of cancers that the estimated radiation dosage would cause over the lifetimes of all the people getting the scans.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrey1000s3b739qi89lj3@published"&gt;The authors found that in 2023 there were 93 million CTs done on 62 million patients. The total estimated lifetime number of cancers caused by the radiation from these CTs in their model came out to about 100,000. So, for the 62 million people who got CTs over the course of 2023, there would eventually be an additional 100,000 cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrezv000t3b73yrh12cwt@published"&gt;This sounds like a big number, but is it, really, compared with the overall amount of cancer in the population? If you ask the authors, they say that the cancer from CT scans could &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; add up to 5 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States. That seems pretty significant! But this is assuming that the number of yearly cancers stays the same between now and 2075 (about the time the kids included in the study would be developing cancer from the CT scans they received in 2023). That’s very unlikely—the total number of cancers annually will probably &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; by then due to population growth alone. In any case, it’s a figure based on an iffy assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrf1f000u3b731cw7jnyb@published"&gt;I think a better way to look at this is by considering that about 40 percent of people will get cancer in their lifetime. If 62 million people are getting CTs, we’d estimate that 25 million of them would get cancer without the additional CT risk. The extra cancers from the CTs therefore account for an additional 0.4 percent, or one extra lifetime cancer per 250 people.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="150" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrf33000v3b733zlg898e@published"&gt;In context, that number is not scary at all. The authors of the study compare CT scans with alcohol consumption, which is another risk factor for cancer. But people rarely get CT scans for the fun of it. One of the most common reasons for having a CT in the first place is because you either probably or definitely have cancer already, and the imaging can help doctors know exactly what they’re dealing with so they can do their best to get rid of it. Most people are likely fine with accepting a 1-in-250 risk of getting an additional cancer if it means that their current cancer can be treated appropriately rather than having a surgeon simply guess where the tumor is located. No serious medical treatment is risk-free; we get treatment anyway because the downsides of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; doing anything are worse. In this case, they can be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; worse.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrf4q000w3b733essq6i1@published"&gt;The other issue with the estimate of 100,000 cancers is that it’s almost certainly too high. RadRAT, the calculator that the researchers used, is designed to estimate the lifetime risk of cancer for people who &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/22810503"&gt;are generally healthy&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, when calculating lifetime risk, the tool assumes that people who are exposed to radiation are going to live as long as the average person of that age and sex who was alive in the U.S. in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrf6f000x3b735ojrikzw@published"&gt;But we know that CTs are not generally given to otherwise healthy people. If you’re not in great shape to start, you’re less likely to live as long as the average person, and you have less time to develop cancer in the first place. It’s quite likely that the lifetime number of cancers is dramatically overestimated by the published paper.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrf82000y3b73d1dcufzp@published"&gt;There is a useful bit of truth in the lesson news stories are taking from the paper: You shouldn’t get a CT scan unless you actually need one. We do have a problem with doing too many CT scans. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0363018820302048?casa_token=AfuUGbksmKsAAAAA:qZp3p8PkAo5Rz85VSYJvNHIh-8kdiNKfvHcgGoc_o2Bchl_6rqGYterhy72ahf8_4auWs82bNg"&gt;Studies looking at&lt;/a&gt; whether CT scans were appropriately ordered suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009926019305483?casa_token=jxHFl11ruDYAAAAA:2uPHWrYbFRKabpaT8M5gveiQunC62Oye7WbS0aR-l6qUvWfc-6F-LxbvG8-dC8PiSAg_5lPGkQ"&gt;somewhere between&lt;/a&gt; 8 and 36 percent of them are not needed. Given that these scans definitely do cause cancer—albeit quite rarely—we should instead be trying to ensure that we perform them only when absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cma1rrfa1000z3b73gs21j47l@published"&gt;That being said, the idea that 1 in 20 cancers is—or will be—&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJABhXDyX5t/?hl=en"&gt;caused by CTs&lt;/a&gt; is very unlikely to be true. The actual figure is presumably quite a bit lower. And while we should be careful to use those high-radiation scans only when necessary, in most cases if a doctor tells you to get a CT, you should probably do &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stem cell-derived pancreatic islets are being studied as a rich transplantable source for insulin production, a therapeutic for type 1 diabetes that overcomes the need to obtain islet cells from deceased donors.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The first attempts to transplant &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/islet+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;islet cells&lt;/a&gt; to treat type 1 diabetes began half a century ago. Doctors then sought the pancreatic tissue of deceased donors from which islet-producing tissue was removed for transplants. The islets produce life-saving insulin. Substantial advancements and increased success rates have led to islet-cell transplants becoming an approved therapy in Canada and Europe. The technique is still considered investigational in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a series of new advances, a team of endocrinologists and regenerative medicine specialists in the Netherlands has developed methods that improve the production of stem cells used to generate insulin-making islets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers have also developed methods to protect the "architecture" of islet cells emerging from their production techniques. Altogether, the new developments suggest a robust supply of stem cell-generated islets that can be made available on demand. The technique homes in on the coveted beta cell, the type of islet that generates insulin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The progressive loss of insulin-producing β cells is a hallmark of type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition resulting from a combination of genetic and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/environmental+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;environmental factors&lt;/a&gt;," writes Dr. Bahareh Rajaei, lead author of a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adl4390" target="_blank"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"An insufficient functional β cell mass leads to an elevation of the blood sugar concentration—hyperglycemia—which can lead to ketoacidosis and death if left untreated," added Rajaei, an expert in regenerative medicine at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type 1 diabetes is a major global health concern, a lifelong problem that affects millions of people around the globe. The World Health Organization estimated in 2022, the most recent year for complete statistics, that 8.75 million people were living with type 1 diabetes. Children and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/young+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;young adults&lt;/a&gt; are significant populations with the condition, which is characterized by the body's inability to produce insulin. People with type 1 diabetes must take insulin daily to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pancreas, islet cells thrive in clusters and are the cellular constituents that exist in alpha and beta forms. They make up the islets of Langerhans, defined groups of cells within the endocrine tissue of the pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha islets produce glucagon, the pancreatic hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. Glucagon stimulates the liver to release glycogen—stored sugar—into the bloodstream, an activity that raises blood glucose. Beta islets, by contrast, produce the glucose-lowering hormone insulin. When &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/beta+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;beta cells&lt;/a&gt; are missing or irreparably impaired, glucose control goes awry, and type 1 diabetes can result.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Endocrinologists and experts in regenerative medicine see stem cell-generated β islets as potentially curative in the not-too-distant future. Currently, islet cells from deceased donors constitute a treatment option that isn't for everyone with type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapy requires medication that suppresses the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, which means doctors generally offer that form of islet cell transplantation to patients for whom the procedure outweighs the risk of immunosuppression. Receiving a transplant doesn't necessarily free patients from daily insulin; many still require daily supplemental doses of the life-saving hormone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, the field has improved dramatically as experts in regenerative medicine refine the science and inexorably move toward stem cells as their source for islet cells. In the United States, where islet-cell transplants are still considered experimental, Vertex Pharmaceuticals of South Boston, Massachusetts, is actively involved in U.S. research and clinical trials. Working collaboratively with physicians, the trials have led to successful transplants involving islets produced from stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What remains to be developed, according to the team in the Netherlands, are protocols and techniques that ensure a ready supply of viable transplantable stem cells that meet high-quality, uniform standards with fewer unwanted cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaei and her team of collaborators have developed a new cell purification technique that can create functional islets from stem cells to treat type 1 diabetes using clinical-grade manufacturing practices.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study reported that β islets generated from stem cells produced in the Leiden laboratories remained functional in animal models. The technology relies on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pluripotent+stem+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pluripotent stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, which are capable of self-renewing and developing into innumerable cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of pluripotent stem cells as blank slates that can morph into any kind of tissue-specific cell type needed in the body. Rajaei and colleagues relied on induced pluripotent stem cells, also known as iPSCs, which are differentiated in the lab into pancreatic islet-like cells prior to transplant. The study focused on the cells' fate in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Human pluripotent stem cell-derived islet transplantation is a promising β cell replacement therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes, offering a potential unlimited cell supply," Rajaei noted in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team pointed out in their paper that problems facing the field had included a lack of uniformity in the final product and purification steps that frequently damaged the architecture of the islets. Their new protocols overcame those obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the field as a whole, Rajaei and her team contend that the production techniques they developed could likely benefit other medical conditions treatable by stem cell infusions. "This method may also contribute to the generation of improved cell-based therapies for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/regenerative+medicine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;regenerative medicine&lt;/a&gt; purposes beyond the stem cell-islet field," Rajaei concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terlizzi and his fellow author are all living abroad and frequently meet for dinner. Cacio e pepe is among their favorite traditional dishes to make, and as physicists, they couldn't help but want to learn more about the unique physics of the process, not to mention "the more practical aim to avoid wasting good pecorino," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1081682?"&gt;said Terlizzi&lt;/a&gt;. They focused on the separation that often occurs when cheese and water are mixed, building on earlier &lt;a href="https://bressanini-lescienze.blogautore.espresso.repubblica.it/2013/05/13/le-ricette-scientifiche-la-cacio-e-pepe/"&gt;culinary experiments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the pasta cooks in boiling water, the noodles release starch. Traditionally, the chef will extract part of the water and starch solution—which is cooled to a suitable temperature to avoid clumping as the cheese proteins "denaturate"—and mix it with the cheese to make the sauce, adding the pepper last, right before serving. But the authors note that temperature is not the only factor that can lead to this dreaded “mozzarella phase."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, if one tries to mix cheese and water without any starch, the clumping is more pronounced. There is less clumping with water containing a little starch, like water in which pasta has been cooked. And when one mixes the cheese with pasta water "risottata"—i.e., collected and heated in a pan so enough water evaporates that there is a higher concentration of starch—there is almost no clumping.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So starch plays a crucial role in the process of making cacio e pepe. The authors devised a set of experiments to scientifically investigate the phase behavior of water, starch, and cheese mixed together in various concentrations and at different temperatures. They primarily used standard kitchen tools to make sure home cooks could recreate their results (although not every kitchen has a sous vide machine). This enabled them to devise a phase diagram of what happens to the sauce as the conditions change.&lt;/p&gt;
