 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Akiko Iwasaki, the lead researcher behind the paper, told MailOnline she understands the pre-print, which was not peer-reviewed but published on website MedRxiv, could be seen as controversial &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One told MailOnline they had developed persistent tinnitus six-hours after their third Covid jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I spent over 12 months on an NHS audiology waiting list, only to be dismissed and told it was merely a coincidence due to my part-time work as a sound engineer,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added how the constant tinnitus, which can take the form of ringing, buzzing or hissing, now dominated his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I struggle with sleep, frequently need to ask people to repeat themselves, and find that the only way I can concentrate at work is by constantly listening to music to drown out the incessant noise,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many who contacted this website he said he had felt 'coerced' into getting the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If I didn't get them, I would have been fired, as there was no place for me in the small office with non-existent social distancing. Being a new starter, I felt I had no choice but to comply,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of the patients who suspect they have PVS told MailOnline directly that were not against vaccines in general, noting that they have saved countless lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2022 study led by academics at Imperial College London suggests almost 20million lives were saved by Covid vaccines in the first year since countries began rolling out the jabs, the majority in wealthy nations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they added that a general failure from experts to acknowledge their experiences of adverse reactions had eroded trust in the health system, an attitude that could put the success of future vaccine programmes at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PVS is still a poorly understood condition, with even the Yale experts who unveiled their findings emphasizing the research is 'still a work in progress'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, the team collected blood samples of 42 Americans with PVS and 22 without it, between December 2022 and November 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with the syndrome were generally in poorer health than the average American, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most complaining of the symptoms developed them after their first or second Covid vaccine, with some experiencing an onset after a third or fourth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with PVS also had elevated levels of Covid spike proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The levels in PVS patients were even greater than those found in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14255465/doctors-relief-long-covid-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;patients with long Covid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a condition with similar symptoms linked to the virus itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It should also be noted that many of the PVS's symptoms are relatively common ailments and can be caused by numerous conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As such, there is currently no way to prove if they are caused by a vaccine or are simply unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Akiko Iwasaki, the lead researcher behind Yale paper, told MailOnline she understands the pre-print, which has not yet peer-reviewed by independent experts, could be seen as controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she added that they will keep studying the condition in an effort to bring affected patients 'better transparency and safer vaccines.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Independent experts, however, have urged for caution over the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing on X, Dr Adam Gaffney, an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Harvard University, also said: 'There's nothing wrong with studying vaccine side effects. There is a problem with this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're at a moment right now where the US government is undercutting people's trust in science and vaccinations probably like never before in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And to coin this novel syndrome without even proving that it's caused by the vaccine is very worrisome to me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid jabs, like any vaccine or medical product, can cause side effects which can vary in frequency and severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But mRNA vaccines are estimated to have saved tens of millions of lives globally from Covid, 1.6million in Europe and 3million in the US alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are also credited with helping end the series of paralyzing lockdowns brought on by the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no figures for the number of PVS patients in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, newly released data show 18,551 claims for compensation for injuries and deaths they believe to be caused by Covid vaccines have been made in Britain as of last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These figures relate to the Government's Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It predates the Covid shots and offers some victims of vaccine injuries and deaths a one-off payment of £120,000 (about $150,000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, only just over 200 of these claims have been deemed eligible for the sum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has been widely criticised for requiring patients to be at least 60 per cent disabled by their injuries in order to qualify for a payout — for example losing a limb, a sense like your sight, or complete paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the 11,000 with an outcome about 450 were dismissed because while medics agreed a person had been injured by the jab, the case did not meet the 60 per cent disability and therefore the applicant got nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The remainder were unsuccessful because assessors found that, on the balance of probabilities, their injury or condition had not been caused by a Covid vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A further 7,000 or so applications are still awaiting an outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Within days, two of her cats had to be euthanized, and a third was in an intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All of the cats that had eaten raw pet food would later test positive for bird flu. Only a male cat kept apart from the others and fed canned food stayed negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Knopp is an artist in Portland, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/oregon" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, who breeds and shows Cornish Rex cats. She has fed raw food to all but the male cat for years, and watched recent notices about tainted raw pet food carefully. She believed the food from Wild Coast was being tested for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I’ve since learned, I don’t think there’s really a safe way to trust if someone says they’re testing it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Wild Coast did not respond to the Guardian’s media inquiries about why the company &lt;a href="https://wildcoastpets.com/wild-coast-safety-steps-for-h5n1/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;waited a week&lt;/a&gt; to issue a voluntary recall after being notified of possible contamination, and whether it was reaching out to vendors and customers about the recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;If Knopp had known, she would have “immediately” switched to canned food – a move she now recommends to all cat owners who were feeding raw food they bought or made on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It is not safe,” she said. “Immediately: do not feed raw poultry or raw chicken, raw any table scraps, to cats currently – not even raw eggs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Raw milk is similarly risky, since milk can contain enormous amounts of virus, and raw beef has also been found to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/18/usda-dairy-cows-bird-flu-survey" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;harbor H5N1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Especially right now, feeding raw food is just all risk,” said Steve Valeika, a small-animal veterinarian with a public health background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;H5N1 joins a host of other pathogens – including salmonella, &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt;, campylobacter, listeria and toxoplasmosis – that have been associated with raw pet food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One of the most unnerving parts for Knopp: her cats never displayed the classic symptoms of respiratory infections, like congestion. Some of the cats had fevers, rapid breathing and eyelid swelling, and one eventually had difficulty walking – a sign of neurological impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But nothing pointed to influenza until X-rays revealed two of the cats with rapid breathing had developed severe pneumonia. That’s when they tested for bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Your average person probably wouldn’t take them to the vet with a minor fever that comes and goes,” Knopp said. “Your average person might not notice a sudden increase of breath rate, especially for a cat that’s maybe more reclusive. So I wonder how many cases are also under-reported.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Knopp was concerned that she might become infected and spread the virus herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-19" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-19" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;after newsletter promotion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I don’t want to be known as ‘Bird Flu Mary’,” she said. Her local health department conducted daily symptom check-ins, she started wearing face masks when she went out in public, and she requested a test to see if she had gotten sick. The result was negative for influenza A and B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In 2016, cats in a New York City shelter &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6986351/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;transmitted&lt;/a&gt; H7N2 to at least one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We know that cats can at least transmit another strain of bird flu directly to people,” Valeika said. “I do think these cats potentially present some risk to humans. We don’t have any idea how big that risk is, but it’s definitely one that should be taken seriously until we know better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It is not clear how tainted poultry is entering the raw pet food supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All facilities processing meat for humans are inspected by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While some meat intended for pets flows through FSIS-inspected facilities, “obviously, a great deal of protein is produced outside of FSIS-inspected facilities and is never intended for human consumption”, said Eric Deeble, deputy under-secretary for marketing and regulatory programs at the USDA, on 16 January during the last call health officials held with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;US officials were investigating whether any of the H5-positive pet products had gone through such a facility, he said, though no results have been released to the public yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Birds from affected flocks that are depopulated as part of USDA’s efforts to control H5N1 are not permitted in any food product at all,” Deeble said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Valeika added that he had “no good idea as to why we’re seeing so many sick birds making it into the [pet] food supply – because this must just be the tip of the iceberg”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There are other steps pet owners can take to protect animals, and themselves, from bird flu, Valeika said: don’t let cats outside, and don’t let dogs hunt or play with birds, including in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19081209/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ponds and lakes&lt;/a&gt; frequented by migratory birds. Mice and rats, especially near dairy and poultry farms, have also tested positive for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Knopp has been posting about her experiences and holding “ask me anything” sessions about cats and bird flu on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I’ve channeled a lot of grief into work and into education,” she said. For the two cats who were euthanized, she said, “their death gets to mean something. It can save other animals. It can save some people grief.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE40MTFSRWJWcWpQOUJqS0l3aWJET05rUElwNDZqWml3cS13VFkxRDZwSjJLX2pDYnNKYkc3ekhRbXdGQTJyclFOSFNTbE9DbWlfc3RsVWZ2VGItbWFvSHBtYzZRUklUbmRCTklKUE5n</guid></item><item><title>Exclusive | CrossFit-loving dad, 42, gets transplant after flu-like symptoms turn out to be end-stage heart failure - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQRmR4dGhXRy1tNjVXYUtwMF9uWWNjX2NnTFRkd2E4SnN6MXdSM3JWZXQxQkNqMDU3V2pNX2E5WVF0SEgycGx1N2RLaXI3NXd5Q0FOZjdxWldjcWdOSy1PRXlEMFNQcmE0OUd0RjRmYV9zazZSaGFTNllpSUxkeEJ2TWJzMDFHSC1jaVlWTWhuRGtlRGQtdFdTUE9VWVFGY2xYWDBHUW5ISmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;A New York City dad who suffered sudden heart failure and nearly lost his life is sharing his story of survival after a successful heart transplant, encouraging all men to “go to the doctor right away if you feel like something’s off — life is too precious to sit idly by.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nycmuseumgallery.org/1248/news/time-for-a-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/a&gt; was a 40-year-old CrossFit-loving fitness buff and school principal enjoying summer vacation when something suddenly went terribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The father of two was with his kids in his native Portugal in August 2023 when he experienced alarming flu-like symptoms he had never felt before. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I just felt very sick — I never coughed as violently — it hurt,” Rodrigues, now 42, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rodrigues’ flu-like symptoms turned out to be signs of heart failure. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At five-foot-11 and 175 pounds, Rodrigues should have been the portrait of health in the prime of his life — a clean eater who took pride in exercising with an at-home rower. But he became a shell of himself as months went by without one good day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was shocking — there was no warning,” he said. “It came on fast and furious.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He sought answers from six different doctors “to try to get to the bottom of what was happening.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the array of antibiotics and nasal sprays for a diagnosis of pneumonia and an upper respiratory infection didn’t cut down the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The physical change was dramatic as he hit 190 pounds due to the fluid retention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What I noticed was completely abnormal,” said Rodrigues, adding that discovering the appearance of abnormally swollen ankles made him fear it was a heart issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After two months of mysterious symptoms — including constant shortness of breath and exhaustion — Rodriguez darted for the Mount Sinai ER, where he stayed for 12 days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of a cold or respiratory virus, he learned that it was severe heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rodrigues was a a clean eater who took pride in exercising with an at-home rower when he got sick. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There were a lot of really scary nights in the hospital,” he said, adding that “not seeing my kids grow up was my worst thought. It’s still my worst thought and fear.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said it was myocarditis, a condition &lt;a href="https://news.yale.edu/2023/05/05/yale-study-reveals-insights-post-vaccine-heart-inflammation-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;increasingly associated with young males&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-024-00893-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Covid shot&lt;/a&gt;, which led to his heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The cause of the myocarditis is unknown,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since he had no family history of it and “genetic testing cleared me of [anything],” the doting dad felt grateful that he wouldn’t pass it down to his son and daughter, ages 9 and 11.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HIs heart was functioning at 10%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The term they use is end-stage heart failure,” he said, noting that the normal rate is 50% or higher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But under the care of Mount Sinai’s Dr. Anuradha Lala, he tried a variety of medications aimed at improving function of the heart and minimizing the rate at which his heart was deteriorating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;He learned he was in end-stage heart failure, with his heart functioning at just 10%. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Though genetic testing yielded ”no genetic basis” for his condition, the doctor told The Post. “We don’t know the exact reason that Andre had heart failure. But to me, his journey is about recognizing symptoms, knowing when to ask for help, attuning your mind to your body and coming to terms with being sick.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Building trust and a personal connection is so critical — especially for younger folks, who may just want to run away from the issue,” added Dr. Lala, Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant Cardiologist at the Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He worked closely with his team, had regular blood work and various tests done under therapeutic care, but there was no improvement. Other organs, including kidney and liver, were affected because they weren’t getting enough healthy oxygenated blood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surviving for his kids was his biggest motivation. “I was motivated to play soccer with them again and run around with them and they kept me really motivated” to get through this ordeal, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But by the fall of 2024, he needed to pivot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;He had no family history it and “genetic testing cleared me of [anything].” He was at lead glad he wouldn’t pass it down to his son and daughter, ages 9 and 11. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My heart could not bounce back and I needed to be put on the transplant list” while in Mount Sinai’s ICU and an impella was used to help his left ventricle pump.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Under the care of a team that included cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Anelechi Anyanwu, Rodrigues matched with a viable heart and underwent a successful eight-hour surgery in late October.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back at his Museum School in Chelsea, Manhattan, staff and students sent hundreds of emails and letters of support for the fourth-year principal, who forced himself to let go of his fears and put his complete faith in his team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though he doesn’t know much about his donor, he’s grateful for the “gift” that gave him life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By early January, Rodrigues was ready to return to his beloved school, where staff and students lined the hallways to welcome him back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s a wonderful community where students show so much empathy — towards one another and to me,” he said of the emotional reunion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rodrigues was ready this January to return to his beloved school, where he is the principal. Staff and students lined the hallways to welcome him back. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Andre Rodrigues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The future remains bright for Rodrigues, who noted life will be different “but also beautiful at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;And, yes, that includes CrossFit in his future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The road is still long, but nothing compared to what he was on,” added Dr. Lala, who urged the public not to write off anything that feels worrisome. “The intention isn’t to promote fear, but to instill awareness, around symptoms that should prompt further evaluation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rodrigues’ message to others is to seek medical help if something feels off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is your life. This is your life and life is too precious to sit idly and not have a proper diagnosis. And even when the diagnosis is scary, trust the medical professionals and move forward with courage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Have a positive mindset and trust the medical professionals. Keep advocating for yourself and your health.”&lt;/p&gt;

A growing body of research highlights the role &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/common-mineral-supplement-may-help-prevent-cold-and-flu-symptoms-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and minerals play in preserving cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a groundbreaking study suggests that magnesium intake could be a key factor in keeping the brain healthy and lowering dementia risk. Researchers are uncovering how this essential mineral might help slow cognitive decline, offering a simple yet powerful strategy for brain preservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-023-03123-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;European Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed data from the UK Biobank, a large-scale health database. Researchers focused on magnesium consumption and its potential impact on brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Dietary Mg intake trajectories in men and women corresponding to different subgroups of individuals identified by latent class analysis.

To estimate their daily magnesium intake, researchers used a dietary questionnaire administered five times over a 16-month span. This method allowed for a detailed assessment of each participant’s typical &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3tfwgXi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were striking. Individuals consuming more than 550 milligrams of magnesium daily had “brain ages” nearly a year younger by the time they reached 55. In contrast, those consuming the average intake of about 350 milligrams showed more typical patterns of brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study lead author Khawlah Alateeq, Ph.D., from the &lt;a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ANU National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health&lt;/a&gt;, highlighted the significance of these results. “Our study shows a 41% increase in magnesium intake could lead to less age-related brain shrinkage, which is associated with better cognitive function and a decreased risk or delayed onset of dementia in later life,” she stated in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alateeq also emphasized magnesium’s potential as an early intervention for brain health. She noted, “This means people of all ages should be paying closer attention to their magnesium intake.” Her statement underscores the importance of dietary choices long before cognitive decline becomes a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also indicated that the brain-protective benefits of increased dietary magnesium were more pronounced in women—especially those post-menopause—than in men. Alateeq theorizes that this might be attributed to magnesium's &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-explore-bioengineering-vegetables-with-anti-inflammatory-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-inflammatory properties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_vital_role_of_magnesium_in_our_diet"&gt;The Vital Role of Magnesium in Our Diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is magnesium, and why is it crucial for our brain's health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melissa Prest, D.C.N., R.D.N., a prominent national media spokesperson for the &lt;a href="https://www.eatright.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics&lt;/a&gt;, explains that magnesium, found abundantly in nuts, seeds, dairy, and leafy greens, plays a critical role in maintaining our body tissues. This includes the essential task of nerve signaling in the brain and preserving the blood-brain barrier's integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Dr Erin I.

As Prest elucidates, low magnesium levels have previously been associated with a heightened risk of brain inflammation and the onset of diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s, and multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Prest sheds light on the intricate relationship between magnesium and menopause, which might explain the gender-based differences observed in the study. “High magnesium intake in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-study-suggests-that-breastfeeding-may-help-prevent-cognitive-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;post-menopausal women&lt;/a&gt; correlates with reduced inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein, indicating reduced inflammation,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="optimizing_daily_magnesium_intake"&gt;Optimizing Daily Magnesium Intake&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults' magnesium needs can fluctuate based on factors such as age and biological sex, typically ranging from 310 to 420 mg/day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Bar graph of the associations (beta values) between dietary magnesium (Mg) trajectories and a the brain volumes including gray matter, white matter, left hippocampus, right hippocampus, and white matter lesions; and b blood pressure (BP) including mean arterial pressure (MAP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP) stratified by sex.

        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) today announced the &lt;a href="/publications/m/item/recommended-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2025-2026-northern-hemisphere-influenza-season"&gt;recommendations for the viral composition of influenza vaccines for the 2025-2026 influenza season in the northern hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;. The announcement was made at an information session at the end of a 4-day meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines, a meeting that is held twice annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO organizes these consultations with an advisory group of experts gathered from WHO Collaborating Centres and WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories to analyse influenza virus surveillance data generated by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). The recommendations issued are used by the national vaccine regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce, and license influenza vaccines for the following influenza season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The periodic update of viruses contained in influenza vaccines is necessary for the vaccines to be effective due to the constant evolving nature of influenza viruses, including those circulating and infecting humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO recommends that &lt;strong&gt;trivalent &lt;/strong&gt;vaccines for use in the 2025-2026 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Egg-based vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;an A/Croatia/10136RV/2023 (H3N2)-like virus; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cell culture-, recombinant protein- or nucleic acid-based vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;an A/District of Columbia/27/2023 (H3N2)-like virus; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommendation for the B/Yamagata lineage component of quadrivalent influenza vaccines remains unchanged from previous recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;As an outbreak of measles &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309800/texas-measles-child-death-vaccination" target="_blank"&gt;continues to spread&lt;/a&gt; in west Texas and New Mexico, many people are wondering, how bad could it get?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Well, the first thing to know is that measles is one of the most contagious diseases on Earth — more than Ebola, smallpox or just about any other infectious disease. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Before widespread vaccination eliminated the disease in the U.S., pretty much everyone got measles in childhood. And 400-500 children used to die from it each year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the vaccine's power to beat back measles outbreaks starts to crumble when vaccination rates drop low enough. We asked scientists to help us decipher how lower vaccination rates can affect spread and what that means for the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The math of measles spread&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To understand just how easily measles spreads, it helps to know a scientific concept known as the basic reproduction number, or R naught. That's the number of people, on average, that a single infected person can transmit a disease to.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The R naught for measles ranges from 12 to 18. In other words, if one person is infected, they will infect as many as 18 others on average. That's much higher than with other infectious diseases, such as Ebola with an R naught of 2.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, R naught is a theoretical number. "It's not some magical constant," says &lt;a href="https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/justin-lessler-phd/" target="_blank"&gt;Justin Lessler&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It assumes that &lt;a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/when-will-it-be-over-an-introduction-to-viral-reproduction-numbers-r0-and-re/#:~:text=The%20effective%20reproduction%20number%2C%20Re%2C%20sometimes%20also%20called%20R,and%20also%20as%20people%20die." target="_blank"&gt;no one has immunity to a given disease&lt;/a&gt;. That's what the "naught" refers to, as in zero immunity. It's useful for comparing the infectious potential of different diseases. But in the real world, a lot of different factors can alter how easily measles transmits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This brings us to a concept known as the&lt;em&gt; effective&lt;/em&gt; reproduction number. That's the number of people that a sick person can infect in a given population at any specific time. It changes as more people become immune through infection or vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It also changes depending on how people behave. Do infected people isolate? Are vulnerable, unvaccinated people clustered together, socializing with each other? That kind of situation "gives an opportunity for the virus to exist in a place," Lessler says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And, the most effective firewall against transmission is vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The graphic below shows how much a lower vaccination rate can affect measles' spread in a theoretical group of kindergartners who cluster together every weekday in a classroom.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;If a disease has a reproduction number under 1, infections will spread slowly and an outbreak will eventually die out, because each infected person spreads it to fewer than one other person on average.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the flipside, here's where exponential case growth can happen. Let's say a measles outbreak has an effective reproduction number of 3, like in the graphic above. That might not sound so bad, until you consider that those three people can go on to infect three others, and so on and so on. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In fact, the original strain of the virus that causes COVID had a reproduction number of around 3, and we all saw how that went, says &lt;a href="https://www.huck.psu.edu/people/matthew-ferrari" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of biology and the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Penn State University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's not unreasonable to think that measles could spread as fast as [pre-vaccine] SARS-CoV-2 in populations, particularly in school settings, where kids are vaccinated at 80-85%," Ferrari says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Vulnerable Texas counties&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The kindergarten vaccination rate for measles in Gaines County, the epicenter of the current outbreak in Texas, is just below 82%. That's well below the 95% vaccination rate threshold needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Nationwide, measles vaccination rates have been falling for years and are currently at 92.7%. In some communities, kindergarten vaccination rates are much lower, creating pockets of opportunity for measles to spread.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;About half of the counties in Texas have a kindergarten vaccination rate below that 95% threshold. In Foard County, Texas, the rate stands at just under 67%. In a classroom with that vaccination rate, one infected child would infect five other unvaccinated classmates with measles on average.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;You can find even lower vaccination rates if you drill down to the school level. One private school in Fort Worth, Texas, reported a kindergarten vaccination rate of just over 14%. That's not to say the outbreak will reach places like this, but if it did, they'd be very vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lessler says many factors will determine how far this outbreak spreads and how big it gets. That includes how many people get vaccinated in response to the outbreak, whether suspected cases are quarantined, and how well contact tracing works so exposed people don't infect others.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And that's critical, because a person infected with measles can be contagious from four days before the telltale measles rash appears, until four days after, says &lt;a href="https://www.childrens.com/doctor-profile/carla-garcia-carreno" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric infectious disease specialist with Children's Medical Center Plano in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So you can be spreading it without knowing you have the measles," Carreno says. A person with measles can emit infectious particles that linger in the air for up to two hours, long after they've left the room. "That's what makes it also difficult to control."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Lessler says in conditions where under-vaccinated people are grouped together — such as the close-knit rural community &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/first-measles-death-reported-in-west-texas-outbreak-thats-infected-more-than-120-people" target="_blank"&gt;where the current outbreak is largely spreading&lt;/a&gt; — measles has the potential to cause reasonably sized outbreaks. But he thinks the firewall provided by higher vaccination and immunity levels in the broader population will eventually tamp down the  outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Are we at risk of getting, like in the old days, thousands or tens of thousands of cases from this outbreak? That's probably pretty unlikely," Lessler says. "The [vaccination] firewall is still pretty strong at that sort of broad level."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But if measles vaccination rates continue their downward trend amid &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/12/06/nx-s1-5218574/rfk-vaccines-anti-vaccine-infectious-disease" target="_blank"&gt;rising anti-vaccine sentiment&lt;/a&gt;, he says the days when measles outbreaks involve thousands of cases could return within the next five to 10 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CIBOLO, Texas — The Texas Department of State Health Services says there isn't a confirmed measles case in the San Antonio area, contrary to a spokesperson for Legacy Traditional School Cibolo tell KENS 5 on Thursday afternoon that officials had traced a confirmed case to a first-grade classroom. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school has not responded to KENS 5's follow-up questions Thursday evening. The spokesperson had said in a statement that the school would be open Friday and a "thorough sanitization of the campus" conducted. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are no confirmed cases in that area," DSHS officials said in an email. "Just because someone is being tested for measles doesn’t mean they have measles. There are a lot of different illness that cause a rash, and we want people to be thinking about measles, and we want doctors who see a patient with a rash that could be measles to have them tested."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How a measles case would be reported to DSHS depends on where a potentially diagnosed staff or student member lives. If they resided in Bexar County, a confirmed case would first be reported to Metro Health. If they lived in Guadalupe County, the school would have the burden of reporting directly to the state, DSHS said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KING COUNTY, Wash. — The first case of measles in Washington state this year has been identified in a King County infant. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County was notified of the confirmed case Wednesday and said the infant was possibly infected during recent travel abroad. Officials released a list of dates and locations where the infant was in the last few days. Anyone who was there in that timeframe could have been exposed to measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feb. 20 from 6-9 p.m.: Apple Store at Bellevue Square&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feb. 21-22 from 10:30 p.m. to 2:15 a.m.: Seattle Children's Hospital Emergency Department at Sand Point Way NE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feb. 24 from 1-4:15 p.m. Allegro Pediatrics in Bothell&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feb. 25 from 1-4 p.m.: Northwest Asthma &amp;amp; Allergy Center&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feb. 25 from 2:30-5:30 p.m.: Seattle Children's Hospital Emergency Department at Sand Point Way NE&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anyone who was at the locations at the times listed above and is not immune to measles will &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;most likely become sick between Feb. 27 – and March 18.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infant was likely not fully vaccinated because the first dose of the rubella (MMR) vaccine is typically administered between the ages of 12 to 15 months and children are eligible for the second dose at 4 years old. Infants and young children are at risk for severe disease from measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles, mumps and MMR vaccine provides about 97% protection against getting infected by measles and that protection lasts a lifetime, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes days after an unvaccinated child in Texas died from measles. It was the first measles death in the country since 2015. Measles has now been reported in at least 10 states. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How does this compare to last year?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, King County saw three confirmed measles cases. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to health officials, due to the current vaccination rate in the county it is likely there will be more frequent and larger breakouts of the highly infectious disease. Herd immunity, which helps prevent rapid spread of diseases among a large population, requires about 95% of people to be vaccinated against measles. According to King County records, 87% of 2-year-olds in the county are up to date on the MMR vaccine, and an estimated 72% of 4 to 6-year-olds have received a total of two doses of the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington state as a whole is seeing a decline in childhood vaccination rates as well. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among kindergartners, the decline was slightly sharper, with 90% receiving complete immunization in the 2019-2020 school year down to 87% in 2023-2024.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Measles symptoms&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads through the air and is highly contagious, according to the Center for Disease Control. Measles has a characteristic rash; it is red and flat, and it first appears on the face. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, other initial symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes. Tiny white spots may appear inside the mouth two to three days after those symptoms begin and before the distinct rash forms. The rash usually begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline. They then spread downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups who are most likely to experience severe symptoms include children under age 5, pregnant people and people with weakened immune systems or underlying chronic conditions, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Folks may experience difficulty producing speech or finding the right words, Amin said.

The good news is that “the risk of having a stroke can be decreased dramatically with targeted treatment,” explained Goldstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors can run scans of the brain and blood vessels, evaluate heart function, and screen for cardiovascular risk factors that increase the risk of stroke, according to Amin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Treating conditions like plaque in the arteries, heart arrhythmias, hypertension, diabetes and others can dramatically lower the risk of a future stroke, which could lead to significant disability or even death,” he noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mini-stroke-signs-symptoms_l_660d9427e4b09f580bc65ff5" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7827001"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Usually this may happen on one side of your body, said Dr. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fanikanayak%2Fmini-stroke-signs-symptoms-sc&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lmhospital.org%2Fphysicians%2Fhardik-amin&amp;amp;xcust=7827001%7CRSS&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hardik Amin;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Hardik Amin&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of neurology and medical stroke director at Yale New Haven Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss Of Vision &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person examining a pill bottle with a thoughtful expression, wearing a scarf and a sweater, highlighting focus on medication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Individuals may also experience “loss of vision in one or both eyes, or double vision,” Goldstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This doesn’t necessarily mean seeing nothing. Double vision, also known as diplopia, is when you may see two images of a single object while looking at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Face Drooping Or Numbness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An older woman in a blue shirt gently touches her face with a content expression, promoting skincare or self-care in a Goodful context&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another symptom is facial drooping, or losing muscle control on one side of your face. You may experience numbness, and it may be difficult to smile or move parts of your mouth. This can look similar to Bell’s palsy, a condition that causes the same type of facial paralysis. Though a stroke will typically lead to other symptoms as well, it’s still important to get checked immediately even if this is the only issue you’re experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arm Weakness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person in a white shirt gently holding their wrist, seated at a desk, suggesting a moment of reflection or mindfulness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Goldstein, arm weakness is another possible warning sign of a TIA. Lifting objects and holding up your arms may feel like difficult tasks, especially when you haven’t had trouble doing these things before.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Este artículo estará disponible en español &lt;a href="https://eltiempolatino.com/author/factcheck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;en El Tiempo Latino&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., head of the Department of Health and Human Services, downplayed the seriousness of an ongoing measles outbreak in Texas, falsely claiming that people had been hospitalized “mainly for quarantine” and misleadingly stating that the situation is “not unusual.” The Texas outbreak is already larger than any single outbreak last year and has led to the first measles death in the U.S. since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfigf-zGdjA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;remarks&lt;/a&gt; on Feb. 26 were his first public comments about the outbreak, which appears to have already spread to New Mexico. During a Cabinet meeting, a reporter asked President Donald Trump whether he was concerned, given &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/R8XT-4XUB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the day that an unvaccinated school-aged child had died from the viral disease. Trump asked Kennedy, who was in the room, to respond.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kennedy, Feb. 26: &lt;/strong&gt;We are following the measles epidemic every day. I think there’s 124 people who have contracted measles at this point, mainly in Gaines County, Texas. Mainly, we’re told, in the Mennonite community. There are two people who have died. We’re watching it, and there are about 20 people hospitalized, mainly for quarantine. We’re watching it, we put out a post on it yesterday, and we’re going to continue to follow it. Incidentally, there have been four measles outbreaks this year in this country. Last year, there were 16. So it’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy made no mention of vaccination. During an outbreak, offering measles vaccines to susceptible people is an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6207419/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;important strategy&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/R8XT-4XUB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;limit the spread&lt;/a&gt; of measles, which is one of the most contagious diseases. Vaccination shortly after a measles exposure can also prevent illness or reduce the severity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A measles vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;first became&lt;/a&gt; available in the U.S. in 1963. By 2000, the disease was declared eliminated, meaning measles has not been continuously spreading for a year or more in a single area. Prior to a measles vaccine, there were 3 million to 4 million cases &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;each year&lt;/a&gt; in America, with 48,000 hospitalizations and 400 to 500 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has a long &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.factcheck.org/2023/08/scicheck-factchecking-robert-f-kennedy-jr/"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of sharing inaccurate information about vaccines, including the measles vaccine. He &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/AaronBlake/status/1894792427388498329/photo/1"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a forward to a 2021 book that Americans have been “misled … into believing that measles is a deadly disease and that measles vaccines are necessary, safe, and effective.” He added that measles outbreaks “have been fabricated to create fear” to “inflict unnecessary and risky vaccines on millions of children.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As recently as last month, while denying any responsibility for a deadly outbreak of measles in Samoa in 2019, Kennedy &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-samoa-measles-kennedy-vaccines-pacific-42a9cb583c71f165699b16710884c474"&gt;falsely&lt;/a&gt; said during a &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.rev.com/transcripts/rfk-jr-confiramation-hearing-day-one"&gt;confirmation hearing&lt;/a&gt; that “most” of the people who died in the outbreak didn’t have measles and “we don’t know what was killing them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several of Kennedy’s Cabinet meeting comments are incorrect or misleading. Only one death, not two, has been reported. Children were hospitalized because they needed treatment, not “mainly for quarantine.” And while Kennedy is correct that last year there were more outbreaks than there have been so far this year, that leaves out significant context.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We were unable to identify any Feb. 25 posts from HHS or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about measles. A day after Kennedy’s remarks, however, the CDC posted a &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/723P-AZLZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on the outbreak, saying: “Vaccination remains the best defense against measles infection.” The agency said it “continues to be in close communication with Texas health authorities about the measles outbreak in West Texas, following the death of a child. HHS sends its deepest condolences to the family.” The measles death is the first in a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/woman-dies-measles-first-us-death-12-years-n385946" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt; and the first death of a child from measles in the U.S. since &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5331a3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked about the death toll discrepancy, any posts and whether Kennedy was encouraging measles vaccination, Andrew G. Nixon, HHS’ director of communications, told us in an email on Feb. 26, “CDC is aware of the death of one child in Texas from measles, and our thoughts are with the family.” He added that the agency “continues to provide technical assistance, laboratory support, and vaccines as needed” to the health departments in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services also confirmed the single death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are aware of one death associated with the outbreak,” Lara M. Anton, a senior press officer for the agency, told us in an email.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of Feb. 25, there were &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;124 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; of measles in Texas since late January, including 18 patients who have been hospitalized, according to state health officials. All but five cases have occurred in people who are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. Cases have been concentrated in and around Gaines County, a rural county with a large Mennonite population and &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lower&lt;/a&gt; measles vaccination rate. More than 100 of the cases have been in children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nine other measles cases, none of which have required hospitalization, have been reported in New Mexico as of Feb. 25, &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; the state’s health department. Officials suspect measles spread from Texas, as all the cases have occurred in a county bordering Gaines County, but the origin of the spread has &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/vaccine/2025/2/?view=2180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;not yet&lt;/a&gt; been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;False Hospitalization Claim&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not true, as Kennedy said, that the measles hospitalizations were “mainly for quarantine.” He likely meant to say isolation, which &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/answers/public-health-and-safety/what-is-the-difference-between-isolation-and-quarantine/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;refers&lt;/a&gt; to separating people who are sick from those who are healthy to prevent the spread of a disease. Quarantine refers to the separation of people who have been exposed but are not yet showing symptoms. But in either case, he’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People in the hospital are there because they need treatment,” Anton told us. “We are not quarantining anyone in the hospital. People who are not vaccinated and have been exposed are asked to isolate at home.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paul A. Offit&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us the hospital is the “last place” someone with the measles should go, unless they need care, due to the extreme contagiousness of measles and its relatively high complication rate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You do everything you can to keep measles out of the hospital because it’s a highly contagious virus and there’s a lot of vulnerable children in the hospital who are immunosuppressed and can’t be effectively vaccinated,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lara Johnson, a pediatrician and the chief medical officer at Covenant Children’s Hospital, the hospital in Lubbock, Texas, that is caring for kids with measles, including the child that died, said in an &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-dies-measles-west-texas-outbreak-rcna193812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a Feb. 26 &lt;a href="https://www.wcjb.com/video/2025/02/26/watch-lubbock-officials-give-briefing-measles-death-west-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt; that all of the hospitalized children had been admitted because of breathing issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t hospitalize patients for quarantine,” she also said, noting that the hospital provides &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/covenant-health-hospital-lubbock-confirms-000220735.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;supportive care&lt;/a&gt;, including supplemental oxygen and medicine for fevers. No measles-specific treatments &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/01/scicheck-posts-mislead-about-measles-mmr-vaccine-amid-recent-outbreaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;exist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Johnson and other hospital officials said during the briefing that their children’s hospital had admitted “about 20” kids for measles, all of whom were unvaccinated. “Several” required intensive care. In addition, a “handful” of children with measles had been seen at the emergency room, but did not need further hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Summer Davies, a doctor who cared for the child who died from measles, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/26/measles-texas-unvaccinated-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Washington Post that the child who died had developed heart problems and was put on a ventilator. The child, she said, had been previously healthy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;Misleading Claim on Significance of Outbreak&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is correct that the U.S. typically has at least a few measles outbreaks each year, and that last year there were 16. According to the CDC, there were &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://perma.cc/W6DF-42FZ"&gt;285 measles cases in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, with 198 of those cases being outbreak-related. An outbreak is defined as three or more related cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, as of Feb. 20, CDC had recorded a total of 93 cases, 86 of which had occurred in three outbreaks. (Those statistics are now out of date, as just Texas and New Mexico together have at least 133 cases.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the comparison — and the suggestion that this is all par for the course — is misleading. Not only should outbreaks be rare, experts say, but 2024 was a relatively bad year for measles. And the current outbreak has several features that make it particularly concerning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Offit called Kennedy’s statement that the U.S. has measles outbreaks every year “a little glib … as if this is acceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We eliminated measles from this country by the year 2000. With a two-dose vaccine, we eliminated the most contagious disease,” Offit said. But in part because of false information that Kennedy himself has put out for several decades, he said, a critical percentage of parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children, making outbreaks possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most parents vaccinate their children, but measles is so contagious that 95% of a community needs to be vaccinated or have prior immunity to prevent spread of the disease. A single dose of the measles vaccine is 93% &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effective&lt;/a&gt; in preventing the disease and two are 97% effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although Kennedy suggests last year’s outbreaks were normal, 2024 had the &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/W6DF-42FZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fourth highest&lt;/a&gt; tally of confirmed measles cases in the U.S. since 2000. Only 2014, 2018 and 2019 were higher. The latter two &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6817e1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; included outbreaks in Orthodox Jewish communities in New York. In 2019, such outbreaks contributed to an annual total of more than 1,200 cases, making it the worst year for measles since 1992. 2014 is when there was a large outbreak at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6406a5.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Disneyland&lt;/a&gt; in California, which also caused cases in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The current outbreak, notably, is already larger than any single outbreak in 2024 — and is still growing. Health officials in &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; both say that additional cases are “likely.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The other concerning detail is the measles death, which, as the first pediatric measles death in 22 years, is highly unusual, and has occurred after only about 124 cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Offit said the typical death rate from measles is about 1 in 1,000. It could be a fluke, but such a high death rate at this point in the outbreak could mean that it is much bigger than is being recognized.&lt;/p&gt;

Kim Schrier (D-Wash.) tore into Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Measles is highly contagious but preventable with vaccines. Asked later in the same&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;day about the unnamed child’s death during the first Cabinet meeting of President Donald Trump’s new administration, Kennedy said only that measles outbreaks are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rfk-jr-dismisses-measles-outbreak_n_67bf5519e4b053f9e3997f53" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="“not unusual”" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c0a705e4b0702663293e54" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="67bf5519e4b053f9e3997f53" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“not unusual”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and that “we have measles outbreaks every year.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Schrier, who is a pediatrician, said she was stunned by Kennedy’s response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“He’s full of, you can put four letters there,” she told HuffPost. “Starts with an ‘S.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The fact that a child has died from a vaccine-preventable disease is “devastating,” Schrier said. “And by the way, I do blame him and others like him who, for the past 20 years, have been spreading lies about vaccines, which are safe and effective.

			&lt;p&gt;The progress of a human being through life might be thought of as a mostly gradual succession of changes from the ovum to the grave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you wake up one morning, look in the mirror, and wonder when you suddenly grew so much older, you may not be imagining things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to recent research into the molecular changes associated with aging, humans experience two drastic lurches forward, one at the average age of 44 and the other at the average age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're not just changing gradually over time; there are some really dramatic changes," geneticist Michael Snyder of Stanford University &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in August 2024 when the study was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It turns out the mid-40s is a time of dramatic change, as is the early 60s. And that's true no matter what class of molecules you look at."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging is complex, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-could-be-caused-by-brain-cells-that-age-too-fast"&gt;associated with growing risks of diseases&lt;/a&gt; of all kinds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IGEEHb6gTy8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder and his colleagues have been investigating the biology of aging to better understand what changes occur and how, in order to better mitigate and treat these ailments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, they have been tracking a group of 108 adults, who have been donating biological samples every few months over several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They noticed that in&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-021-09910-5"&gt; some conditions&lt;/a&gt;, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="152619" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2308-3425/6/2/19"&gt; cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, risk doesn't rise gradually with time, it escalates sharply after a certain age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they wanted to take a closer look at the biomarkers of aging to see if they could identify related changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_132987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132987" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors.jpg" alt="An older male squatting with outstretched arms in a park" class="wp-image-132987 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonSquattingOutdoors-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132987" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The molecular changes associated with aging show that humans experience two drastic lurches forward. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEI-V1gZcw/"&gt;MixMedia/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the samples from their cohort, the researchers have been tracking different kinds of biomolecules. The different molecules studied include RNA, proteins, lipids, and gut, skin, nasal, and oral microbiome taxa, for a total of 135,239 biological features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each participant submitted an average of 47 samples over 626 days, with the longest-serving participant submitting 367 samples. This wealth of data resulted in more than 246 billion data points, which the researchers then processed, looking for patterns in the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several previous studies have found non-linear changes in molecular abundances that can be linked to aging in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(19)31091-5"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0673-2"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies of fruit flies, mice, and zebrafish have also pointed to a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging/articles/10.3389/fragi.2024.1378351/full"&gt;stepwise aging process in those species&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snyder and his colleagues noticed that there's a very clear change in the abundance of many different kinds of molecules in the human body at two distinct stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 81 percent of all the molecules they studied showed changes during one or both of these stages. Changes peaked in the mid-40s, and again in the early 60s, with slightly different profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mid-40s peak showed changes in molecules related to the metabolism of lipids,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="152619" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, and alcohol, as well as cardiovascular disease, and dysfunctions in skin and muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early 60s peak was associated with carbohydrate and caffeine metabolism, cardiovascular disease, skin and muscle, immune regulation, and kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first peak, the mid-40s, is typically when women start undergoing menopause or perimenopause, but the researchers ruled this out as a main factor: men, too, also underwent significant molecular changes at the same age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that while menopause or perimenopause may contribute to the changes observed in women in their mid-40s, there are likely other, more significant factors influencing these changes in both men and women," &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html"&gt;explained metabolomicist and first author Xiaotao Shen&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of Stanford, now at Nanyang Technological University Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Identifying and studying these factors should be a priority for future research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144095" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144095" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1.jpg" alt="A young woman's face next to an older woman's face, both are smiling" class="size-full wp-image-144095" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwoFacesAgingConcept642-1-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144095" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Changes peaked in the mid-40s, and again in the early 60s.

&lt;p&gt;Future research could help delve further into this phenomenon, studying it in more granular detail, across a wider range of subjects, to better understand how the human body changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00692-2"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in August 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infant visited several King County public locations before the diagnosis, potentially exposing others. Measles can spread before symptoms appear, and the virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential exposure sites include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency is urging  those who may have been exposed at these locations to verify their vaccination status, and to a consult a healthcare provider if they develop a fever or rash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most symptoms of measles appear between 7 to 21 days after someone has been exposed, Public Health said. Some symptoms include a high fever that can last two to four days, cough, runny nose, pink eye, and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three medical facilitates listed above are notifying patients and families who may have been exposed, providing information about the exposure date and disease symptoms to watch for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A patient who came to the Seattle Children’s Emergency Department tested positive for measles," a Seattle Children's spokesperson said in a statement to KOMO News Thursday. "Emergency Department staff members followed appropriate screening processes of the patient and their family members at the visit and quickly implemented appropriate infection control procedures, which include isolating the patient and reporting to King County Public Health. We are notifying patients and families in the Emergency Department who may have been exposed, providing information about the exposure date and disease symptoms. For privacy reasons, we do not share information about specific patient cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can be confirmed with a sample of blood or saliva in a lab. The best way to prevent the spread of measles is by making sure you are up to date on the MMR vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid possibly spreading measles to others, do not go to a clinic or hospital without calling first to tell them you want to be checked for measles after an exposure. It is also important to limit contact with others, especially those without known immunity, and to wear a well-fitting mask if you do need to go to a healthcare facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/child-dies-measles-texas-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-deadly-illness-rfk-jr-department-state-health-services-snohomish-county-health-department-doh" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/child-dies-measles-texas-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-deadly-illness-rfk-jr-department-state-health-services-snohomish-county-health-department-doh" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Child dies in measles outbreak in Texas as Washington officials urge vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most likely period for symptom onset is Feb. 27 to Mar. 18  for those exposed and not immune. Measles is contagious from about four days before a rash appears through four days after a rash appears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health also emphasized the importance of the measles vaccine for the community at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles is easily spread from person to person. If one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected," said Dr. Eric Chow, Communicable Disease Chief for Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County. "We are seeing increases in measles cases within and outside the US. Talk to your doctor about checking your vaccination status and get vaccinated now if you aren’t already protected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency explained the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is highly effective, with two doses providing about 97% protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herd immunity requires approximately 95% vaccination coverage due to measles' high contagion rate. Currently, an estimated 87% of 2-year-olds and 72% of 4–6-year-olds in King County are up to date with their MMR vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, King County reported three measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information about measles and measles vaccination, including where to get measles vaccinations, can be found on King County's &lt;a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/measles" target="_blank" title="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/measles" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WEBSITE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can measles be fatal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It usually doesn’t kill people, but it can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven’t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis — which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s deadly “in a little less than 1% of cases, mainly in children,” said Scott Weaver, who works at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. “Children develop the most severe illness. The cause of death in these kinds of cases is usually pneumonia and complications from pneumonia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you need a booster if you got the MMR vaccine a while ago?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care professionals are sometimes tested for antibodies to measles and given boosters if necessary, Weaver said — even if they’ve already had the standard two doses as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may also want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I don’t think everyone needs to go and run out to their doctor right now if they did receive two doses as a child,” he said. "If people would just get the standard vaccination, none of this would be happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 23:45:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2wJBVV95cUxQYjBDOEZIckVIUktZOE1QaWpGREl1VzEtbXFPUlFwbHBZRDlILXk3ZUwwYVRudnV2b2M0VkVWYjRjSm1pZkdvYy1BdUFERU5uUUp5OHBZaVZSaVhXcE80QjdQaFdXVFpsTlo4RFlPT3dsb2JDNVFzQ2pzZlFnSFBJOWd4eUNUY0xjQVU2RFNOcHZqTGVkT2djOEZna2g2QmpDMUtlM21kbjY5VXJqZE44TGFqdnhhelQyTUh1aGIxdWl0bnYzbUoxU0ZWTnVmbW9VOHJ4UXNBc1J2UFpQbkdhRUJoZmVTdmNzZ3hvWUp5WUU2VFhlSkhmclNBeXlmWHZBaHoxNXVjenJpUHc0ZlVqV0JTWWl1NUtzbERWck9kcEdQZDUwb0ZuX0Rfei1YS01MSG45ODJNdEd1MnRkOXdrYmVNdTN4dWVFOVNRdER0RTloUnBXTDAzM1dTdw</guid></item><item><title>First measles case confirmed in San Antonio area from first-grade classroom, school says - KENS5.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi6gFBVV95cUxOR1A0YVpmbklLSldfbnc4N182Q0NBN2FTSE9oNnlCMVZqZlZyLWY1N3lHbGozazBMMUp2SjVnQXRKTWpOTl90RVNwSnlMQzRuWlZncDZnOHFWU2x5Q210Nlg3b0g1V2dCQUdpR1hLcXlLci1rSTRDS1R5a3pneU5tbnFCRFlmWGJfa2Q0TGlNV2dFQlZmWFNFXzVzeFUyX000c2p6cUlWUnluSjdXNUc2VmVRTXE3V0ZuM2ZQTEFjUWxoc2JKZDJQU3U5cnUzM19Hb3A5WTQ1Qy1tRzh0ak44N01WWUJQVGRMR2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;The Legacy Traditional School in Cibolo has confirmed with KENS 5 that there is a measles case in a first-grade classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CIBOLO, Texas — The first measles case in the San Antonio area has been confirmed, with officials tracing it to a first-grade classroom at Legacy Traditional School in Cibolo.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson with the charter school told KENS 5 it was taking "all the necessary precautions" following the measles detection. School officials are reportedly working with state and local health officials to monitor the situation and "ensure the wellbeing of the school community."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the school said it will remain open on Friday and conduct a "thorough sanitization of the campus" after school hours.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Families who have been directly notified should continue to follow the guidance provided. We appreciate our community's patience, trust, and cooperation as we navigate this situation,"&lt;em id="isPasted"&gt;&lt;em id="isPasted"&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the Legacy Traditional School - Cibolo said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Friday, the Texas Department of State Health Services was &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;reporting 124 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt;, mostly in the South Plains region of West Texas. Most of them involved unvaccinated children, although five people who are vaccinated have been among the cases, according to health officials. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Vaccine exemptions among children in Gaines County, the epicenter of the outbreak, have grown dramatically in the past few years. Roughly 7.5% of kindergarteners had filed an exemption for at least one vaccine in 2013. 10 years later, that number rose to over 17.5% – one of the highest in all of Texas, state health data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As the response to the outbreak in Texas and New Mexico continues, with cases expected to significantly rise, public health experts like Hotez and Offit say they're watching Kennedy, as leader of the nation's health department, to encourage swift surveillance and widespread vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"I want him to say to the American public that there's a safe way to prevent these outbreaks from happening so that we don't have the tragedy like what just happened in West Texas," Offit said.

But drugmakers can’t actually start making the doses until the FDA selects the strains. Shots &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-shot-when-covid-vaccine-rcna169364" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:are usually available by the end of July or early August;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;are usually available by the end of July or early August&lt;/a&gt;, said Litjen Tan, co-chair of the flu shot advocacy group the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The advisory committee meeting plays a key role, Tan said, because the flu virus is constantly evolving, requiring updates to the vaccine to provide the best protection. This year’s FDA flu meeting was scheduled for March 13, with a final decision from the agency on the strain expected shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Tan said that depending on the vaccine technology used, manufacturers can wait until late March for input from the FDA on strain selection to produce enough doses for the fall — but no longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If the strain selection happens much later than now, it’s going to be really, really tight, but the manufacturers will scramble and can make it happen,” Tan said. “If the delay is any longer than late March, it’s going to put manufacturers into a huge bind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The cancelation of the meeting comes amid a particularly bad flu season this year, with as many as 910,000 hospitalizations so far, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

Typically, the agency must provide two weeks’ notice of a meeting to allow for a public comment period, meaning any advisory committee meeting likely wouldn’t happen until mid-March at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, a committee member and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said agency officials offered no explanation for the canceled meeting, nor did they indicate whether it would be rescheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“What worries me about this, I think it’s part of the bigger picture, which is this sort of dissolution of public health infrastructure, that we don’t need experts anymore,” said Offit, who helped develop a vaccine for rotavirus that was later sold to drugmaker Merck. “We don’t need experts advising us at the CDC, we don’t need experts advising us from the FDA. We’ll just figure it out ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Earlier this month, federal health officials &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-vaccine-committee-meeting-kennedy-postponed-hhs-rcna191659" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:also abruptly postponed a CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;also abruptly postponed a CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Asked whether he’s concerned about next season’s flu shot supply, Offit said, “I think we’ll have a flu vaccine this year, although I guess I shouldn’t say anything because everything seems unimaginable, and yet it still happens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone over 6 months old. Data so far show that this year’s flu vaccine is 63% to 78% effective for preventing hospitalization in children and teens, and 41% to 55% effective for adults, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm?s_cid=mm7406a2_w" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC reported Thursday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC reported Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If drugmakers don’t have enough time to produce the vaccines because of the canceled meeting, “many lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost,” said Dr. Tin Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This decision — and other federal efforts to undermine well-established science about vaccine safety — puts everyone at risk, especially when we are currently experiencing the worst U.S. flu season in more than a decade,” Tin Tan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Flu vaccine manufacturers are still preparing for next year’s flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a statement, a spokesperson for Sanofi said it has “already begun production for the 2025-2026 flu season in the Northern Hemisphere and will be ready to support final strain selections in time for the season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A spokesperson for GSK, another flu vaccine manufacturer, said it’s aware of the canceled meeting and is continuing to work with the FDA on its flu strain recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-shot-supply-fall-short-year-fdas-canceled-meeting-sparks-worries-rcna194031" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NBCNews.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;NBCNews.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 23:01:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE0xSG0zbTVtS0FZdC00Q3R6ZDgxMUE3LURIUUFvTWxiaWR4dmE4OHVudU1vLUUxVGFqckRvejJHSEpSUGFVOVh5aXg1RXU1OXNEN2N3NWR3RUNTUVhvNF96S2I5d0t3VlFLVjNyUUFrM3NqeUk5YTlR</guid></item><item><title>Harsh flu season has health officials worried about brain complications in children - The Associated Press</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQcHQwU0ZwbkNPaFhHbFYxbFJ3VTVTaGNLM09IbURhb2hpUzlJWXIxMGo4R3RwY19KYnphLVNrOXlvUFlabnBDN0l1X2FRSW94STF6Y0tTaTlvU25lS25KU3NYMmRMX0NkVXAxZVBEV2NOaFFLa0JmYjFnTXZmWlJRNnF0YVBOWEpBbEpNZE1DNTBLMzlnVEJFUlEwekNYUGdlQWxN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Associated Press</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 22:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQcHQwU0ZwbkNPaFhHbFYxbFJ3VTVTaGNLM09IbURhb2hpUzlJWXIxMGo4R3RwY19KYnphLVNrOXlvUFlabnBDN0l1X2FRSW94STF6Y0tTaTlvU25lS25KU3NYMmRMX0NkVXAxZVBEV2NOaFFLa0JmYjFnTXZmWlJRNnF0YVBOWEpBbEpNZE1DNTBLMzlnVEJFUlEwekNYUGdlQWxN</guid></item><item><title>Brain Map Reveals Early Signs of MS Before Symptoms Appear - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXEFVX3lxTE9MNkhSMUFYU24yLXRlYXNQN0x0aGNRdHFpcG5LSm1GMVA3eS1ZWkhjTG5Mc0JUa0tUcG82NHZoemc1SlZRbW9RMnN4ZHBUOG1GSEhMOE5tMWJ0UV9q?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have created a four-dimensional brain map that reveals how MS-like lesions form, providing new insights into the earliest stages of the disease.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by postdoctoral fellow Jing-Ping Lin, Ph.D., and senior investigator Daniel S. Reich, M.D., Ph.D., both at NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), combined repeated MRI imaging with brain-tissue analysis, including gene expression, to track the onset and development of MS-like lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They uncovered a new MRI signature that can help detect brain regions at risk for damage weeks before any visible lesions occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also identified “microenvironments” within affected brain tissue based on observed patterns of neural function, inflammation, immune and support cell responses, gene expression, and levels of damage and repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying the early events that occur after inflammation and teasing apart which are reparative versus which are damaging, can potentially help us identify MS disease activity sooner and develop treatments to slow or stop its progression,” said Dr. Reich.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS is caused by the body’s immune system attacking the protective covering of nerve fibers, called myelin. This leads to inflammation, loss of myelin, and formation of “lesions” or “plaques” within the brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of what is known about MS progression has come from analysis of postmortem human brain tissue, usually obtained decades after the initial onset of disease. This means missing early changes that occurred prior to the onset of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To mimic the conditions of the human brain, the researchers opted not to use a mouse model for MS, instead advancing a model that uses the marmoset, a nonhuman primate. Compared to mouse brains, marmoset and human brains have a higher ratio of white matter (the “wires” of the brain) to gray matter (neuronal cell bodies).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The marmoset model creates multiple lesions that closely resemble those seen in human MS and that can be tracked in real time using MRI imaging. Because these lesions can be induced experimentally, the model offers a look at the earliest stages of inflammation and immune responses that lead to MS-like demyelination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key player identified was a specific type of astrocyte, one of the support cell types in the brain, that turns on a gene called &lt;em&gt;SERPINE1&lt;/em&gt; or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (&lt;em&gt;PAI1&lt;/em&gt;). They found SERPINE1-expressing astrocytes in vulnerable brain borders before visible damage occurs, clustering near blood vessels and the fluid-filled ventricles of the brain and signaling future areas of lesion development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These astrocytes also appeared to influence the behavior of other cells near the lesion area, including the ability of immune cells to enter the brain and contribute to inflammation, as well as the precursor cells involved in myelin repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that SERPINE1-expressing astrocytes accumulated at the edges of growing lesions, where damage happens but healing also begins, their potential dual role in coordinating signals that could lead to either tissue repair or further damage was an unexpected wrinkle that will require further study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that the earliest responses could be a part of a protective mechanism that becomes overwhelmed as the injury progresses. It’s also possible that the same mechanism could itself become disease-causing.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If one imagines a fort under siege, initially the walls might hold off the attack,” said Dr. Reich. “But if those walls are breached, all the defenses inside can be turned against the fort itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings may also have implications for brain injuries beyond what is seen in MS. While there are different types of focal brain injuries, including traumatic brain injury, stroke, inflammation, and infection, there is a finite number of ways the tissue can react to injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, many of the reactions seen here to inflammation, stress, and tissue damage are likely to be common across injury types, and the brain map created in this study can act as a resource to allow comparisons to be made in a more human-like context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific teams are building a new model of a different autoimmune condition affecting brain borders. They are also looking to expand their data set to include aged animals, which could help improve our understanding of progressive MS, a disease state with a significant and unmet therapeutic need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was supported in part by the Intramural Research Program at the NIH with additional support from the Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G.

The precise cause of MS remains unclear, but the disease involves an inappropriate immune response and subsequent failure to repair myelin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although MS therapies have been effective in controlling peripheral inflammation, understanding the cellular dynamics of lesion progression during early phases is crucial for developing treatments that promote timely remyelination and repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RATIONALE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current understanding of MS pathology is largely derived from postmortem human tissue studies or rare brain biopsies, which capture disease at a single, often late, time point. To address this limitation, we used a clinically relevant model, the common marmoset (&lt;em&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/em&gt;) with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), to study MS-like lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model closely mimics MS lesion development and evolution, offering insights that are transferable to the clinical setting. Although structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is noninvasive and effective for monitoring lesion changes, it lacks the specificity required to reveal the cellular and molecular diversity within lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we integrated longitudinal MRI, histopathology, spatial transcriptomics, and single-nucleus RNA profiling to examine the signaling profiles involved in lesion development and resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified five microenvironment (ME) groups—related to neural function, immune and glial responses, tissue destruction and repair, and regulatory networks at brain borders—that emerged during lesion evolution. Before visible demyelination, astrocytic and ependymal secretory signals marked perivascular and periventricular regions, which later became demyelination hotspots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified an MRI biomarker, the ratio of proton density–weighted signal to &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; relaxation time, which was sensitive to the hypercellularity phase preceding myelin destruction. At lesion onset, we observed a global shift in cellular connectivity, particularly in extracellular matrix–mediated signaling. Early responses involved the proliferation and diversification of microglia and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As lesions developed, EAE-associated glia were replaced by monocyte derivatives at the lesion center, with persistent lymphocytes seen in aged lesions. Concurrently with demyelination, reparative signaling modules appeared at the lesion edge as early as 10 days after lesion establishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also noted an overrepresentation of genes involved in the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) at the brain borders and the formation of concentric glial barriers at the lesion edge, prompting perturbation analysis to contextualize EAE-associated changes and identify potential therapeutics to protect tissue and enhance repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified a SERPINE1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; astrocytic subtype, acting as a secretory hub at the perivascular and periventricular zones, which underlies the onset of lesions in both marmoset EAE and MS. Our work offers a spatiotemporally resolved molecular map as a resource to benefit MS research and to guide identification of candidates for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 22:21:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTE9MNkhSMUFYU24yLXRlYXNQN0x0aGNRdHFpcG5LSm1GMVA3eS1ZWkhjTG5Mc0JUa0tUcG82NHZoemc1SlZRbW9RMnN4ZHBUOG1GSEhMOE5tMWJ0UV9q</guid></item><item><title>Ontario measles cases nearly double count marking largest increase in almost 30 years - BarrieToday</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0AFBVV95cUxONVhFMW1qVWFybU5GVk1JV01YenYtTHhROXdEaDgtX0JxTFNxVW1WNFhYWUQ1eS1GUVRKWGg5SjdPRi11MXByQ2R2Y2F6MHp4LVFac3c1alEzRFhXVVRjMEk2ZFR6aDc2bHYzVW1VRnpFeW81bXV2RGJ3alBOdW1HOWlYZXZMUnFORWljQzRfX0wxOXJfTmZWV29ZTW9UYThXR0gzTE9Sc3Vka1N6RWd4N2tMY3c5emVRUkQ4QUVycHNHYXd3UWNKcFF1Z3NKbzdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="details-body" class="details-body clearfix" data-words="580" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;TORONTO — Ontario identified 78 new measles cases over the course of two weeks, public health officials said Thursday, calling it the largest outbreak the province has seen in almost 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new cases bring Ontario's total this year to just over 140, far surpassing the 101 total infections recorded in the province between 2013 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sarah Wilson, a public health physician with Public Health Ontario, said the last time there was a sizable outbreak in the province was 2008 when there was a total of 58 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the largest measles outbreak that we've experienced in the province of Ontario since measles was eliminated from Canada in 1998," Wilson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all of the new cases are connected to an interprovincial outbreak that began in October, which has sickened 177 people in Ontario and also saw the virus spread in New Brunswick and Manitoba. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The epicentre of Ontario's outbreak has been in neighbouring Southwestern and Grand Erie public health regions. Wilson said the concentration of cases in unvaccinated people could explain how quickly the outbreak spread over the last two weeks. Quebec has also reported an outbreak of 27 cases that began in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the outbreak, 18 kids have been hospitalized in Ontario, including one who required intensive care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly contagious — but preventable — airborne disease has primarily infected children and teenagers who are unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the cases reported Thursday was in an unvaccinated child who acquired measles outside of Canada and required hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the country, Public Health Agency of Canada is reporting 77 cases this year, but its latest data is outdated and only spans to Feb. 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is also seeing measles spreading, marking its first measles death in a decade Wednesday after an unvaccinated child died in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases in the world. Each patient with measles can transmit the virus to another 16 to 18 people, said Janna Shapiro, a post-doctoral fellow at the Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases affiliated with the University of Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason, it usually serves as a sign of what's to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Whenever vaccination rates start to go down, we get worried about measles because it's the first thing that's going to come back because it's so, so, so contagious. That is also what allows these outbreaks to grow faster than other types of outbreaks," Shapiro said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It usually begins with a fever, cough, runny nose and red watery eyes, followed by a red blotchy rash that starts on the face and spreads to the body and limbs. The virus can lead to pneumonia, inflammation of the brain and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada eliminated measles in 1998, which required a low level of transmission for at least a year and 90 to 95 per cent vaccination coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're now at risk of losing our elimination status in Canada if these outbreaks continue," Shapiro said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With March Break around the corner, she said airports and planes are opportune places for the virus to spread, and vaccination is the best path of protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's a misconception for some people that measles is not a serious disease. And measles very much is a serious disease," Shapiro said.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Drugs can't stop Alzheimer's disease yet. But sometimes, they can slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Things have just plateaued," says Myra Solano Garcia, 66, who developed memory problems in her 50s, and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I can drive. I can take care of the house, I can cook," she says, "all of that normal stuff that people do."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia credits the drug &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/10/g-s1-3818/fda-advisors-back-alzheimer-drug-donanemab-despite-risks" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;donanemab&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which she began taking as part of a clinical trial at the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, now marketed as Kisunla, in July of 2024. It's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5300930/did-an-alzheimers-drug-give-sue-and-ken-bell-more-time-maybe" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one of two drugs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; approved since 2023 that can clear the brain of sticky amyloid plaques, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But there is no way to know whether Kisunla is the reason Solano Garcia can still do so much.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We don't have the ability to say because you've taken the medication, you haven't declined," says &lt;a href="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/lon-schneider/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Lon Schneider&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at USC's Keck School of Medicine who oversaw the donanemab trial there.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both Kisunla and the other approved drug, Leqembi, have been shown to slow down the mental decline of Alzheimer's by more than 25%. But that's in a group of patients—an individual may do much better, or not be helped at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A life, interrupted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia grew up in New Jersey as part of a Cuban-American family with lots of singers. She studied piano and voice in college. As a young adult, she made singing her career.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I played Maria in West Side Story in summer stock," she says. "I performed at Carnegie Hall and Fisher Hall."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Later, she moved to California and ran fundraising campaigns for colleges and universities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was in her early 50s that Solano Garcia began noticing problems with her memory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A doctor told her she had attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and for years she mistakenly thought that was the problem. But her memory kept getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The turning point came during COVID, when she started a new job.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Three months in, I realized I couldn't do the work," she says. "I couldn't remember the people's names. I couldn't do the technology."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So Solano Garcia went to a neuropsychiatrist, who diagnosed her with Alzheimer's disease and referred her to doctors at USC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They asked, 'Would you like to be part of the [donanemab] trial?' and I said, you bet I would," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A brain cleared of plaques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia began going in for monthly infusions, which she didn't mind, and mental tests, which she found frustrating. When the trial ended, she opted to continue taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It hasn't restored her memory or thinking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Solano Garcia says she isn't getting worse, at least not very quickly. Also, scans show that the beta-amyloid plaques that had built up in her brain are mostly gone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That means she may be able to stop getting infusions of Kisunla.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studies showed that it's safe for doctors to "treat until plaques are down to normal and then stop, and perhaps re-treat if plaques begin to grow back," USC's Schneider says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This option is one of the key differences between Kisunla and Leqembi, which was administered throughout its clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So at USC, doctors have a weekly meeting to discuss how patients are doing on Kisunla, and whether they might be candidates to stop taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia says doctors told her she's one of those patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm almost done with the infusions, so it's really exciting," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Still no cure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia knows her brain is not what it once was.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I don't do well with numbers," she says. "I have difficulty remembering names. My poor husband, I forget what he tells me."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She's not able to return to her fundraising career. And she has lost much of her command of the piano.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So Solano Garcia maintains her household, runs errands, and volunteers with the Alzheimer's Association.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She also makes a weekly visit to a local memory care, where she sings for, and with, the residents.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We start out with the Star Spangled Banner, and we do some movie songs," she says, and "Coming 'Round the Mountain."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia says she's learned a lot from people in the unit, most of whom have advanced Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's humbling because they used to know all of this music," she says. "And I know that as time goes, I'll be just like them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But she's hoping that Kisunla will postpone that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The strangely adorable and resilient tardigrade, or water bear, just might hold the key to making cancer treatment a lot more (water-) bearable. That’s because a team of researchers just found evidence that a protein produced by these microscopic creatures could protect our healthy cells from the ravages of radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at MIT, the University of Iowa, and elsewhere conducted the new study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01360-5"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this Wednesday in &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;. In experiments with mice, the research team observed that the protein reduced radiation damage in normal cells, while still allowing the radiation therapy to target cancerous cells. The findings could someday lead to an invaluable add-on treatment for many cancer patients, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tardigrades are extremophiles, notorious for their remarkable ability to survive some of the most inhospitable conditions on Earth (and space). One of the conditions the hardy critters evolved to withstand is extreme doses of radiation—thousands of times more than a human can handle—and one of the tricks they use to resist that radiation is the production of something called the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6773438/"&gt;damage suppressor protein&lt;/a&gt;, or Dsup. This protein, as the name implies, is thought to suppress radiation-induced DNA damage by binding to DNA strands and preventing them from breaking apart as usual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research team decided to test whether it was possible to safely transfer the tardigrade’s body armor against radiation to other animals, starting with mice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using mRNA technology, the team made it possible for certain cells in its mice to temporarily produce Dsup (only a few hours), then they exposed the cells to radiation. The researchers specifically chose cells lining the mouth and rectum, since radiation is commonly used to treat cancers in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Just as with tardigrades, the team’s mice appeared to have added protection against radiation damage, the researchers found. In experiments with mice that had oral cancer, they also demonstrated that the mRNA therapy didn’t impair radiation’s ability to kill off nearby tumor cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The strategy may be broadly applicable to the protection of healthy tissue from DNA-damaging agents,” the researchers wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Of course, this research still is a long way from being applicable to human cancer patients, and it will take more study and tweaking to make this technology safe and practical for medical use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scientists plan to create an upgraded version of the protein that’s less likely to provoke an unwanted response from our immune system, for instance. Researchers elsewhere have also &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/new-species-of-tardigrade-displays-superhero-like-healing-ability-2000516253"&gt;recently discovered &lt;/a&gt;tardigrades that are even more resistant to radiation, suggesting that Dsup isn’t the only radiation-proofing tool we can borrow from them. But if the team’s work does continue to progress, it could eventually provide widespread benefits to the roughly &lt;a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/01/17/radiation-therapy-for-cancer-pain-relief/#:~:text=%22Radiation%20therapy%20is%20typically%20used,helping%20to%20ease%20agonizing%20aches."&gt;50 to 60% of cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; who undergo radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The protein could even possibly be used to protect astronauts from space-related radiation or to protect cancer patients from other sources of treatment-induced DNA damage, such as chemotherapy drugs, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Radiation can be very helpful for many tumors, but we also recognize that the side effects can be limiting,” study co-author Giovanni Traverso, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT and a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, told &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/tiny-tardigrades-protein-may-help-cancer-patients-tolerate-radiation-therapy-0226"&gt;MIT News&lt;/a&gt;. “There’s an unmet need with respect to helping patients mitigate the risk of damaging adjacent tissue.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tardigrades have long been one of the most fascinating animals around because of their manifold invulnerabilities. If we’re lucky, we might one day harness a bit of that superpower for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Researchers analyzed data from over 73,000 individuals using wearable devices to track their activity levels, providing objective measurements of movement and sedentary behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with higher energy expenditure were 14% to 40% less likely to develop these conditions, while more time spent sitting increased disease risk by up to 54%. These findings suggest that promoting physical activity could be a key strategy in reducing the burden of neurological and mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower Disease Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; People with higher physical activity levels were 14% to 40% less likely to develop dementia, stroke, anxiety, depression, or sleep disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sedentary Behavior Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; More time spent sitting increased disease risk by 5% to 54%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective Tracking:&lt;/strong&gt; The study used wearable devices for accurate measurements, reducing reliance on self-reported activity data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who get moderate to vigorous physical activity may be less likely to develop dementia, stroke, anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders, according to a preliminary study released today, February 27, 2025, that will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s 77th Annual Meeting taking place April 5–9, 2025, in San Diego and online.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the more time people spent sitting, the more likely they were to develop one of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research highlights the role of physical activity and sedentary behavior as modifiable factors that may enhance brain health and reduce the incidence of these diseases,” said study author Jia-Yi Wu, MD, of Fudan University in Shanghai, China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is promising to think that encouraging people to make these lifestyle changes could potentially lessen the burden of these diseases in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt; &lt;iframe title="How Exercise Protects Your Brain from Aging and Disease" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/01Yh8fPpUDw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video Credit: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a large United Kingdom database, researchers looked at data from 73,411 people with an average age of 56 who wore accelerometer devices continuously for seven days to measure their physical activity, how much energy they used on their activities and how much time they spent sitting each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic equivalents (METs) were used to quantify energy expenditure. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was defined as activities with an energy expenditure of at least three METs, where walking or cleaning was three METs and more intense exercise like cycling could be around six METs, depending on speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who had moderate to vigorous physical activity energy expenditure were 14% to 40% less likely to develop the five diseases than those who had lower energy expenditure, depending on how active they were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people who did not develop any of the diseases had an average daily moderate to vigorous physical activity energy expenditure of 1.22 kilojoules per kilogram, compared to 0.85 for the people who developed dementia, 0.95 for those who developed sleep disorders, 1.02 for stroke, 1.08 for depression and 1.10 for anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more time people spent sitting, the higher their risk of developing one of the diseases, with the increase ranging from 5% to 54% higher than those who spent the least amount of time sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some previous studies have relied on people reporting on their own levels of activity,” Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With our large number of participants and the use of devices that provide objective measurements of activity levels, these results will have implications for assessing risk factors and developing interventions to prevent the development of these diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that 96% of the participants were white people, so the results may not apply to other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was supported by grants from the Scientific and Technological Innovation 2030 – “Brain Science and Brain-inspired Artificial Intelligence” Major Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this exercise and brain health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f381879680809e929db392929ddd909c9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Renee Tessman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Renee Tessman – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s 77th Annual Meeting&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 21:39:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE0wSDBWam5ULUVZOGVhQ3oxeDk3Wnd3Y25UTllzMUptcGZaMWFoNWNTV0E0WFVweEZUdjVIU1Ztb3pUWDg2cTBzWTB2RFo2OTRZSnlnSWlYNXMwbTJaeVNveEtwUmNsaFFiMFBHVWdUWFROQ05MUFBF</guid></item><item><title>Early mRNA vaccine trial results show potential breakthrough in fighting one of the deadliest cancers - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxNdnFKQnRMQVpyZU9FcDlnRk1LNVlabnVWSjgyZnRLWW84ZW1scjZuREx3UTREZmhnRVN5ck05Zk1iMUIxR2d0WWw3WE9mdGxORUIyRlIzOXVEQzVxa1EyUFFzaHZ0SjZRekFyNF8tNnVUYnRUaWRmQ1R2cDIzX3ZUZ3VIWG9ldUVjNEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-cy="article-image" class="sc-1b197338-7 iqAtsy"&gt;&lt;img alt="A woman wearing a head wrap gets a vaccine from a masked doctor" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=320&amp;amp;q=75 320w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=384&amp;amp;q=75 384w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=480&amp;amp;q=75 480w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=576&amp;amp;q=75 576w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=768&amp;amp;q=75 768w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=1024&amp;amp;q=75 1024w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=1280&amp;amp;q=75 1280w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=1440&amp;amp;q=75 1440w" src="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1370802802-e1740688381832.jpg?w=1440&amp;amp;q=75"&gt;&lt;p data-cy="caption" class="sc-13b6974d-9 dKtuAn"&gt;Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers.

Encephalitis is swelling of the brain, while encephalopathy is a more general term for brain dysfunction that is not primarily an inflammatory condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANE in 4 cases this season&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors said the CDC began receiving reports of ANE in children who died from flu in January, and the agency contacted state health departments to ascertain whether any pediatric flu-related deaths with IAE also involved a diagnosis of ANE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of February 8, the most recent date used in the study, 68 US children had been confirmed to have died from seasonal influenza. Among them, 9 had IAE (13%). (As of the CDC's latest FluView report &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/us-flu-still-high-covid-low-elevated-some-areas-rsv-declining-cdc-says"&gt;&lt;u&gt;on February 21&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, US pediatric flu deaths had risen to 86.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors said that, of the 9 pediatric deaths this season with IAE, 4 patients had fatal ANE. All 4 ANE deaths involved children under the age of 5 years, and all had laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H1N1). Two of the 4 children had been vaccinated against flu, 2 received the antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu), and all required mechanical ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-four percent of patients with fatal IAE had no underlying medical conditions, and only 20% had received flu vaccination 2 or more weeks before illness onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unknown if numbers are to be expected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors compared IAE and ANE records among pediatric influenza deaths seen in the past 15 years. From the 2010-11 to 2024-25 flu seasons, officials reported 1,840 US pediatric flu-associated deaths, of which 166 (9%) involved IAE, ranging from 0% (2020-21 season) to 14% (2011-12 season).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 166 fatal pediatric flu-related patients with IAE, the median age was 6 years, 52% were female, and 40% were non-Hispanic White. In total 119 patients (72%) had influenza A, and 46 (28%) had influenza B virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of IAE patients (93%) required mechanical ventilation. Other documented acute complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (57; 34%), pneumonia (54; 33%), and sepsis (47; 28%). All but 11 patients died while hospitalized.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because no dedicated national surveillance for IAE or ANE exists, it is unknown if the numbers of cases this season vary from expected numbers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because no dedicated national surveillance for IAE or ANE exists, it is unknown if the numbers of cases this season vary from expected numbers," the authors wrote. "Health care providers should consider IAE in children with febrile illness and clinically compatible neurologic signs or symptoms, including but not limited to seizures, altered mental status, delirium, decreased level of consciousness, lethargy, hallucinations, or personality changes lasting &amp;gt;24 hours."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent research revealed that &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.16.24302894v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;60%&lt;/a&gt; of Americans’ daily caloric intake comes from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/lifestyle/ultraprocessed-foods-are-everywhere-how-bad-are-they/"&gt;ultra-processed foods.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;UPFs often contain high levels of sodium, refined sugars, cholesterol-spiking fats and other lab-based ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/05/lifestyle/expert-sounds-the-alarm-on-popular-foods-americans-eat-posing-serious-health-risks/"&gt;A recent study &lt;/a&gt;linked exposure to UPFs to 32 poor health outcomes, including a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/29/lifestyle/junk-food-hikes-risk-of-32-diseases-and-health-conditions-including-death-scientists/"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/11/24/lifestyle/new-evidence-that-ultra-processed-foods-are-linked-to-cancer-study/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, metabolic syndrome, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/06/lifestyle/eating-predigested-junk-foods-is-making-you-fatter-experts-warn/"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, Type 2 &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/30/ultra-processed-food-linked-to-early-death-health-problems-scientists/"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and even premature death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study suggests that many of those adverse effects might be dangerously easy to acquire and shockingly long-lasting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;UPFs often contain high levels of sodium, refined sugars, cholesterol-spiking fats and other lab-based ingredients. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;beats_ – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Institute for Diabetes Research and Metabolic Diseases of the Helmholtz Center Munich at the University of Tübingen in Tübingen, Germany, found that even in the short term, consuming a high-calorie, UPF-rich diet impairs brain insulin responsiveness and increases liver fat in healthy men.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, and worse? These effects linger long after the eating period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Insulin regulates appetite and metabolism, and insulin resistance — like the kind triggered by UPFs — compromises this regulation and contributes to obesity, Type 2 diabetes and cognitive dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;The German team also found a link between ultra-processed food consumption and disruption in the brain’s reward learning response, suggesting that as little as five days of overeating can condition the brain for unhealthy eating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the study, 29 healthy male participants between 19 and 27 were divided into a high-caloric diet (HCD) group or a control group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over five days, the HCD group was told to eat additional daily calories from ultra-processed snack foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The control group maintained their regular diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study aimed to assess insulin-induced brain activity during three moments: before the high-caloric diet, during it, and one week after subjects went back to eating normally. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The research team found that brain insulin responsiveness increased for the group eating a high-caloric diet. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;On average, the HCD group increased their daily caloric intake by 1,200 calories. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Liver fat content in that group increased dramatically, while brain insulin responsiveness increased as well. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One week after resuming a regular diet, insulin activity was significantly lower in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An earlier study published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2799140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt; found that people could be at a higher risk of cognitive decline if more than 20% of their daily caloric intake is ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the German study, researchers were stunned at the effect short-term HCD had on reward learning, the process by which the brain learns to associate behaviors or stimuli with a positive or negative outcome and modify accordingly. This process is pivotal to motivation, decision making and food choices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To measure the relationship between HCD and reward learning, participants completed a task to assess their sensitivity to reward and punishment and the brain’s efficacy in processing and adapting to feedback.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;After a scant five days of eating UPFs, the HCD group displayed decreased reward sensitivity and increased punishment sensitivity. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Nelli Kovalchuk – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;After a scant five days of eating UPFs, the HCD group displayed decreased reward sensitivity and increased punishment sensitivity. After a week of normal eating, this trend abated but did not fully reverse itself. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Data suggest that a short-term HCD, rich in sugar and saturated fat, has prolonged effects on the brain that outlast the time-frame of its consumption,” according to the research team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Habitual daily intake of sweet and fatty snacks has been shown to increase neural responses to food, while decreasing the preference for low-fat food independent of changes in body weight and metabolism.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the study is gender specific and more research is needed, the team posits, “the brain response to insulin adapts to short-term changes in diet before weight gain and may facilitate the development of obesity and associated diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult-obesity-facts/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; defines obesity as having a body mass index of at least 30, and a shocking 20% of Americans meet that criteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly 60% of US adults with obesity have high blood pressure, and approximately 23% have diabetes. People with obesity are at a higher risk for a slew of health problems, including heart and liver disease on top of a multitude of chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

But drugmakers can’t actually start making the doses until the FDA selects the strains. Shots &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-shot-when-covid-vaccine-rcna169364" target="_blank"&gt;are usually available by the end of July or early August&lt;/a&gt;, said Litjen Tan, co-chair of the flu shot advocacy group the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The advisory committee meeting plays a key role, Tan said, because the flu virus is constantly evolving, requiring updates to the vaccine to provide the best protection. This year’s FDA flu meeting was scheduled for March 13, with a final decision from the agency on the strain expected shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Tan said that depending on the vaccine technology used, manufacturers can wait until late March for input from the FDA on strain selection to produce enough doses for the fall — but no longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“If the strain selection happens much later than now, it’s going to be really, really tight, but the manufacturers will scramble and can make it happen,” Tan said. “If the delay is any longer than late March, it’s going to put manufacturers into a huge bind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The cancelation of the meeting comes amid a particularly bad flu season this year, with as many as 910,000 hospitalizations so far, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. At least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-07.html" target="_blank"&gt;86 children and 19,000 adults have died&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a statement, Andrew Nixon, a senior spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, said the agency will “make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Nixon didn’t answer questions about why the meeting was cancelled or whether the agency would seek input from its outside advisory committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children’s Hospital, who has advised the FDA on vaccines, said that if the agency decides not to seek input from its committee, it won’t be entirely in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On Friday, a World Health Organization advisory committee is &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2025/02/28/default-calendar/who-information-meeting-on-the-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2025-2026-northern-hemisphere-influenza-season" target="_blank"&gt;convening to decide which strains should be included in next season’s flu vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for the Northern Hemisphere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That meeting usually guides the FDA’s strain selection, Levy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“FDA has the authority to advance flu vaccines without convening the VRBPAC committee,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear, however, whether drugmakers can begin producing doses for the U.S. based on the WHO’s recommendation or if they must wait for the FDA’s guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It also remains to be seen whether the FDA will reschedule its advisory committee meeting or forgo input on the flu strains from its expert panel altogether — which would be a first for the agency, according to Tan. Typically, the agency must provide two weeks’ notice of a meeting to allow for a public comment period, meaning any advisory committee meeting likely wouldn’t happen until mid-March at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, a committee member and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said agency officials offered no explanation for the canceled meeting, nor did they indicate whether it would be rescheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“What worries me about this, I think it’s part of the bigger picture, which is this sort of dissolution of public health infrastructure, that we don’t need experts anymore,” said Offit, who helped develop a vaccine for rotavirus that was later sold to drugmaker Merck. “We don’t need experts advising us at the CDC, we don’t need experts advising us from the FDA. We’ll just figure it out ourselves.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Earlier this month, federal health officials &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-vaccine-committee-meeting-kennedy-postponed-hhs-rcna191659" target="_blank"&gt;also abruptly postponed a CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Asked whether he’s concerned about next season’s flu shot supply, Offit said, “I think we’ll have a flu vaccine this year, although I guess I shouldn’t say anything because everything seems unimaginable, and yet it still happens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone over 6 months old. Data so far show that this year’s flu vaccine is 63% to 78% effective for preventing hospitalization in children and teens, and 41% to 55% effective for adults, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm?s_cid=mm7406a2_w" target="_blank"&gt;CDC reported Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If drugmakers don’t have enough time to produce the vaccines because of the canceled meeting, “many lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost,” said Dr. Tin Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“This decision — and other federal efforts to undermine well-established science about vaccine safety — puts everyone at risk, especially when we are currently experiencing the worst U.S. flu season in more than a decade,” Tin Tan said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Flu vaccine manufacturers are still preparing for next year’s flu season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a statement, a spokesperson for Sanofi said it has “already begun production for the 2025-2026 flu season in the Northern Hemisphere and will be ready to support final strain selections in time for the season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;A spokesperson for GSK, another flu vaccine manufacturer, said it’s aware of the canceled meeting and is continuing to work with the FDA on its flu strain recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 21:01:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxPeklBU2drV09oQmpndXh1M3ZlZi1qSGVNYjBSNzh0LXpoTGZGQ1B1eHRxajB4Qm0wckozSWJmdmwwQldpMllnaHBQak5DUmFEa0lQSC1UVzZrbEM0eXpLTlh3QmczNms5Ml9nUElnV29SbzRWVnRxS0pmb1MwdU0zcTI3WUJuR3FSWUIwUDdBLUJja3BLY0o1NUVlUlVhd2Z0MzZObkZpM1RmS3hDSXduUTNZaUZEU1FqQUFEZmpfa9IBVkFVX3lxTFBFUkg1STRTNlJBdzhWR1BhRFdLQjRBY09IRzQwbXJmQ3hqR1RyZ1I3Mjdrd2lHZGo2YW1ldHEyM3hQQnlWN0I1dUVMOFFTSHpObktmeXZR</guid></item><item><title>Infant from Orange County arrived at LAX with measles - ABC 10 News San Diego KGTV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNeHNuc0JfWFFrY2JxbFJmN3gxYWs3NXdWYnB2eGRzVi1VaXZheHpjVDRGeFNJM2lfNlZta2JiczRSMVJzUk1xWHRHcjF3d3owbTd5X1JrTVE2aGRnQU9GbTJ4YXZORjJtaUpYODlTQV9CWlBITzE3RHB3dTlaZ3V6SWJiWTMxaGhF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (CNS) - An Orange County infant infected with measles arrived at Los Angeles International Airport following overseas travel earlier this month, and health officials started notifying passengers who were on the flight they had an increased risk of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, the patient arrived at LAX's Tom Bradley International Terminal on Feb. 19 aboard Korean Air flight KAL11/KE11. Health officials said anyone who was at Terminal B that day between 1 and 4 p.m. may be at risk of developing measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials were working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to notify passengers who were sitting in specific seats on the flight that may have increased their risk of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles County health department did not release any specifics about the patient, but the Orange County Health Care Agency issued a statement saying it is an infant who was returning home to Orange County following international travel. Orange County officials said there were no additional community exposures beyond the airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who potentially may have been exposed were urged to confirm their vaccination status or possible immunization through prior infection. Those who are not immune could be at risk of developing measles between seven and 21 days from exposure, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles is a serious respiratory disease that spreads easily through the air and on surfaces, particularly among people who are not already protected from it," Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County Health Officer, said in a statement. "A person can spread the illness to others before they have symptoms, and it can take seven to 21 days for symptoms to show up after exposure. Measles can lead to severe disease in young children and vulnerable adults. The best way to protect yourself and your family from infection is with the highly effective measles vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common symptoms of measles include a high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, tiny white spots inside the mouth, and a rash that develops three to five days after other signs of illness, starting at the face then spreading to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, 93 measles cases have been reported in the United States this year, but the number is likely to rise due to current outbreaks occurring in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025, City News Service, Inc.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

NIH study reveals key players underlying disease onset and repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an animal model of &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;multiple sclerosis (MS)&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have created a four-dimensional brain map that reveals how lesions similar to those seen in human MS form. These findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, provide a window into the early disease state and could help identify potential targets for MS treatments and brain tissue repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by postdoctoral fellow Jing-Ping Lin, Ph.D., and senior investigator Daniel S. Reich, M.D., Ph.D., both at NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), combined repeated MRI imaging with brain-tissue analysis, including gene expression, to track the onset and development of MS-like lesions. They uncovered a new MRI signature that can help detect brain regions at risk for damage weeks before any visible lesions occur. They also identified “microenvironments” within affected brain tissue based on observed patterns of neural function, inflammation, immune and support cell responses, gene expression, and levels of damage and repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Identifying the early events that occur after inflammation and teasing apart which are reparative versus which are damaging, can potentially help us identify MS disease activity sooner and develop treatments to slow or stop its progression,” said Dr. Reich.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS is caused by the body’s immune system attacking the protective covering of nerve fibers, called myelin. This leads to inflammation, loss of myelin, and formation of “lesions” or “plaques” within the brain tissue. Most of what is known about MS progression has come from analysis of postmortem human brain tissue, usually obtained decades after the initial onset of disease. This means missing early changes that occurred prior to the onset of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mimic the conditions of the human brain, the researchers opted not to use a mouse model for MS, instead advancing a model that uses the marmoset, a nonhuman primate. Compared to mouse brains, marmoset and human brains have a higher ratio of white matter (the “wires” of the brain) to gray matter (neuronal cell bodies). The marmoset model creates multiple lesions that closely resemble those seen in human MS and that can be tracked in real time using MRI imaging. Because these lesions can be induced experimentally, the model offers a look at the earliest stages of inflammation and immune responses that lead to MS-like demyelination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key player identified was a specific type of astrocyte, one of the support cell types in the brain, that turns on a gene called &lt;em&gt;SERPINE1&lt;/em&gt; or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (&lt;em&gt;PAI1&lt;/em&gt;). They found SERPINE1-expressing astrocytes in vulnerable brain borders before visible damage occurs, clustering near blood vessels and the fluid-filled ventricles of the brain and signaling future areas of lesion development. These astrocytes also appeared to influence the behavior of other cells near the lesion area, including the ability of immune cells to enter the brain and contribute to inflammation, as well as the precursor cells involved in myelin repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that SERPINE1-expressing astrocytes accumulated at the edges of growing lesions, where damage happens but healing also begins, their potential dual role in coordinating signals that could lead to either tissue repair or further damage was an unexpected wrinkle that will require further study. It’s possible that the earliest responses could be a part of a protective mechanism that becomes overwhelmed as the injury progresses. It’s also possible that the same mechanism could itself become disease-causing.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If one imagines a fort under siege, initially the walls might hold off the attack,” said Dr. Reich. “But if those walls are breached, all the defenses inside can be turned against the fort itself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings may also have implications for brain injuries beyond what is seen in MS. While there are different types of focal brain injuries, including traumatic brain injury, stroke, inflammation, and infection, there is a finite number of ways the tissue can react to injury. In fact, many of the reactions seen here to inflammation, stress, and tissue damage are likely to be common across injury types, and the brain map created in this study can act as a resource to allow comparisons to be made in a more human-like context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientific teams are building a new model of a different autoimmune condition affecting brain borders. They are also looking to expand their data set to include aged animals, which could help improve our understanding of progressive MS, a disease state with a significant and unmet therapeutic need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study was supported in part by the Intramural Research Program at the NIH with additional support from the Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G. Adelson Medical Research Foundation and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ST. LOUIS COUNTY, Mo. — Researchers at Washington University identified the first invasive longhorned tick ever found in &lt;a href="/article/sports/outdoors/where-to-send-ticks-bite-st-louis-county-illinois-reporting/63-26825545-04ed-4455-a1a8-a09b7699d1b8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;suburban St. Louis County&lt;/a&gt;, the university said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sesame-seed-sized arachnid is considered a "serious threat," according to the &lt;a href="https://agriculture.mo.gov/veterinarians/longhorned-tick-flier.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Missouri Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;. The tick has transmitted diseases to domestic animals and livestock in Australia, New Zealand and multiple countries in eastern Asia. It has also killed animals from blood loss during severe infestations.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WashU undergraduate researcher Sam Ko collected and identified the tick in the county.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have only found one longhorned tick in St. Louis County so far, but it’s likely that there are more,” said &lt;a href="https://www.adalsteinssonlab.org/people"&gt;Solny Adalsteinsson&lt;/a&gt;, who leads the Tyson Research Center's tick and wildlife ecology team.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The university said it is working to expand tick collection efforts throughout the region after the find and will partner with St. Louis County's "&lt;a href="/article/sports/outdoors/where-to-send-ticks-bite-st-louis-county-illinois-reporting/63-26825545-04ed-4455-a1a8-a09b7699d1b8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Tick Watch STL&lt;/a&gt;" program, which allows residents to send in ticks to Vector Borne Disease Prevention in Olivette.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county also published a public dashboard for the tick collection program which includes a map of tick collection locations and detailed information of each type of tick.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to give residents the tools to make decisions in their best interest and let them know that we are here for them when they have questions or need support,” said J. Brooke Dedrick, a vector-borne disease prevention specialist with St. Louis County’s Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missouri does not have a state-wide tick submission program, but it does allow residents to report certain tick-borne diseases and conditions to local health agencies or the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;a href="https://health.mo.gov/living/healthcondiseases/communicable/communicabledisease/pdf/reportablediseaselist2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Click here to learn more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

These are the North Texas schools most and least at risk of a breakout infection. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DALLAS — A measles case was reported in North Texas on Wednesday, bringing the statewide total of reported measles cases to 125, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children ages 5 years old and younger are at the highest risk of serious health complications caused by measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control. State officials on Wednesday said a school-aged child &lt;a href="/article/news/health/texas-measles-death-outbreak-lubbock/285-636380ac-1d18-4404-999d-b804f40137af" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;died in Lubbock&lt;/a&gt;. The child, whose exact age was not released, was hospitalized last week and tested positive for measles. While one death has been reported, 18 people have been hospitalized in West Texas, officials say. The unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles in Rockwall County is also hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and symptoms usually begin 7 to 14 days after infection, the CDC said. The disease spreads through infected droplets in the air and the virus can remain infectious up to two hours after an infected person leaves.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is "probably the most infectious contagious disease on the planet," said Dr. Suzanne Whitworth, division chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Cook Children's in Fort Worth&lt;a href="/article/news/health/answers-to-your-questions-and-general-guidelines-on-measles-outbreak-in-texas/287-48e4c451-22e5-403b-b810-bfda235c3d03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt; previously told WFAA.&lt;/a&gt; "We know that about 40% of kids under the age of five who get measles are gonna wind up in the hospital, and nobody wants that." &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination is the best defense against measles, according to the CDC. The vaccine to protect against measles is the MMR vaccine, which covers measles, mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public and private schools are required to report the percentage of vaccinated children to the Texas Department of Health and Human Services. The department's data shows that 187 public school districts and private schools had a kindergarten measles (MMR) vaccination rate of less than 95% in the 2023-2024 school year. Herd immunity for measles is achieved when 95% of the population is vaccinated, according to the World Health Organization. Herd immunity is achieved when enough community members are immune to a virus so that it inhibits spread. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, kindergarten vaccination rates only tell a portion of the story. Herd immunity is only achieved when the entire community has a vaccination rate of over 95%. Communities with lower vaccination rates are at greater risk of a breakout of measles infections, according to the&lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/what-to-know-about-measles-and-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; Johns Hopkins School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all public and private North Texas schools, ten private schools had the lowest vaccination rate for measles (the MMR vaccine) last school year: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 62 North Texas schools had a 100% vaccination rate among kindergartners in the 2023-2024 school year. Here are the measles vaccination rates for every North Texas school and public school district. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_embed"&gt;
                                    
                                &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of Health and Human Services also breaks down school-age vaccination rates by county. According to the latest data from the 2023-2024 school year, zero North Texas counties have a kindergarten measles vaccination rate high enough to achieve herd immunity. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wise County had the lowest kindergarten vaccination rates relative to other North Texas counties, according to Texas Department of Health and Human Services data. Rockwall County, which so far has the only reported measles infection in North Texas, had a kindergarten vaccination rate of 91% during the 2023-2024 school year. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson and Dallas counties had the highest vaccination rate, around 94%.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_embed"&gt;
                                    
                                &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statewide, the kindergarten measles vaccination rate has steadily declined, from nearly 97% in 2019 to 94.3% last school year. If you're concerned about your school-age child or loved one becoming infected, Dr. Whitworth reminds families the vaccine has saved countless lives.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Make sure the parents; vaccines are up to date, make sure the siblings' vaccines are up to date. If grandparents are keeping those kids, make sure the grandparents' vaccines are up to date,"&lt;a href="/article/news/health/answers-to-your-questions-and-general-guidelines-on-measles-outbreak-in-texas/287-48e4c451-22e5-403b-b810-bfda235c3d03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; Whitworth previously told WFAA&lt;/a&gt;.

The most serious of those is in west Texas, where the virus is spreading largely among the Mennonite community in which rates of vaccination are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Nine states in total have reported cases of measles. In addition to Kentucky and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, that includes Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Steven Stack, who heads the public health department in Kentucky, urged people to get vaccinated. He pointed out that rates of vaccinations among Kentucky kindergartners was only 90%, lower than the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world. Vaccines are an essential tool to keep children and adults safe and healthy,” Stack said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The growing challenge of measles comes as a notorious vaccine skeptic has just become the top US health official.

He said that the measles epidemic was being followed by the government “every day”, but then appeared to try to minimize the seriousness of the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It’s not unusual.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is already known about this topic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC routinely monitors influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all eligible persons aged ≥6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is added by this report?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interim 2024–2025 seasonal influenza VE estimates were derived from four U.S. VE networks. Among children and adolescents, VE was 32%, 59%, and 60% in outpatient settings (three networks) and 63% and 78% against influenza-associated hospitalization (two networks). Among adults, VE was 36% and 54% in outpatient settings (two networks) and 41% and 55% against influenza-associated hospitalization (two networks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the implications for public health practice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination with the 2024–2025 influenza vaccine reduced the risk for influenza-associated outpatient visits and hospitalization. These findings support recommendations that all eligible persons aged ≥6 months should receive an annual influenza vaccination. Vaccination should be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="abstract" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Abstract"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months in the United States. Interim influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated among patients with acute respiratory illness–associated outpatient visits and hospitalizations from four VE networks during the 2024–25 influenza season (October 2024–February 2025). Among children and adolescents aged &amp;lt;18 years, VE against any influenza was 32%, 59%, and 60% in the outpatient setting in three networks, and against influenza-associated hospitalization was 63% and 78% in two networks. Among adults aged ≥18 years, VE in the outpatient setting was 36% and 54% in two networks and was 41% and 55% against hospitalization in two networks. Preliminary estimates indicate that receipt of the 2024–2025 influenza vaccine reduced the likelihood of medically attended influenza and influenza-associated hospitalization. CDC recommends annual receipt of an age-appropriate influenza vaccine by all eligible persons aged ≥6 months as long as influenza viruses continue to circulate locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="introduction" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Introduction"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of continual evolutionary changes in influenza viruses, CDC regularly monitors* influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). Influenza vaccination prevents hundreds of thousands of outpatient medical visits, tens of thousands of hospitalizations, and thousands of deaths from influenza every year.&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends annual seasonal influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;). In March 2024, after the absence of detections of influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses since 2020,&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt; the Food and Drug Administration recommended changing from a quadrivalent vaccine (including four influenza virus antigens) to a trivalent vaccine, containing three influenza virus antigens. During the 2024–25 influenza season, most influenza viruses detected in the United States were influenza A viruses (97% of positive specimens); among subtyped influenza A–positive specimens, 52% were influenza A(H3N2), and 47% were A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt; This report provides interim estimates of effectiveness of any 2024–2025 influenza vaccine (i.e., trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine, or trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine) against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza for persons in the outpatient and inpatient settings from four U.S. VE surveillance networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="methods" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Methods"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Data Source and Collection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyses were conducted using data from four CDC-affiliated VE networks, all of which use a test-negative, case-control design to evaluate influenza VE: 1) Investigating Respiratory Viruses in the Acutely Ill (IVY), 2) the New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN), 3) U.S. Flu Vaccine Effectiveness (U.S. Flu VE), and 4) the Virtual SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and Other respiratory viruses Network (VISION). These analyses include child and adolescent and adult patients who received medical care (outpatient or inpatient) for an acute respiratory illness (ARI) during the 2024–25 influenza season. Case-patients were those persons with ARI who received a positive influenza molecular assay test result,** and control patients were those with ARI who received a negative influenza molecular assay test result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setting and age of enrolled patients differed by network (&lt;a id="B1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#B1_down"&gt;Box&lt;/a&gt;). IVY enrolled hospitalized patients aged ≥18 years. NVSN enrolled child and adolescent patients (aged 6 months–17 years) in the outpatient setting,&lt;sup&gt;††&lt;/sup&gt; as well as those admitted to a hospital. U.S. Flu VE enrolled child and adolescent (aged 8 months–17 years) and adult (≥18 years) patients in the outpatient setting. VISION included child and adolescent (aged 6 months–17 years) and adult (aged ≥18 years) patients in the outpatient setting and those admitted to a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Data Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess effects of vaccination on likelihood of influenza illness, VE was estimated as (1 − adjusted odds ratio) × 100% using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for geographic region, age, calendar time of illness, and other prespecified confounders.&lt;sup&gt;§§&lt;/sup&gt; Patients were considered to be vaccinated if they received ≥1 dose of the 2024–2025 seasonal influenza vaccine ≥14 days before the date of ARI onset or clinical encounter.&lt;sup&gt;¶¶&lt;/sup&gt; Patients were excluded*** if they were vaccinated &amp;lt;14 days before the index date or had received a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay test result (&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;). IVY, NVSN, and U.S. Flu VE calculated VE against influenza A virus subtypes A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), when possible. VE point estimates for each network are reported, with 95% CIs included in the tables of this report; 95% CIs that exclude zero were considered statistically significant. For each network and patient age group, VE and 95% CIs were interpreted as the percentage of specific influenza outcomes prevented. SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and R (version 4.4; R Foundation) were used to conduct the analyses. IVY, NVSN, and U.S. Flu VE activities were reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and were conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.&lt;sup&gt;†††&lt;/sup&gt; VISION activities were reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.&lt;sup&gt;§§§&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="results" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Results"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from the IVY network included 3,175 hospitalized adult patients aged ≥18 years with ARI (&lt;a id="T1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T1_down"&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt;) (Supplementary Table 1, &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/176587"&gt;https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/176587&lt;/a&gt;). NVSN included 4,611 patients aged &amp;lt;18 years with ARI, including 2,969 seen in outpatient settings and 1,642 who were hospitalized. Among 3,344 patients with ARI in the outpatient setting included in the U.S. Flu VE network, 1,134 were patients aged &amp;lt;18 years, and 2,210 were adults. VISION data included 139,558 outpatient encounters (36,919 among patients aged &amp;lt;18 years and 102,639 among adults) and 32,671 hospitalized encounters (1,638 among patients aged &amp;lt;18 years and 31,033 among adults).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Influenza Vaccination Status Among Control Patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among control patients (i.e., those patients with ARI and a negative influenza test result) aged &amp;lt;18 years, the percentage vaccinated ranged from 22% (VISION) to 34% (NVSN) in outpatient settings, and from 27% (VISION) to 40% (NVSN) in the inpatient setting (&lt;a id="T2_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T2_down"&gt;Table 2&lt;/a&gt;). Among all adult control patients, the percentage vaccinated was 34% in outpatient settings (U.S. Flu VE and VISION) and ranged from 35% (IVY) to 39% (VISION) in the inpatient setting. Among control patients aged ≥65 years, 54% (VISION) to 59% (U.S. Flu VE) in outpatient settings and 45% (IVY) to 46% (VISION) in the inpatient setting were vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;VE against ARI in Outpatient and Inpatient Settings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Children and adolescents.&lt;/b&gt; Among persons aged &amp;lt;18 years, VE against any influenza-associated ARI was 32% (U.S. Flu VE), 59% (NVSN), and 60% (VISION) in outpatient settings and 63% (NVSN) and 78% (VISION) against influenza-associated hospitalization. Against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, VE was 72% (NVSN) and 53% (U.S. Flu VE) in outpatient settings, and 63% (NVSN) against influenza-associated hospitalization. Against influenza A(H3N2), VE was 42% (NVSN) in outpatient settings and 55% (NVSN) against influenza-associated hospitalization. The estimate of VE in outpatient settings in the U.S. Flu VE network was not statistically significant (16%; 95% CI = −34% to 49%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adults.&lt;/b&gt; Among persons aged ≥18 years, VE against any influenza-associated ARI was 36% (U.S. Flu VE) and 54% (VISION) in outpatient settings and 41% (IVY) and 55% (VISION) against influenza-associated hospitalization. Effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was 42% in outpatient settings (U.S. Flu VE) but was not statistically significant against influenza-associated hospitalization in the IVY network (39%; 95% CI = −14% to 67%). Effectiveness against influenza A(H3N2) was 51% (IVY) against influenza-associated hospitalization but was not statistically significant in the outpatient setting (25%; 95% CI = −6% to 48%, U.S. Flu VE network).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among adults aged 18–64 years, VE against any influenza-associated ARI in outpatient settings was 37% (U.S. Flu VE) and 56% (VISION); VE against hospitalization was 48% (IVY) and 51% (VISION). Among adults aged ≥65 years, VE against any influenza-associated ARI was 51% (VISION) in outpatient settings and was 38% (IVY) and 57% (VISION) against hospitalization; VE was not statistically significant in the outpatient setting in the U.S. Flu VE network (VE = 18%; 95% CI = −69% to 60%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Genetic Characterization of Influenza Viruses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of February 3, 2025, a total of 286 influenza A(H3N2) viruses were genetically characterized, including 26 (9%) from patients in IVY, 200 (70%) from the U.S. Flu VE network, and 60 (21%) from NVSN; all belonged to the hemagglutinin (HA) clade 2a.3a.1, which includes the A(H3N2) strain selected for the 2024–2025 cell-grown influenza vaccine (A/Massachusetts/18/2022) (Supplementary Table 2, &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/176590"&gt;https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/176590&lt;/a&gt;) Among 158 sequenced A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, five (3%) were from IVY, 80 (51%) were from the U.S. Flu VE network, and 73 (46%) were from NVSN. Among these, three from IVY, 55 from U.S. Flu VE, and 46 from NVSN belonged to HA clade 5a.2a, and two from IVY, 25 from U.S. Flu VE, and 27 from NVSN belonged to HA clade 5a.2a.1. The HA clade 5a.2a.1 includes the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain selected for the 2024–2025 cell-grown influenza vaccine (A/Wisconsin/67/2022).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="discussion" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Discussion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These interim estimates of 2024–25 VE indicate that influenza vaccination was effective in preventing medically attended influenza-associated illness in children, adolescents, and adults in the United States. Among children and adolescents, VE against medically attended influenza ranged from 32% to 60% in outpatient settings and from 63% to 78% against influenza-associated hospitalization. Among adults, VE against medically attended influenza was 36% and 54% in two outpatient settings and 41% and 55% against influenza-associated hospitalization. Despite increased circulation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses, which are generally associated with lower VE (&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;), estimates from this influenza season were consistent with those from the 2023–24 season and seasons associated with higher VE over the last 15 years (&lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;). These estimates are also similar to interim estimates from Canada for the 2024–25 influenza season, which estimated VE to be 54% overall (&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt;), and estimates from South America for the 2024 southern hemisphere influenza vaccine, which estimated VE against influenza A to be 34% overall (&lt;i&gt;6&lt;/i&gt;). Given the high levels of influenza activity and severity in the United States this season, increasing influenza vaccination could reduce influenza-associated illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations and deaths.&lt;sup&gt;¶¶¶&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VE estimates and associated confidence levels included in this report might reflect regional variations in circulating viruses. In U.S. Flu VE, most subtyped influenza A specimens (67%) were influenza A(H3N2) compared with 48% in NVSN. The U.S. Flu VE network did not find statistically significant VE against influenza A(H3N2) in the outpatient setting among child and adolescent patients or among adult patients. The VE estimates against influenza A(H3N2) are similar to findings from the 2018–19 season (&lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt;) and to findings from Europe during the 2024–25 influenza season (&lt;i&gt;8&lt;/i&gt;). To address evolutionary changes in the influenza virus, the composition of influenza vaccines is reviewed annually; influenza vaccines are updated to protect against the influenza viruses that data indicate are most likely to be circulating during the following influenza season. When circulating viruses are antigenically different from the vaccine viruses, influenza VE can be reduced.****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, these VE estimates are preliminary, and end-of-season estimates might be different as influenza continues to spread during the 2024–25 season. Second, influenza vaccination status might be misclassified in some networks, which could affect VE estimates. Vaccines administered in pharmacies are routinely reported to jurisdictional immunization information systems (IISs), although vaccination clinics conducted in nontraditional settings such as workplaces might not be reported to IISs. Third, patients who had received ≥1 dose of the 2024–2025 influenza vaccine were considered vaccinated; however, children aged 6 months–8 years are recommended to receive 2 doses if they have not previously received ≥2 doses. Therefore, some children who were classified as vaccinated might not have been fully vaccinated, which could reduce VE estimates. Finally, the potential for unmeasured confounding exists, because networks did not control for variables such as previous vaccination, previous influenza virus infection, or underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Implications for Public Health Practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza and influenza-associated hospitalization. Findings in this report show that vaccination with the 2024–2025 influenza vaccine reduced the likelihood of medically attended influenza and support CDC’s recommendation that all persons aged ≥6 months be vaccinated against influenza (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;). These findings also support the strong protective effect influenza vaccination has against influenza-associated hospitalization, demonstrating the importance of vaccination to reduce more severe influenza-associated complications. Eligible persons aged ≥6 months who have not received the 2024–2025 influenza vaccine should get vaccinated as long as influenza viruses circulate locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

* Aged 6 months–17 years (NVSN and VISION); 8 months–17 years (U.S. Flu VE).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; VE was estimated using the test-negative design comparing odds of receipt of 2024–2025 influenza vaccination among persons with an acute respiratory illness who received a positive influenza test result with those among persons who received a negative influenza or SARS-CoV-2 test result. ORs were estimated using logistic regression; VE was calculated as (1 − adjusted OR) × 100%. Firth logistic regression was used for estimates from IVY&lt;br&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt; All networks were adjusted for geographic region, age, and calendar time. IVY, U.S. Flu VE, and VISION were adjusted for sex and race and ethnicity.&lt;br&gt;
** As of February 1, 2025, most influenza viruses detected have been influenza A viruses (97% of positive specimens).&lt;br&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Doctors around the US have anecdotally reported an uptick of children critically ill with the flu developing severe, life-threatening neurological complications, which can be marked by seizures, delirium, hallucinations, decreased consciousness, lethargy, personality changes, and abnormalities in brain imaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's long been known that the seasonal flu can cause such devastating complications in some children, many with no underlying medical conditions. But doctors have begun to suspect that this year's flu season—&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/sick-right-now-flu-is-resurging-to-yet-a-higher-peak-this-season/"&gt;the most severe in over 15 years&lt;/a&gt;—has taken a yet darker turn for children. On February 14, for instance, health officials in Massachusetts released &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/influenza-neurologic-complications-advisory-february-14-2025/download"&gt;an advisory for clinicians&lt;/a&gt; to be on alert for neurological complications in pediatric flu patients after detecting a "possible increase."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the anecdata coming in, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed all the data it has on neurological complications from flu this year and seasons dating back to 2010. Unfortunately, existing surveillance systems for flu do not capture neurological complications in pediatric cases overall—but they do capture such detailed clinical data when a child dies of flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a3.htm?s_cid=mm7406a3_w"&gt;An analysis of that data&lt;/a&gt;, published today in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, can't definitively say that this year is out of the norm. For one thing, the flu season is not yet over. But the data so far does suggest it may be one of the more severe seasons in the last 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the CDC received reports of a severe neurological complication called influenza-associated acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE). ANE is a severe form of the more general category of influenza-associated encephalopathy or encephalitis (IAE), meaning brain dysfunction or inflammation from the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a child dies of the flu, clinicians are required to fill out a standardized case report form from the CDC, which collects a large variety of data, including complications. Encephalopathy or encephalitis are included as a checkbox on the form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 2010 and February 8, 2025, 1,840 children died of the flu. Of those, 166 had IAE checked off as a complication. IAE was most prevalent in children aged 2 to 4 but affected children in all age groups under 18. More than half of the cases (54 percent) had no underlying medical conditions, and most (80 percent) were unvaccinated against the flu.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr.'s reaction to a rising number of measles cases in Texas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "There's a growing measles outbreak in Texas, which has claimed the life of a school-aged kid who'd not been vaccinated. It's the first measles-related death in a decade because they eradicated it, they got rid of it so we wouldn't have to deal with it," the 69-year-old said at the top of Thursday's live Hot Topics discussion, before criticizing RFK Jr.'s insistence that "there's no cause for alarm" before playing a clip of him saying that he's "following the measles epidemic every day."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Goldberg alleged that RFK Jr. spread false information amid his response to the outbreak, particularly taking issue with his assessment that the development wasn't unusual.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Actually, it is unusual, because it was eradicated. You're not giving out the proper information. This is your job, dude. People are gonna die if they believe what you're saying and they don't check. I'm very worried about this reaction," Goldberg continued. "It's kind of like, 'Yeah, this is not a big deal.' It is a big deal and it's a big deal for mothers, expectant mothers, mothers that don't even know that they're pregnant. They have no idea. To flippantly put it off and say that this is what happens all the time — it doesn't. So, what are you going to do about it, RFK? What are you gonna do?"

&lt;p&gt;When dermatologist Dr. Nicholas Perricone unveiled a diet he promised would act as a “three-day nutritional facelift” in his bestselling book, “&lt;a href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWrinkle-Cure-Unlock-Cosmeceuticals-Youthful%2Fdp%2F0446677760%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fdib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.yqxbn7XTB9lGgNfaJ2T-p6nkFucFyn0cIb6FwoxIuq8Dh8qI9pE82CSDLefu8kNGwv33D76wqSZzMD6SgvTHEikW1Sx9Uh7SsZDGXM28Ia2QBL7R1Ed1ixxeQyrRiAdAOjMq8ucT9g5zaJIKfuqtbnmoQfejEtgEoSKa6O6Sblm1iopz2ztEq4Q2dxKJDfHdiPErGEE_grj7zLtuUrfHd_bKA8uEy-C_7uttBccL8KQ.w0Tthh5WuJtXz5gfTNWX29A_2QNCuL84lx9vlwnEIY4%26dib_tag%3Dse%26hvadid%3D694562032792%26hvdev%3Dc%26hvexpln%3D67%26hvlocphy%3D9197632%26hvnetw%3Dg%26hvocijid%3D307442656608753823--%26hvqmt%3De%26hvrand%3D307442656608753823%26hvtargid%3Dkwd-301078282219%26hydadcr%3D15521_13558544%26keywords%3Dthe%20wrinkle%20cure%20book%26mcid%3Da3a45f1a44723c6d93d8c1aba3932b30%26qid%3D1740672374%26sr%3D8-1%26tag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F02%2F27%2Fhealth%2Fceleb-dermatologists-3-day-nutritional-facelift-diet-revealed%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Wrinkle Cure&lt;/a&gt;,” he had his fair share of skepticism. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Famed journalist Diane Sawyer told him she believed his “claims were overstated and that she planned to challenge [him],” Perricone recalls in his new book, “&lt;a href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBeauty-Molecule-Introducing-Neuroceuticals-Breakthrough%2Fdp%2F1250286794%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F02%2F27%2Fhealth%2Fceleb-dermatologists-3-day-nutritional-facelift-diet-revealed%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Beauty Molecule&lt;/a&gt;,” due out April 15. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when Sawyer and Oprah Winfrey tested the nutritional facelift, they “could not believe their eyes when they witnessed the effects of the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/health/this-diet-lowers-risk-cancer-even-if-you-dont-lose-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/a&gt; after just three days.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“I designed this 3-day diet to reduce puffiness, enhance contours and firm the jawline,” he told The Post. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Subbotina Anna – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon, many others were blown away by how much &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/24/health/three-gym-rats-in-their-70s-and-80s-reveal-how-they-stay-fit-its-like-a-game-of-whack-a-mole/"&gt;younger they looked&lt;/a&gt; — and how energetic they felt — after following the meal plan for only 72 hours. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed this 3-day diet to reduce puffiness, enhance contours and firm the jawline — and including salmon twice daily will leave your skin firmer and more radiant,” Perricone told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/21/health/neurologist-reveals-3-ingredient-dinner-to-prevent-alzheimers/"&gt;Salmon&lt;/a&gt; is a crucial component of this diet. “You must eat salmon at least twice a day for the ideal effect,” he wrote, vowing it will “change your skin, making it firmer and more lustrous.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s because salmon provides good-quality, easily digestible protein that converts into amino acids “necessary to repair the body on a cellular level.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it might sound counterintuitive, Perricone claims a “carbohydrate-heavy and protein-light diet leads to the loss of contours in the face — the sought-after chiseled look of a well-defined jawline, cheekbones and eyes.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salmon is also a great source of the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/11/health/im-a-holistic-doctor-3-foods-that-mimic-ozempic/"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; EPA and DHA — which can help your brain, heart, metabolism, mood and skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Salmon is a great source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;volff – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Aside from salmon, the “three-day nutritional facelift” focuses on salads, berries and dark, leafy greens like spinach, arugula and kale. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/17/health/i-ate-only-raw-fruits-and-veggies-for-3-months-and-lost-77-lbs/"&gt;Berries&lt;/a&gt; are full of anti-inflammatory antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals, reduce oxidative stress and protect against cell damage. They’re also a good source of vitamin C, which aids in collagen production. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dark, leafy greens contain chlorophyll, which can help reduce redness and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/17/health/greek-island-with-almost-no-dementia-the-two-drinks-they-love/"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, as well as fight acne and eczema.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They’re also rich in vitamin E, which can lessen the effect of sun damage, beta-carotene, which reduces the appearance of fine lines and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/26/health/anti-aging-breakthrough-stop-wrinkles-gray-hair-with-these-hormones/"&gt;wrinkles&lt;/a&gt; — and vitamin K, which helps keep the skin nice and plump. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, Perricone’s diet demands at least six glasses of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/19/health/chemical-in-us-drinking-water-linked-to-higher-risk-of-2-cancers/"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; a day. He advises drinking two eight-ounce cans of hydrogen water — water that’s been enhanced with molecular hydrogen gas (H2) — every morning. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of his other tips include always eating protein first “as it helps slow down carbohydrate absorption, which results in control of insulin and glucose levels.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But most importantly? “Follow this diet to the letter,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dark, leafy greens contain chlorophyll, which can help reduce redness and inflammation, as well as fight acne and eczema. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;noirchocolate – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;       &lt;strong&gt;THE 3-DAY NUTRITIONAL DIET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;                                                                                          &lt;strong&gt;BREAKFAST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2-egg omelet or 4 to 6 ounces grilled, baked or poached salmon&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(Perricone does not recommend smoked salmon on the 3-day diet because of the high salt content. Otherwise, smoked salmon is fine.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2-inch slice of cantaloupe or ¹∕&lt;sub&gt;³ &lt;/sub&gt;cup fresh berries&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;6 to 8 ounces spring water (feel free to squeeze fresh lemon into the water if desired)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No juice, coffee or toast&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you normally have coffee to start your day, drink black or green tea to prevent caffeine withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;                                                                                                  &lt;strong&gt;LUNCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;4 to 6 ounces grilled, baked or poached poultry&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2 cups green salad, made with romaine lettuce and other dark, leafy greens such as spinach, arugula and kale. Top with 3 tablespoons cooked chickpeas. (Canned chickpeas are fine as long as you drain them.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Extra-virgin olive oil dressing, with fresh-squeezed lemon to taste&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1 apple or 1 pear or 2-inch slice cantaloupe or ¹∕&lt;sub&gt;³ &lt;/sub&gt;cup berries and 6 to 8 ounces spring water&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;                                                                                                  &lt;strong&gt;DINNER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;4 to 6 ounces freshly cooked — grilled, broiled or poached — salmon on 1 cup of warmed lentils&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Green salad (as described above)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;½ cup steamed vegetables, especially asparagus, broccoli and spinach (avoid root vegetables like potatoes, carrots, beets and parsnips)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2-inch slice cantaloupe&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;6 to 8 ounces spring water&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you follow this diet for three days to the letter, be ready for a great improvement in how you look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I remember someone in the community talking about their child who had been ‘vaccine injured’,” Johnson recalls. “It sparked a fear in me.” The science of vaccinations and immunization schedules also seemed impenetrable. “I was very conflicted, and felt like: ‘I don’t know any of this stuff, I didn’t go to school for this,’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;She wondered whether vaccinating her daughter had been a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Johnson joined “crunchy” Facebook groups full of moms concerned about potentially harmful substances affecting their children, and started taking advice from a trusted anti-vax family member who seemed particularly credible because she was a nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;With her next three children, Johnson chose not to vaccinate. This left them vulnerable to infections with high infant-mortality rates, like invasive pneumococcal disease, Haemophilus influenzae and whooping cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I felt I had done the quote-unquote research,” says Johnson. She read sources she thought were rational, like Suzanne Humphries and Roman Bystrianyk’s book Dissolving Illusions, which perpetuates the &lt;a href="https://vaccinarsinsardegna.org/en/science-knowledge/countering-disinformation/improved-hygiene-conditions-are-no-substitute-for-vaccinations" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;myth&lt;/a&gt; that hygiene, not vaccines, is primarily responsible for the decline of infectious diseases. She and her anti-vax community were convinced the medical system was corrupt, profiting from the distribution of unsafe, unnecessary vaccines. To them, not vaccinating their children was the hard but righteous thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Johnson soon began sharing what she had learned with others. “I had a decent following online. People were coming to me and listening to what I was sharing on the internet,” says Johnson, who remembers feeling a kind of “dopamine rush” when talking to other moms about vaccine “risks”. “I know that I led people down a path that now I totally regret,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;I know that I led people down a path that now I totally regret&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Nikki Hill Johnson, former anti-vaxxer&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Around 2020, Johnson’s perspective shifted abruptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;She started feeling like her MLM job was rigged: “I was having a lot of success, and then I wasn’t.

She also started listening to more online influencers who had expertise in epidemiology and public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Johnson changed her stance on vaccines, dubious wellness trends and diet culture. She was “exiled” from her mom groups but didn’t really mind. She asked her pediatrician to help catch her children up on vaccines as quickly as possible. “[Pediatricians] realize that people have gotten into this anti-vaccine rhetoric,” Johnson says. “They work with you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Today, Johnson has relinquished the anti-vax myths that once shaped her life and identity. For experts and activists, such stories offer a glimmer of hope. As vaccine skepticism grows in the US and whole communities become more vulnerable to preventable diseases, is it possible to break through the noise and get people the healthcare they need?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-anti-vax-sentiment-is-growing-in-the-us" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Why anti-vax sentiment is growing in the US&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The anti-vax movement first &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1181850/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;emerged&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-19th century in response to mandatory smallpox-vaccination laws. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, anti-vax activism was increasingly tied to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9981160/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rightwing politics&lt;/a&gt;, framed around fears of government overreach and threats to personal freedom. In recent years, fueled by distrust of medical institutions, Covid-19-related anxieties and social media misinformation, the shift has accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While vaccines may carry temporary side effects like soreness and fever, as well as the rare possibility of certain more serious risks like allergic reactions, no credible scientists who study infectious disease and epidemiology think that vaccines are remotely nearly as dangerous as the diseases they prevent, says Dr Joe Pierre, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California at San Francisco, and author of &lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/false-9780197765272" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;False&lt;/a&gt;.

She felt “kind of embarrassed”, Greene recalls, like just a panicky new mom making a big deal out of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Still worried, Greene went online. In a motherhood forum, she read about a frightening but &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6265562/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;false&lt;/a&gt; theory that babies lack a blood-brain barrier, making them vulnerable to brain injury from vaccines. “I found people saying: ‘They’re never going to admit it’s a vaccine side effect, but [your baby’s] brain is probably inflamed, she’s probably in pain,’” says Greene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Greene remembers a rising sense of panic and a distinct fear: “‘Something’s wrong with my kid.’” Subsequently, she decided not to vaccinate her next two children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"d2d2e910-ce74-45ae-a78e-faa4fe6998d7","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="d2d2e910-ce74-45ae-a78e-faa4fe6998d7" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Her awakening came at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, when she observed her anti-vax community “shunning the things they said prevented disease, like hygiene and masking”. To her, that seemed like “contrarianism, not critical thinking”. Moreover, Greene never found a single study supporting the notion that infants lack a blood-brain barrier, and was shocked to see some of the people in her anti-vax community online also claiming that the Earth is flat, which she thought was ludicrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-33" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Conspiratorial excesses are unlikely to alienate every believer. “On the contrary, cognitive dissonance, the tension that arises when our beliefs butt up against reality, is typically resolved by digging our heels in even deeper,” says Pierre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-importance-of-real-life-stories-in-changing-beliefs" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;The importance of real-life stories in changing beliefs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Still, some &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy-can-be-overcome-through-relatable-stories-and-accessible-information-169221" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; believe personal stories, like Johnson’s and Greene’s, are more persuasive than facts alone. To convince vaccine deniers, “scientific facts should be contextualized and made relatable to be understood as elements of a human experience”, write the authors of one 2021 report. &lt;a href="https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/why-vaccinate/personal-stories/?_gl=1*5x0fck*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTU5NzA5MTUyNi4xNzM4ODYzNjkw*_ga_CEHFEY8NBB*MTczODg2MzY4OS4xLjAuMTczODg2MzY4OS4wLjAuMA.." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Vaccine advocacy groups&lt;/a&gt; often feature personal stories as part of their education materials to convey the risks of preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Stories reveal the ways anti-vax ideology can cause harm, whether by increasing the risk of illness or distorting how children understand the world. Violet Adams, 32 (her name has been changed for her privacy), says that when she was growing up in British Columbia, her parents’ fear of vaccines instilled terror. “It’s very traumatizing as a child to hear things like: ‘The world is run by this evil, shadowy cabal,’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;At university, she saw firsthand that the science professors were “not brainwashed, not sheep” - and her beliefs began to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;To the general public, many vaccine-preventable diseases – say, polio or smallpox – can seem like relics of the distant past; people are not always familiar with their effects. Greene argues that public messaging should depict the consequences of vaccine-preventable diseases, saying: “[People] need to know what diphtheria looks like, how it closes off your airway until you suffocate and die.” Washington state’s former secretary of health Dr Umair Shah has &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/21/covid-vaccines-science-2024-election-00116520" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it may take the death of an influential figure to a vaccine-preventable disease to bring back wider acceptance of immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="cc631ad0-d06b-4128-ba8e-4bb530597b2f" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Dr Harry Seanor of Willard Parker hospital with polio survivor Mark Fresco, age eight, wearing a newer ‘Monaghan’ 1lb iron lung, and Ann Bohrer in an older-model lung, in New York on 22 June 1949.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Bettmann Archive&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Firsthand experience with vaccine-preventable diseases can be a wake-up call. In 2015, formerly anti-vax mother Kristen O’Meara watched all three of her children suffer through severe cases of rotavirus. “It was awful, and it didn’t have to happen, because I could have had them vaccinated. I felt guilty. I felt really guilty,” she later said in an &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/anti-vaxxer-mom-mind-kids-fall-ill/story?id=42351543" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;. The experience led her to reconsider her stance and vaccinate her children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Additionally, institutions “have to work on how to present the truth in ways that are psychologically appealing”, says Pierre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Conspiracy beliefs can be fueled by psychological needs like uniqueness, a sense of control and social affiliation, says Pierre. Crusading for the truth is a powerful feeling; think of Johnson’s “dopamine rush”. Greene has found meaning in helping others via vaccine advocacy – a different way to satisfy those needs. She is now a nurse and co-founder of &lt;a href="https://backtothevax.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Back to the Vax&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that connects previously vaccine-hesitant parents, and a representative for the organization &lt;a href="https://www.voicesforvaccines.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Voices for Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-information-and-support-can-help" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How information and support can help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Devon Greyson, a health information scientist, has studied mothers who changed their minds about vaccines in an effort to “reverse engineer” the process, they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In a 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667321522000221#sec4" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, Greyson interviewed 23 mothers in Vancouver, Canada, whose vaccine attitudes evolved over time, whether more in favor of vaccines or further against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Mothers who became more confident in vaccines described their shift as a cognitive journey “toward facts and away from fear”, guided by trustworthy health authorities and real-world experience, says Greyson. They benefited from non-judgmental support, opportunities to ask healthcare providers questions and the reassurance of seeing with their own eyes that vaccines didn’t harm their children. Greyson suggests this framework could be useful in communicating with vaccine-hesitant individuals: instead of simply telling them to “trust science”, encourage them to think scientifically – to ask questions of trusted experts, identify reliable sources and remain intellectually flexible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;If I’m susceptible, anybody can be susceptible&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Nikki Hill Johnson, former anti-vaxxer&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;By contrast, mothers who became more skeptical described their experience as a descent into fear and anxiety, often triggered by dismissive healthcare encounters. Feeling brushed off by doctors left them seeking answers elsewhere, like online communities that stoked their doubts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="753b2c6e-8187-4b0a-8b66-7f384014e5df" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":53,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Are you falling for wellness misinformation online?

Still, even small efforts to build trust, such as referring patients to reliable information and support, are “so important” in helping families make informed choices, says Martin, whose research focuses on Black Americans’ experiences in the healthcare system, including vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7908879/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that “&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00027162221087936" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prebunking&lt;/a&gt;”, or proactively warning people about vaccine conspiracies, is a promising approach. Resources like the &lt;a href="https://jitsuvax.info/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Jitsuvax project&lt;/a&gt;, co-created by psychologists, epidemiologists, behavioral scientists and clinicians from seven universities to combat misinformation, can help inoculate people against &lt;a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/explainers/anti-vaccine-conspiracies/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;particular conspiracies&lt;/a&gt; before they stumble upon them online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There’s no guaranteed way to snap someone out of anti-vax beliefs. But what helps is early, empathetic support from community and healthcare providers, and making space for people to change their minds as they embrace facts and critical thinking. Johnson, Adams and Greene changed their views not because they were debated into submission, but because they were open, flexible and secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Johnson is raising her kids with a solid foundation in scientific thinking. “I’m trying so hard to teach my kids critical-thinking skills,” Johnson says. “I feel like I’m a fairly smart person, and if I’m susceptible, anybody can be susceptible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 17:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPWjV4OTBfTUJ6V0k4RU1Qa3B5WTB0amRHWDNTTGhFQXRObHZKX1B3b0c0MXdCa2VSc25tSW5WWUtnR1Q3d1QzVkdqejhkeUV5aEU2RjJiZzVKSzdDajlqLTAzSkZWQjEwS1kzTXBJSHB6eFMyeUhtZm5lT2pmSlFYaTlBNUNtN29vVzRXZDF4Qms</guid></item><item><title>Measles cases reported in New Jersey, Kentucky amid ongoing outbreak in Texas - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPanRpQ0JGeTYxbEFQdUlvZE54M0kyelJ4ZzUxMkk5UC1jUkxWQk5yc1pLanA4dldMN1ZYYnNia2t3TVNQUkotMTA5Q3VLR2c1cEtlVkx4eU1Qa0JiXzA0cmc3TnlqOEppU1pwT3JxRDJPRV84dVVTaFZXUy1fUGt4Q1BXVnhVb0hralg2bVZpczRrcFNrZWxZR2Iwdk5qb2c4WU13N1l0OFnSAa4BQVVfeXFMT2VQR2FQTjVOUm1nMksta3pGTG5RakRIUVNSWUtoaGstREFvZUFQY1hwV0VPRVBZMUdzQnJvTWU3X0REMnFqMl9TN0cxZ21kbmU1aFo0V1MxTFI4WXQ2b3AyUG9DaU1rZGpUUm5qbm96LXRqb0RLaldYeU1SaWdmZzdSdkVXaWNEX2dLaXdVTUtFNmo5N3BiNGp1LUJKVklNOWtLejFfcEU2UmIxOVJB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;More measles cases are being confirmed across the United States as health officials work to treat patients in an ongoing outbreak in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH) and the Franklin County Health Department &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.chfs.ky.gov/News/Documents/Health%20Officials%20Announce%20Measles%20Case%20in%20Kentucky.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday a confirmed case of measles in an adult resident, the first in the state in two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The departments said the resident recently traveled internationally to an area where measles is spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, in New Jersey, health officials &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nj.gov/health/cd/topics/measles.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed two new measles cases&lt;/a&gt; in Bergen County linked to a patient whose case was confirmed earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Officials haven't found any links between the cases in Kentucky and New Jersey, and there's no evidence the cases in Kentucky or New Jersey are connected to the outbreak in Texas, which has so far sickened 124 people and led to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/1st-measles-death-linked-outbreak-texas-confirmed-child/story?id=119208967" target="_blank"&gt;one death in an unvaccinated school-aged child&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Kentucky health officials are now attempting to contact anyone the infected resident may have come into contact with.
